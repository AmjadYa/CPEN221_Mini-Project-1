4.5,W,take notes for a grade read assigned chapters hw test are over lecture readings extra credit does not let you fail amazing at help a semester research paper pgs but if you ask her for help visit her office working hard an easy a bc she helps you out so much you will learn if dedicated
4.0,W,professor ledbetter may seem a little all over the place okay she really is all over the place read the textbook a test every couple of weeks a lecture and reading there for help all you have to do is ask she has plenty of material to help you with your topics for her research paper i really enjoyed her class
1.0,W,papers for a short summer term please do yourself a favor and take her class tough grader endless homework
4.5,W,pat ledbetter is extremely knowledgeable and certainly knows this subject inside and out she is very involved with the online students as she would email me right back if ever i had any issues or questions she interacts with the class in the discussion forums as well i must tell you however that you do need to do the work she likes to assign writing papers and her tests can be challenging but if you aim to learn and do the work you will learn she is very good at what she does but she is pretty tough
2.5,W,not fully comprehend half of the time what she is saying if you have not taken spanish before or during high school do not take her she did not explain the materials really well her tests are easy if you know spanish tests drops
2.5,W,meh she was alright take her again for an easy a but if you worry about your grades throughout out the semester and want to physically see them on blackboard not the teacher for you because she always takes forever to post grades
5.0,M,his enthusiasm was contagious and i even appreciated his quirks i still display those brass and copper mobiles in my living room judging from the other ratings i was very lucky to get on his good side
4.0,W,she is funny in a sarcastic way lectures are all over the place because she is clearly passionate about her class but the tests are easy with minimal studying and before every exam she does a review
5.0,W,great professor very enthusiastic and cares about her students she is so genuine and nice i hate history so this class was boring for me but very easy her tests are easy if you go to the review she tells you whats going to be on the test the class before the test she give out on her essays but its ok overall great woman
5.0,W,i loved professor she was great her lectures could be a bit boring sometimes but she always tried to keep everyone engaged in class she gives essays and tests and non-cumulative final the tests are easy she gives a review but the essays can be a bit difficult she can be a tough grader on the essays easy to get a b on them
4.0,W,loves history passionate but is an extremely tough grader on her four essays most people attended class only for tests power points posted online but you would have read for extra materialdetails extremely organized
4.5,W,professor is very smart and she knows what talking shes also very passionate about history so her lectures are very detailed her mannerisms are hilarious and i would love to take her class again she grades a little tough on papers but not too bad papers exams including the final which cumulative
4.0,W,is an amazing teacher really gets into her lectures and captures your interest as if she is telling you a story in class four essays need the textbook to have successful papers tests are easy attendance mandatory but go to the review sessions before the test she basically tells you whats going to be on them great class
2.0,W,she grades tough i had another teach re grade papers and the grades where very different
3.0,W,her class was offered to me through apus she was very helpful though there were quite a bit of essays and you truly had to try for your grade we also had to read a novel chosen from her list for the final essay but her grading on the final essay was very lenient
4.5,W,the course itself uses no textbook so she has her own slides she posts the comes directly from these slides she is not a easy marker but a fair marker if you write a b grade answer expect that grade read those slides and expect an b or higher also she adjusts deadlines and grades if need be overall very kind professor
4.5,M,i love kent so yeah work but he is ultra nice and helpful you know exactly what essays you will have on tests so if you prepare those in advance that helps a ton the hardest thing is his tf on exams he loves teaching and always remembers name always study a couple hours every day and you should be good
4.5,M,hardestsmartest professor ever met in my life he was even the co-author of our textbook that many colleges use lol i only earned an a in his class because of his incredible teaching ability he will fill the entire board up multiple times per lecture but you better write every word of it down he never gets off topic and always helps you
4.5,M,dr kent is my favorite teacher he is very thorough and tells you everything you need to know studying is a must for this class especially for the essay questions but he gives study guides that literally has everything on it you will need so helpful always made time if i understand something also gives amazing extra credit
4.0,M,dr class is tough but his willingness to help makes a good grade possible however because he is so passionate about what he teaches he is extremely thorough as long as you mind putting in the hard work kent is a great teacher he truly cares about the success of his students i had him for l and taking him again for
4.5,W,have taken many classes with gel highly recommended if you want to learn how to dance go to her
5.0,M,amazing take him for he knows what he is doing gpa booster
1.5,M,lectures were extremely unclear the first midterm was a disaster no one knew what he was asking tries to be helpful but makes students uncomfortable instead he will interrupt you throughout your entire presentation making it very difficult to keep things flowing the content of the class is good but the instruction of it was very poor
2.0,M,ian is a weird guy and not a great instructor but easy enough to do well if you readmemorize the textbook and show up to class he loves to hear himself speak so hard to have meaningful conversations his marking is inconsistent and ambiguous at times he really lecture so you have to read and memorize the book to do well
2.0,M,he will not look over any rough drafts for papers you may have the electronic journals are the biggest nuisances you will ever get his tests are very random and rely on very small facts from the books you have read do not be late do show up to every class do your electronic journals and you should be fine
1.5,W,course is listed as online but should be shown as hybrid because you have to go to campus for tests have to email her multiple times before receiving a response and by that point it is too late uninterested in helping students in anyway horrible at clarifying what needs to be done if you take her course you will regret it
4.0,M,freaking love this guy i think his f bomb record is a class takes nothing seriously but really really knows his stuff his goals are to make us laugh and help us view the world around us with a healthy dose of criticism humor probably one of my fave people on the planet
2.0,M,he always went over the scheduled end time if you have word for word answers on the exam you would not receive full credit the subject was boring to begin with and he made the class even more boring not very professional only plus he never made you do busy work everything had a purpose
5.0,M,i took him for semesters of hebrew and he was one of the greatest professors i ever had
3.0,M,he likes to go on and on about his whole lifestory do not expect him to stay on topic most of the things you learn in this class will be from the textbook not from him he only took attendance times so a lot of people skipped many of his classes and just did the readings but he assign any papers or homework other than that nice
3.5,M,a very nice and lenient professor he does tend to go off topic during lectures unfortunately we get to finish all the chapts and topics during my fall semester honestly i just think getting old but not a bad professor although he only took attendance sometimes best to show up to know what will be on tests no hw
1.0,M,a junior and a i took him during my first semester at bc his class is still the only class in my life that gotten a c in his exams have nothing to do with the textbook and his lectures are not coherent writing this review because i want to make sure other students make the same mistake i did take him
2.0,M,very unclear long rambling lectures very self-centered man lectures were about himself and about the material test questions had some surprises content that you can be sure was never covered in class he is sadly nearly tenured
1.0,M,prof class was horrible not only did i get nothing out of his class but it was the first class i got a c in always received a b or an a in a psyc class he gets off topic in a heartbeat so you end up lost hes so disorganized some people should not be allowed to teach please do not take him or regret it as i have now
1.0,M,if you have barely any interest in the subject of psychology i fully recommend taking his class for you will pass he took most of the time in class to talk about his personal life barley uses the textbook two tests plus a final drops the lowest grade he was so behind on teaching us that he gave every student a for the second exam
2.0,M,eaaaasy grade just show up didnt need to pay attention half of the time never used the textbook and still passed only tests lowest score is dropped very much a story telling teacher mostly about his personal life and random things going on in class
1.0,M,i am a junior with a and he is the worst teacher i have ever had he skips steps in processes which makes everyone lost is never in his office during his office hours always late to class and receiving text messages and phone calls puts homework on the syllabus and never mentions it and expects it to be done take him
2.5,M,he knows his stuff but not there for his students very distant professor and not very approachable very harsh grader do not take if you are not an english major
1.0,M,if a student who is horrible at taking exams or actually have a life and have to work in order to pay for college do not take any course with professor kurylo his class is exams and attendance no extra credit no project and no presentation he does not care if you fail
5.0,M,i thought he was weird at first but i grew to love his weirdness i love his sarcasm i only pay attention to catch the few sarcastic jokes he throws out good guy teaches clearly he also makes funny faces without noticing super interesting haha
5.0,M,prof kurylo is not the typical college professor that just want you to memorize a bunch of stuff and then feed it back on a paper he really expect you to think on his test it is more benefit for you to understand why rather than just study like a robot
4.0,M,this is my third time taking one of classes and i am still very happy with his teaching and testing techniques the test are fairly difficult but there is always a curve as long as you are a good note taker you will be fine also read the stories and diagrams in the textbook almost always at least one question related to them on exam
3.5,M,delamater is incredibly knowledgeable and has a lot to say this can work against him however because he will often go on and on about something that could have been said in minutes he is also disrespectful--making students feel embarrassed for saying the wrong thing mocking students rolling his eyes
2.5,M,i dont recommend him he know how to explain no extra credit no homework no study guide three exams extremely hard you have to study on your own and read the book a few times to get the concepts well
2.0,M,professor abramov where do i even begin his notes are confusing and his tests are extremely hard he comes into class talks for minutes and then you leave and have to read the textbook front to back the final was chapters he should retire expect to self teach yourself everything he is too difficult for an introduction course
5.0,M,personally i think he is the best professor in brooklyn college simply not enough space to tell you all the good things about him he really makes it easy to do well in a tough class show up to class and take notes make sure you understand the material and you will do not just fine but get an a if you want to understand stats you must take him
4.5,M,he is the best for statistics homework total super eas y if you go to class three exams including the final and you are allow to bring cheats sheets for the three exams also the final is very easy take him if you want to learn statistics
4.5,M,i have other stats classes that i have taken to compare him to and hands down i wish i would have had him first one of the most understanding statistics professors ever had makes the lessons clear to understand offers extra help in any way he can the material is hard but you leave understanding statistics the way he teaches it
5.0,M,psych stats is difficult but having professor kozbelt alleviates some of the challenge i love that he is very fair very helpful clear he is organized knows what he is doing and makes everyone in the class feel like they can ask questions sitting in a lecture hall i was surprised when he remembered my name kozbelt is very professional
1.5,M,a terrible lecturer goes on tangents so often he also sometimes confuses himself sitting in class i hear a lot of snickering from the classmates when he says something that make sense which is a lot my ta is respectful but even he knew that the lecturers help much mc tests are vague prelim averages were
1.0,M,actually the worst professor had at cornell i care if he is a brilliant researcher he had no investment in the class terrible lectures and had no care whatsoever what students took away from his class truly terrible
1.0,M,i remember that in the first lecture prof hirschl was making his powerpoint slides in class yes in class while he was lecturing his lectures were so random he started off talking about the reading made a few completely unrelated points and he started criticizing some other sociologist and then another sociologist and then another
1.0,W,i do not recommend her at all i would avoid her as much as possible treats you like a high school student poor time management skills she got many problem wrong in from of the class in a row does not know material copies straight from book
1.0,W,avoid at all costs because she does not use canvas and will never tell you what your grade is because she also teaches high school and uses that as an excuse
1.0,W,the worst professor ever had at pcc she basically copies the textbook to the board and she calls that a lecture she even able to answer any questions it really made me wonder why i was in that class i do not recommend you to take her even if you are good at math her class will bore you to death
3.0,W,okay so i am going to start with the good things because this professor a terrible person just really tough she stops for questions students have her grading is really tough though on tests she deducts many points for small mistakes even for handwriting if math your thing its going to be tough homework is worth almost nothing
1.0,W,never ever ever ever take her im in class right now we just got another test and more than half the class failed she teach well but she grades you work even worse she will take all your points for the dumbest reason
3.0,W,the material we learn is definitely not hard she is a nice and some what a humorous teacher she has helpful methods there are a few things i would say she is very picky on how she wants the homework done it is graded based on correct answers you are not allowed a calculator and she kinda gets frustrated when you interrupt to ask a question
3.5,M,very good at explaining complicated concepts in a simple way and is helpful if you reach out to him but his tests are impossible the calc class i took was an hour and mins and he requires his tests to be completed during class period the tests are very long and if you go over time he deducts points because of this i am failing
3.5,M,moliassa is a really odd guy he gets a little too enthusiastic about math a good guy though and really helpful good at making difficult topics easy to understand going to class is necessary to passing
5.0,M,the most accurate review read of this prof is the one below me rest are exaggerating yes tough but do you really think nursing school is easy sorry to say heck no and about the accent really if normal human can make it through his class everyone can not hard to understand him he teaches excellent and is a doctor himself
4.0,M,prof strong really cares about you yes his tests are difficult but coming from a former professor from ut health what do you expect he trains you for nursing school because keep in mind nursing school is not easy i recommend taking him if you can accept the challenge because in the long run you will learn an awful amount
2.5,M,a good teacher but there enough time to study for that much information when you have family and kids really critical on studying and test what you think you really know where the exam is coming from he give reviews or study guides
1.5,M,its very hard to understand him he wont give you reviews for any exam not very helpful please buy hes book we even use it and its very expensive
1.0,M,apart from his hard to understand jamaican accent he tends to skip topics and trick you on test for ex on one exam multiple choice he didn tell us that there was more than one answer so while grading he mentioned it and most of the class pass really btw no extra credit no reviews given beware of this professor it is not helpful
2.0,W,think twice before taking this class with her she is nice but when grading her papers and the exams is the opposite
3.0,W,attendance is absolutely mandatory she does not put the power points online which kind of stinks her tests are hard and require a lot of studying nice lady though
5.0,W,she is amazing honestly the most intelligent and realistic professor i have had she is so smart and funny i actually wait for class she is so interesting and helpful i will take her every chance i get love her
3.5,M,he knows his stuff and has a high skill level when it comes to talking to people though he is way too delicate hem and haw for an hour instead of just saying that looks bad let me tell you why but when you coax it out of him his insights and feedback are invaluable gain more skill in this class than in most of any subject
4.0,M,super funny and nice guy his class is pretty easy and you can retake your assignments
5.0,M,a caring loving easy going and funny he is by far a great teachers there no way to fail his class no way
5.0,M,a great professor he gives good feedback the class was very interesting
4.5,M,taken his next semester for two different classes no test and lot of movies he is great lay back over all a very good teachers you will not fail
5.0,M,he is fascinated by what he teaches and it actually inspired me to learn not many teachers can do that he really cares about his students asks us questions to make sure he is teaching the subject well enough one of my favourite professors
3.5,M,nice guy and amazing lecturer certainly knows his mcluhan however between the take home exams and essay you are ending up writing a lot certainly more than any other poli sci lecture or seminar
4.5,M,professor tarkow makes any topic interesting i had him for two separate classes and it was obvious that he really cares about his students and his classes he can explain any concept and make it easy to understand but he also pushes you to discover things for yourself you get out what you put in so definitely do the required readings
3.0,M,you have to read a lot of books there are pop quizzes one research paper a midterm and final he was pretty relaxed with the pop quizzes and let us work with other people he seems interested in what he is teaching the lectures could be really boring though
3.5,M,alright his lectures are long and unclear because he tells us to write down random adjectives i read one of the books and still passed with an a though mid term and final exam research paper and weekly quizzes lecture slides are online
5.0,M,if you actually talk to him he is really sweet if he knows you from talking with you he will help you out most of the quizzes are group quizzes and he gives you the answers and extra credit you have to read a lot but a lot is from the lectures i would definitely recommend
2.0,M,he is a horrible teacher give good lectures rambles on and on i would never have him as a professor again
3.5,M,dr andrews is a great professor i loved his class he gives many extra credit opportunities you just need to read all of the texts to pass
1.0,M,i was expecting this class to be easy it is not this is a lecture class you can expect to have a reading assigned every singe class period and half the time he unclear about what needs to be read i had multiple quizzes where the questions were irrelevant to the story that was read i have to take this class again with a different prof now
1.5,M,he seems to be confused in his own lectures he gives you information then has test on something completely different
3.5,M,great professor clear on explaining chem have to say i learned a lot by taking his class i definitely recommend him
4.0,M,very strict at first but lightens up as the semester goes on a tough but fair grader but gives good feedback to help you improve he explains the readings and what he expects on the essays if you bother showing up to class his lectures are dry but have great content
3.5,M,i am terrible at physics i got a b in physics from hess but i got an a in this class and it was one of the most accomplishing grades i have ever achieved he is hilarious and lectures will keep you entertained i spent almost every day in the physics tutor lab and it paid off lectures are only mandatory for attendance iclicker points
5.0,M,professor king makes it easy for his students he gives weekly quizes and one cumulative final exam at the end there are study guides to help prepare students for the quizes final exam
5.0,M,dedicate at least a day to doing problems per chapter the exams too difficult but they are tricky so you need to know your stuff a good prof practice the problems he posts at the end of lectures and pass go to tutorials for extra practice questions and get at least a b i stress go to tutorials if you can
1.0,M,would not recommend anyone to take his online course according to hassan as far as i know this course has never audio or vedio lectures because they are not developed by the departmentschool so we have to read the text book and then post any questions on any concept or methods i will address it ta worked pretty hard
5.0,M,bob is awesome end of story take him and look back makes a tough subject easy lectures reflect the test directly
5.0,M,dr robert bender is the best professor at utd he opens many ways to earn extra bonuses credits there are exams lowest grade drop he gives a very good exams review with questions answers keys days the exam day so you can study it at the end no one left behind b thank you dr robert bender
5.0,M,ignore the last reviews bs bob do ec and no paper there are exams he writes online hmwk and department-wide final he write bob is great and his exams easy but he gives you great reviews the final sucks bob never sees it so he can only help so much do well on exams need it
3.5,W,i took studies in writing as a required course for english ed but this is a creative writing course wrote creative papers which i had never done before she grades easily and pities you if you a creative writing major does not do much during class time besides talk about the books but there are no testsquizzes sweet lady
1.0,W,not helpful not consistent with what she said would be covered on telling stories not teaching it is supposed to an awesome course with real life information needed and practice the prof is away from it
5.0,M,i strongly recommend dr giarratani he is a master economist he lectures from the book but he does a fabulous job of explaining the material he also puts his lecture slides online the non-mandatory homework and readings are important for the tests his tests are reasonable and it is easy to do well if you understand the material
5.0,M,dr giarratani is a department head and an internationally respected economist he might not be the most riveting public speaker but he sure does have a lot of insightful things to say he is a fair grader and has reasonable expectations do the recommended book problems and go to him for help if you need to--test questions are often identical
3.5,W,a wonderful professor she provides a clear outline of the course and sticks to it there are in-class readings and discussions for participation points no exams but a few pop quizzes just read what she says to read research paper is of your grade but she lets you submit drafts and she is there every step of the way if you need her
1.0,M,worst teacher i ever had has no clue what he is talking about he teaches a concept decides it is wrong and reteaches it again but tests you on the wrong one i took advanced honors physics in high school and got an a but struggled to get a c in this class i basically self-taught in this class
5.0,W,make copies of the practice exam and continue doing it until your successful make copies of the lessons and do along with her videos in lab do all homework first then your quizzes your quizzes are on the test so practice the unit exam too
5.0,W,ms dameron is very clear with what is expected and how she grades she emails how-to videos regularly provides good notes and worksheets and offers online students to come to campus to study with that class for tests she wants you to learn and pass the best teacher had at tcc
5.0,W,mrs dameron is a wonderful teacher she makes it easy and fun to pass her class anyone who need to take math class should take it with her
1.0,W,she is nice and wants you to pass but none of her lectures match up to the work that you have to do for mymathlab i am taking an online only class and it is probably the hardest thing i have ever taken since start college two years ago her lectures do not help and you will have to spend most of your time looking for other lessons online
2.0,W,i went into this class excited because one of those losers that actually likes architectural history mourna is the worst professor if you think you study hard wrong never had a class that was as awful as this one and i cried a lot if you want to talk to the professor she has a pretty interesting life but take the class
5.0,M,hands down best math teacher ever had if you ever have any questions go to office hours i went almost every week with homework questions and he was so so so helpful his tests and homework are fair he drops your lowest quiz as well he is a very clear and organized lecturer and is extremely approachable and helpful sweet sweet guy
5.0,M,professor burk is awesome best math teacher i have ever had he truly cares about his students and goes to great lengths to make sure that everyone understands the material
2.0,M,wandling is extrememly confusing and frustrating he use a powerpoint for most of his lectures which makes it difficult to understand what exactly you need to know for the exams you get your grades through the not him there is a lot of reading for each class and is difficult to understand at the beginning of the semester
5.0,M,fred stewart is one of best professors ever had his class lectures are always interesting and keeps your attention class has easy writing assignments and tests that are easy because they cover vocabulary definitely an easy a if you put in a little effort have to take the final if your grade is high enough would take him again
3.5,M,very nice professor who is always clear on his material study the syllabus and take good notes and pass the tests but only can be an easy a if you put some effort in can be an easy f if you never show up or study for the tests
4.0,M,gallaher is an awesome professor the course content is not easy but he makes it bearable he is very funny and cracks jokes frequently i really respect him as a professor while you the grading is not the quickest he provides very individualized feedback and it makes the wait worth it if you need help outside of his course he will provide it
4.0,M,he teaches organic chemistry it is kind of hard to make organic appealing but he finds a way he has a funny sense of humor the class is hard but it is due to the subject material itself he is always there if you need help his tests are extremely difficult but he tries to be as helpful as possible one of the nicest professor at carlow
2.0,M,i took with mr peters honestly the only reason why i passed is because the class is basically common sense he is knowledgeable and excited about the subject but he talks more than teaches his notes always align with the book his logic grading is confusing he talks fast and lacks enough patience to teach a class avoid him
4.0,W,she is a very friendly and enthusiastic teacher really easy class just had to give four speeches and take two online tests easy grader cancels class or ends early a lot so it would be good to take her last in the day an issue some people might have is she talks about your speech right after you do it in front of the class
4.0,M,this class was so much fun expect to go outside alot the tests are hard but he gives so much extra credit impossible to fail just a great guy and loves nature
5.0,M,professor sterner is he best he is the nicest man i have ever met he truly cares about his students and only wants them to do well i would take his class again anyway and i am not even smart in science we go outside when its nice out and his extra credit projects are so much fun
5.0,M,mr b is the best speech professor anywhere i hate public speaking but mr b made us feel comfortable and laid back he grades on improvement not by expectation meaning if you do poorly on one speech but try harder and do better on the next one he will take that improvement into account and boost your grade he just wants to see you try
5.0,W,she is one of the best dance teachers i have ever had very clear and very helpful
5.0,M,i took professor burns for calc ii this professor really knows his stuff he is very funny and is willing to explain to you until you understands the material he give practice test before exam and it goes over if you study the practice test you will pass the exam recorded his lecture posted on youtube any time you could access and review
5.0,M,prof burns absolutely loves to help students with math he will spend as much time as you need to help you understand it he offers multiple ways of solving a problem lets you decide what works for you he always makes you feel good about learning something keeps you interested during the class does not call on you if you dont want to be
4.0,W,professor siegfried believes that her students are capable and intelligent so she pushes your limits more than any professor ever had however the work is worth it taking two classes from professor siegfried shakespeare and film and feminist literary theory have challenged and changed my world view every ounce of work is worth it
1.0,M,dr hardy is extremely rude he will laugh in your face about questions you ask at one point he told me he wasnt talking to me anymore also he is not willing to work with you when you have a issue our online system calculates grades wrong i received a d but if you calculate it it adds up to a b he still fix it saying it his issue
3.0,M,very nice guy he comes off very quiet at first but he really does love his students you do have to try he will push you for assignments and projects but only because he wants to see everyone do their best
1.0,M,this class was just him trying to prove to the students that he was a good parent he is very arrogant and self consumed he provided no help and did not even bother to learn our names he also cancelled class way to many times and we probably did not cover half of the material we were supposed to if you want to learn do not take him
2.0,M,he cancled class too often and the material half was intro-psyc and the other half was his life story this teacher is concieted and self righteous rarely alowing students to explain themselves when a question is asked instead he opts to hear himself speak easy enough if you can memorize and regurgitate take if you actualy want to learn
2.0,W,i have trouble understanding why all of the other reviews are so positive she was an easy grader but we had to do excessive research for oral presentations also she made many political comments that were unrelated to the course regarding feminism the aca the iraqi war etc her comments were unprofessional at best do not recommend
5.0,W,bvb is the best absolutely life-changing and one of the leading experts in her field so so brilliant such a wonderful person who truly wants her students to do well is willing to go above beyond to help tests are hard so you need to put in the work and skip class textbook is usually a cd of images that you will use
4.0,W,bvb is great really passionate about her field and her knowledge and research is impressive she wants you to be as passionate about the information as she is clear about assignments and will gladly clarify that being said there is so much information to memorize for exams and her tests cover a lot of material

2.0,M,dr burton requires his students to write weekly a lot work if you miss class it will hurt grade even if you complete all the work i take him again
2.0,M,he is the worst teacher ever had he is very rude and care about the students
2.5,M,rob burton while a very interesting instructor who is at times thought-provoking to listen to i will not take again he has a very weird grading scale reading specific blogs which are the primary source of our grades in this class are graded not with letter grades or percentages but rather smiley-faces he is also quite sarcastic
2.0,W,if i wanted to be talk to like a kid id go to a day care this woman talk to her students like we are years old
1.5,W,she is all over the place quizzes time you meet she expects that you can write a perfect essay in minutes these are her quizzes tons of reading to do along with participation essays at the end of the class which is timed graded as well as the quizzes she is extremely picky when she grades get a b if you lucky
4.5,M,dr gallaher is a fantastic teacher and truly cares about the success of his students he gives amazing examples and uses many anecdotes in class in order to help students understand the material he is most definitely the best english teacher met in my collegiate career and glad i had a chance to take comp with him
5.0,M,this class was amazing its not your usual or page writing course he makes things very engaging and different we pretty much never used the book and the writing assignments were super easy also we practically never stayed the whole class time
4.0,M,i was not a fan of human geography however urban geography was my favorite class was very interesting and he used multiple relevant examples i would definitely take another class in the level with dr eberts
2.5,W,take symmetry most pointless and confusing class ever taken not a bad professor but the subject is just very confusing and abstract it was a very awkward class she will assign homework that make any sense mainly because the textbook makes no sense i would not recommend anyone taking this class
1.5,W,terrible professor does not know how to teach would not recommend taking her unless math is your strength if taken calculus before its very easy but still rough to sit through
3.0,W,professor hall is very nice and helpful but her class can get boring at times all the homework is on the syllabus and usually due once every other week when homework is due you have a quiz sometimes she gets confusing but as long as you keep up with the work get a b will have to work a little bit for an a
2.0,W,she is such a hard grader and i would never ever want to take a class with her again the tests also rarely make sense and the homework follow the noteslecture at all
1.5,W,worst class my first semester of freshman year she is very disorganized her lectures are all over the place so it is hard to take notes which also makes it hard to study for her exams her grading criteria and prompts are unclear leaving you with little to no idea on how to do for tests do not recommend
2.0,W,she assigns a lot of readings but you can get by without doing them as long as you take notes in class harsh grader on papers she give many guidelines then corrects aspects that she did not say were necessary very disorganized lost our midterms and did not handle it well i do not recommend taking this class
2.0,M,this guy loves to hear himself talk from the time class starts until the very end talking everything he says comes right from the book the tests are outrageous and the papers are incredibly hard a nice enough guy but a horrible instructor
3.0,M,a nice guy but his teaching style is extremely boring this class was one night a week three hours and he give any breaks which be so bad if he mixed things up a bit the three papers we had for the class were on topics that only got touched on the week before the due date tough grader take a class with him again
1.0,W,anita is a nice person but she generally has no idea what she is talking about and is usually completely unprepared for her lessons the book actually tries to show you the content of the course i have doubts if she has ever read it beware of her extreme problems with clarity and habits of assigning homework through email at random
1.0,W,she has never once lectured or taught any material the entire class stupid reading quizzes every weekend all you do is show up to class she gives you a group presentation to prepare in minutes and you teach the class yourself she requires you too write ridiculous long papers for certain assignments a horrible level class
1.0,W,she is clearly over her head and has no idea what she doing she talks to hear herself be friendly has no true industry in-site that does not come out of a book she plays favorites and is straight up two faced never take courses or the gaming degree from this school
3.5,W,she let the class use technology to take notes but it matter as she provided the power point slides on icon all i had to do was print them off i recommend taking notes directly on the power point slides she provides for the class exams are over lectures and the textbook she explains everything in detail a lot of extra credit
3.0,W,subtly sneaks her political views into lectures liberal extremely condescending says at least once a week oh too young to know who x is when x is a prominent politician or celebrity tries to hold our hands through lectures take notes on weirdobvious examples she rewords them and has them as a test question
4.0,W,great professor little bit hard and there are many things to read but very intelligent and try really really hard to help students if you actively ask for help you will get an a not easy class but if you try you can get an a a range is quite wide as well she gives lots and lots of extra credits
4.0,W,never have i felt like been in high school while college until i took her class she values class room participation and daily homework completion more than any other instructor had
2.0,W,although senora zahajko is a very pleasant and charming lady she is very hard to learn from as a teacher she expects you to spend hours a day on homework then even grade most of it so you know if getting it right she zooms through new material and have time to answer students questions do not recommend her
3.0,W,have to work very hard attendance is a must lots of high graded hw i learn more by studying the material with hw as a guide not doing hours of fill in the blanks a in and b in w all extra credit and it being my only class passionate but needs to adjust her teaching style wish there was another daytime professor
5.0,W,i have taken her a year ago and now i am taking her second class span she is one of my favorite teacher in nsc this is because i learned so many valuable things through taking her class i am now speaking languages including spanish just take her class if you are interested in learning spanish
1.0,M,panzarella has the weirdest grading system and his lectures are long boring and irrelevant a small writing assignment is due everyday but it is so easy although he is not the best teacher this class is an easy a
5.0,M,great professor explains everything with clarity literally what he talks about in class on the test i would take him again
4.0,M,i am glad he was my capstone professor because i enjoyed his class so much most of the class involves group work so find good partners on the first day his personality is something you have to be prepared for as he can be a little abrasive to sensitive people sometimes assignment reqs were unclear but he does everything to help you understand
4.0,M,absolutely amazing take him if you can his class is mostly online meets about once a week during class he more so gives life lessons speaks from experience he want anyone to fail never had a prof who cares so much about their well-being online tests online final weekly discussions a few papers it
2.5,M,at first it was interesting in the beginning of classes we have to mediate we are not allowed to have necklaces of course you cant have jeans he assigns you with a partner to study the karate moves sometimes its annoying
3.5,W,this class is a definite gpa booster about half of the time you even be in class the entire time if you have questions she answers them fully the course layout was very easy to interpret
3.5,M,his lectures were pretty pointless in my only attended class on the days we had class he sends you an e-mail of all the readings that will be on the quizzes the only thing was there was so many articles to read and he really wanted you to know the dates of things but funny and approachable during class would recommend
4.5,M,an inspirational lecturer to say the least we had to maintain an online blog aside from his weekly quizzes
5.0,M,will not disappoint amazing lectures you be bored very helpful and funny prof as well always there to talk or give advice if you have the chance take his courses one of the best professors had the pleasure to know in my years as an undergrad
4.5,W,very nice woman projects are fun and easy to complete imo always there for students but sometimes to the extent of being a pushover re due dates and quality like most of art courses critiques are too lax and the quality of work is severely overrated she is also the advisor for the graphic design club
4.5,W,mrs hays is a very sweet lady she seems to genuinely care about everyone and wants you to do well however she does get annoyed if you are talking to someone while she is no food or cell phone allowed in class she will literally call you out just be respectful and pay attention you will receive an easy a
1.5,W,she is never there and does not help much the quizzes are very hard and hurt your grade i would not take her class unless you absolutely have to
1.0,W,she is not a good teacher
4.0,W,basically the boss in accounting department might intimidate you at first then you realized she just have time for non-sense and casual talking her slides are informative but notes are strongly recommended because i found it a bit difficult to figure it out if i missed the class good luck
4.0,W,hands down one of the best professors ever had very clear and concise extremely helpful and passionate about what she teaches do not hesitate to take her
4.0,M,i really enjoyed professor class really funny and easy going there are only exams midterm final from what i can remember and both take home there is one presentation but it is with a partner and its super easy he has one short paper pages and one long paper pages this is an easy class to get a wi credit
4.0,M,he is a great prof his assignments are not always the clearest but is really willing to work with you he makes class fun i would recommend taking him for your english class
2.5,M,for a class with freshman non-english majors the class was rough he expects a lot from his students and you have to work to improve your grade there was little substantive feedback on the essays and in class the classes were more discussion based he expected us to comprehend and work at the level of juniors or seniors
2.5,M,great guy horrible professor he would be a great professor for students not taking an intro course he is very unclear in his expectations and has major mood swings kicked whole class out twice for things we have no control over probably the reason the theatre department is not strong at ua would take as a sr but maybe not as a fresh or soph
1.5,W,be prepared to fight for mediocrity unless you are on her good side i took this class after i took editing so i knew a fair amount about ap style and news but she refuses to give good grades if you are a comms major who likes to kiss up you might do well english majors beware would not recommend at all no help extra effort does not matter
5.0,W,gilson is hands down one of the best professors i have taken at ou so far and this class even for my she is so inspirational hilarious and down right fantastic expect to write duh but have tons of fun while doing it she legitimately made me think i chose the wrong major for myself just because of how interested i became
1.5,M,the first few lectures i was wowed with his lecturing ability but this wore off as i realized he said the same thing over and over and over again i also do not think that his course was well described in the description on line the readings were horrible and most hard to understand all he talks about storytelling every lecture the whole time
4.5,M,held amazing lectures and let you know exactly what you need to do to pass the course though he is a tough marker the lecture material definitely had the potential to be boring but allard made everything interesting and fun
5.0,M,dr lectures were very engaging and he truly wants all of his students to be successful i hope to be able to take more of dr classes in the future
2.5,M,professor allard was a fairly solid professor you could certainly tell that he was interested in what he was teaching sometimes it was hard for me to get anything out of the lectures however because i felt some stuff he was talking about relevant and i had a hard time knowing what to write i felt that he was also a hard marker
4.5,M,loved this class no previous knowledge of the course and thought it was going to be very challenging but his lectures are easy to understand and he makes the subject interesting good feedback on assignments and if you put the work in you will get a good mark
5.0,M,frank mitchell is to-the-point first day of class he tells you to get an a on the test you just read the chapter you can literally ignore everything he says and read the book and get an a he in an extremely entertaining lecturer even if he gets off track there been a test without extra credit extremely approachable and kind
5.0,M,he is quite literally the best professor at ccc you will learn so much from him because he afraid to tell the truth lectures are long but he is absolutely hilarious great class
5.0,W,i enjoy chef anne she is my favorite teacher her at el centro and i can tell she loves her students as well as baking she is an amazing woman and is willing to experiment new receipts with her students
5.0,M,next to dr mcmonigle probably the best psych professor la salle has to offer i took him for abnormal psych he is so kind i found him funny he gave three or four test and one presentation assignment i got a b in his class i would have received an a if i studied a little harder i strongly encourage taking him if you ever have the chance
4.0,M,professor is super easy so just show up get the midterm and final both are take home and pass with an a he gives one homework assignment due at the end of the semester and it too time consuming
3.5,W,ms yearwood overall a great teacher she can be confusing with dates for assignments and projects but overall she is very knowledgeable about the subject if you just read the chapters you will do fine
3.5,W,she is a really good teacher and you can tell she cares about the students you will have to work for your grade in her class she wants us to succeed but not just going to give you what you earn her lectures are long sometimes they make you want to sleep very informative though
5.0,M,best art professor that i have had i love how each of his assignment taught me something new
5.0,M,inspirational teacher he is there for you if you need help be afraid just ask expects you to try in class and on your assignments do not take his class for granted you will learn to pick out your own mistakes overtime
4.5,M,to be honest not very hard at grading if you do exactly everything he says the main reason why people get and not is because they try to take shortcuts do that here very strict but very easy to get along with outside of class
3.0,M,buy the book from the bookstore do not buy the online code without the book the book is a must easy class gives extra credit basics for excel word access and power point only gave exams throughout the semester lot of times forgets stuff class had to remind him overall an easy class i would recommend him nice teacher
3.5,M,currently taking him his class is the easiest class ever taken not disrespecting him i like to think pretty tech savvy and i like technology but for someone who use word excel access and somewhat hardware i can see them having a tougher time easy a he is a fair grader gives a lot of time for work and tests
3.5,M,i took this class on summer professor is so nice he always helpfulness but he cant give good grade and i dont think is easy about his test i just got grade b on this class that so sad you need buy his book cause have code with that book his all test online
3.0,M,okay professor he teaches at the beginning of class and then you do your own work his tests are online so better buy the code or you would not pass the test is exact as the online work so just review and be okay the only con is that he can be boring but college
5.0,M,there is definitely a lot to learn from him pay attention to all he does his techniques are great
4.5,M,chef chris is wonderful and a must have here at el centro you wont be disappointment with his as an instructor he does get upset if you listen and follow instructions
4.0,M,the class is super easy go to lecture and do the homework and be set he bumps everyone up a huge amount at the end of the year
5.0,M,i took intro stats and although velleman is known for taking the math out of stats the stuff you learn is really useful and applicable to the naturalsocial sciences and super approachable if you study do well when he says taking the math out he just means you have to do rote calculations you think and logic it
5.0,M,great textbook written by him
3.0,M,mr pouncy believes no student deserves an a this is his teaching philosophy his stories are interesting his teaching is good but not good enough to produce students capable of a quality work if you need an a to get into the nursing program or just for the sake of learning how to do high quality work pick another teacher
4.5,M,great i took his class over the summer at moorpark college and kept up with him just fine he gives real-life applications of the material throughout his lectures exams has a traditional teaching style provides book problems for help i did better only going off his notes write your notes neat enough to follow along when you rewrite them
5.0,M,mr ream goes out of his way to help you understand the material and he provides great feedback he has a great sense of humor and is never afraid to admit when wrong he loves statistics and used real life examples which made learning much easier i really enjoyed the semester spring and would most certainly take another of his classes
2.0,M,fred is nice as a person but a terrible teacher his lectures are confusing and top of that he will give you his own notes looks like he used a typewriter and expects you to understand them he is old school and very forgetful i know anyone who is having it easy in this class very stressful and you need to make extra time for this class
2.5,M,he truly is a nice old man and will help you but is very old fashioned he gives out packets for you to learn the material basically on your own but you do corrections which is nice his lectures are basically just examples and can be disorganized he wants you to write steps out but he skips steps himself which causes confusion
2.5,M,i have to strain myself to understand what he is trying to say he speaks so softly and goes off-topic so often that you lose track of where you are in the book he skips sections entirely and gives out multi-page handouts expecting you to understand it lets you do corrections for half credit for the first two quizzes and tests and homework
3.5,M,mr ream wants all of his students to succeed and pass his class very helpful and eager to make sure that students understand his extra credit really helps out if struggling old school and might seem like a mess with all his papers flying around but on top of it highly recommend him for your math class
4.0,M,fred is old school he has corny jokes and uses a pop-up projector but he is an extremely nice teacher i will admit his lectures are dry but he is willing to explain and help students just ask for help he lets you make up half points on quizzes and tests if show up to class you will pass
4.0,M,fred is one of the best math teachers i have taken he is always willing to help i passed this class because of him however make sure you show up to class and miss a test
3.0,M,prof ream is one of the nicest professors out there a little awkward but super patient and willing to help students however his lectures are disorganized and undefined math come easily for me so although a hard worker and i took lots of notes i did have to spend a lot of time in the tutoring center to get a better grasp
1.5,M,i dropped this class dr ream is super nice and kinda a cute old man he tries to make jokes but laugh at them so it just becomes awkward anyway he is very hard to follow im bad at math as it is but i just could not go on in this class his lectures are all over the place some classmates seemed to follow but i just did not
1.0,W,you need to learn to grow up and study on your own ignore the teacher you need to put so much effort in this course you need to do it on your own you need to do so many questions reading from the textbook is not enough she is absolutely useless in class unless u ask her to solve a specific problem in her office is when shed be useful
4.5,W,absolutely love dr gifford she is such a nice and helpful professor i had no problems with her and she explains papers so clearly her essays for only had to pages long she is there to help if needed attendance is a major part of your grade so go to class
5.0,W,dr gifford is one of better teachers she is very approachable and clear there were no tests only a group project which was not so bad there are a couple of reader-response assignments and an page paper at the end of the semester it was a very interesting class and if you have to take it you will not regret taking her class
4.5,M,easy a the difficult part is willing yourself to go to class interesting topics but he makes it boring the papers are challenging as it is impossible to write a perfect paper in pages double spaced while cramming in studies they need to be longer which i cant believe i would want i would not take him again as i found it hard not to skip
2.5,M,this class was the longest class of my life lectures are extremely long he stands in front of a stand and reads the lectures to you the entire time go to the si sessions if they are available i learned everything from the si sessions he gives grades the entire semester midterm and final both you must write during class like a test
4.0,M,teacher way heavy on the mid term and final exam both are strictly essay which was scary at first but he is super fair and an easy learn just have to listen to a lot of lecture
1.5,M,nice guy but long lectures i had him for hours once a week most of the class was gone halfway through class is straight lecture with no powerpoint or visual aid so easy to zone out essay tests worth half your grade so outline and prepare well for those go to si sessions extra credit is offered but ya gotta be there
1.0,M,very droning literally reading straight from a piece of paper a lot of interesting things have happened in history and he touches on none of them
3.5,M,i enjoyed his class and sense of humor total speeches indivual and group mid term and final are tough
5.0,M,great prof hotness irrelevant here to learn and get degree got a b worked hard but found his influence next qtr when had to do a speech in a class i was actually comfortable doing a speech finally thanks to prof betts well worth the time and made it fun great prof kudos to betts for doing a great job and being patient and kind tough
3.5,M,i consider myself a speaker with professional training through the military as a briefer and i received a very high b other students that i felt were weak received and he seems to grade you off of your individual potential instead of grading you off of the other students this will benefit a weak speaker and hurt a charismatic person
4.5,M,as someone who is downright scared of public speaking i found his class to be very welcoming and helpful i learned tons of pointers and figured out how to make my speeches concise and effective professor betts made my four week summer speech course bearable by being a helpful friendly guy he is to-the-point but not harsh great guy
4.0,M,mr betts is really into helping students become all they are capable of a shy person and hate public speaking he realizes this and grades accordingly he let you slip by but grades you low enough to push you to progress i think all it takes to be successful is your own willpower and motivation not being a good speaker
5.0,M,his lecture are really entertaining and obvious he is passionate however if you do the reading yourself class necessary to go to as long as you review all of the vocabulary words the assessments are extremely easy just study highly recommend his class
5.0,M,latin classes here at utah state are amazing professor damen makes you feel like family i imagine my college experience without his intellect and help he truly cares about his students and wants them to succeed if you ever get a chance take his classes they might be difficult but the knowledge you will gain is outstanding
5.0,M,super enthusiastic loves the stuff he teaches i would recommend buying the class reader book in the bookstore--take notes on it in class use it to write papers and study the bold terms for minutes before the test and you will get an a in this class
3.0,W,dr shingle is a very nice woman but not a good teacher in my opinion she is very intelligent so the way she explains the information can be extremely confusing you can ask questions but her answer always clear naturally a strong student so i did well but people who generally strong students struggled in the class
4.0,W,okay she tells you expected and it smart and can come off as talking down to you online quizzes but two tests are taken in class
5.0,M,dr k is awesome he is the best teacher had at depaul he genuinely cares about his students progress and encourages feedback about his teaching and assignments he was a catholic priest but remains unbiased during class discussions participating is actually enjoyable and encouraged take this class
5.0,M,best professor he is an incredible individual and my favorite at depaul take him
5.0,M,dr k is a great professor if you have the opportunity you should take him keeps the class engaged and respects all of his students he teaches you life lessons i think find in any other class at depaul
1.5,W,if you make a low test score she will make an appointment to speak with you but will only go over with what you missed she will not offer no extra work work and if you happen to ask again she will say at this point there is nothing she can do like how messed up is that never will recommend her
5.0,W,she tests more on the than the word definitions but she goes over everything and is pretty fair she uses a high school grading system a b etc and that sucks would have gotten an a if she used a regular grading system but overall good teacher who will work with you if you have to miss a test or something
3.5,M,funny guy really smart if naturally good at math this class be too bad i would avoid skipping as he covers about a section a lecture homework is tough but the quizzes and exams are quite easy
4.5,M,sharp guy expects a lot from his students--sometimes i think he confuses us with his grad students he always work out solutions to the homework problems before he assigns them which can turn into long and grueling homework sessions homework took roughly ten hours a week often more however it was definitely worth being in his class
5.0,W,ms mulcahy is a very good teacher she is willing to help and is very clear in what she expects from each assignment since this is a course you will be doing many different projects throughout the semester so it is in your best interest that you go to class
5.0,W,mrs mulcahy was so easy but the best part is i still learned in this class just do the assigments how she wants have the book and the notes for the online tests come to class and you will have no trouble making an a attendance is huge and just try to understand what asking for on assignments turn in early work great
1.5,M,do not take this class if you have never taken calculus or trig overall had a horrible experience in this course i not learn anything from him i had too go home and learn the material by myself many of the problems on his tests are different from the homework he assigned he is very sarcastic and expects you to already know e
3.0,M,to be honest he is a smart person at math can he teach no it is kind of like einstein teaching a little boy about his own theories only uses the examples not his own you would have to have additional help in order to pass his class the text book wast horrible at explaining things
1.0,M,this guy seriously needs to retire get ready to teach yourself or fail the class he explain anything he expects you to already know how all homework and quizzes are in math-labs the tests are proctored and count percent of your grade do not take
2.0,W,she is a really nice person but her lectures are hard to follow she kinda is all over the place she takes forever to answer emails and is hardly ever physically in her office however she gives lots of partial credit on test which saved me if you dont do the homework or study you wont pass
4.5,W,professor fenton saved my bacon more than once i took her for college algebra math and i mix very well i made a d my first time through b in the maymester course she is a wonderful teacher and always tries to help her students if you have problems you be afraid to speak up she also gives partial credit in maymester course
2.0,W,professor fenton is brilliant her class was very hard for me though i felt like she had a very difficult time getting across what she was teaching she starts a point and then changes it or times before she gets it sorted out in her mind sweet and helpful though
3.0,M,a student have to turn in assignments over and over to get credit for work they have already completed i constantly had to reprint assignments he also asked questions in class that you got points for but write down the right people to receive points may have to take class again bc it hurt my gpa and i am an a student sucks
3.0,M,i had him for psych online i do not recommend taking his class online he is a very smart guy and the class is well organized test open discussion research project and essay questions once or twice a month the test are not that bad with google but the essay questions will hurt your grade big time if you are a lazy take
4.5,W,loved her and her class she really cares if you get it
5.0,W,great class thought her book was great
3.5,W,i was really excited to take this class but it really disappointed the worst thing that happened this semester was the online book she made us buy but then told us not to use it after test and we get a refund this class attendance based but i would really suggest going because the tests are hard
4.5,W,she has experience in the field so she knows what she is talking about and provides good insight has guest speakers attendance not mandatory will do anything to help you if you ask
5.0,W,only grades in the class are exams tests are easy if you take notes and study tests are multiple choice gives a few extra credit points if you go to class she shows several movies and has several guest speakers great class and great professor would absolutely take again attendance not mandatory and textbook not needed
2.0,W,nice lectures are easy in the sense that no participation and we get out of class early a lot she can be confusing though in lectures and rambles we watched a lot of videos and had some guest speakers we really have review sessions for exams and pretty hard she go over exams with you after the test is taken
4.5,W,it is her class so she can say because i said so i think that she is smart and loved the class
2.0,W,i had to dance the nutcracker in front of the whole class if i she was going to take away points we had to take selfies with strangers in public basically we did a ton of stupid stuff that had no relation to psychology she said we need a book then test time comes and she says read your chapters she never taught us anything
1.0,W,i finished her class and i am very disappointed about her class i can say that there is nothing except that reading her confusing lectures watching videos on youtube and doing her tough homeworks be careful to read her long assignments because she is a tough grader and she help you at all
4.5,W,although she is pretty touch for grading but nice and really help you to learn the truth of how programming really is if you are serious about your career as cs engineer so take her i like her commitment in teaching overall very helpful when you come to her office for
1.0,W,assigns a ton of homework said be able to do my work on my mac if i purchased which didnt come with the required software for class her lack of knowledge of current computer software and stubbornness caused me a lot of stress i ended with a getting a c she did not round up even knowing the extra time i put into class
1.0,W,horrible worst class i have ever taken and she is no help at all online for a reason and expects you to come to her office hours for help when you email and show exactly the problem is and just need a better clarification of it all and nothing no help not recommended
1.0,M,awful makes a very difficult subject even more difficult java the easiest subject in the world to learn--and he makes it even more difficult some people are great teachers some are great business people you need to know your strengths care if great in business lousy at teaching a difficult subject that i love java
4.5,M,i took him twice i felt the difficulty of his class was fair the exams were short answer and multiple choice the daily quizzes he gives do help you papare for the exams his grading criteria is clearly laid out if you do the homework you should be able to pass the class with no issuies
1.0,M,take this professor if you have learning differences his learning style work for someone who has learning issues labs vary quizzes are almost daily which is fine but he explain the material in simple terms he makes things complicated than they need to be his voice will make you go to sleep i love compsci
3.0,M,super easy but be ready to sit in class while he rambles about things that have absolutely nothing to do with biology or your lesson
4.0,M,lectures and important facts in seaport are a must read the book very well written but you will need it for some of the tests this class is straight forward weekly quizzes a midterm with essay and a final i highly recommend professor warwick i like his straight forward approach
5.0,M,professor warwick is wonderful he grades fairly and he round your grade at all so expect a higher grade however i guess my case was different because i had an after my final and he just gave me the a even though i expect it he is very attentive to his email and will always respond in a timely manner

4.5,M,dr g does an excellent job of making students feel validated and important to lectures allowed lecture to get derailed from time to time simply because we had a strong interest in a topic and he enjoyed seeing us work with the material great use of examples and ask you for too much you get out what you put into this class
4.0,M,great teacher when it comes to keeping lectures interesting and engaging if you have questions he is easily approachable and will do his best to answer the question
5.0,M,take his soc class i loved going to his classes most days he told stories that made this class great
1.0,W,dr jackson had an extremely arrogant attitude and when asked questions would snap she was not helpful at all and would make snide remarks that made you think twice before even asking a question do whatever you can to avoid this lady
1.5,M,if you want an easy a than take him nothing has anything to do with the course that he goes over all he does is throw temper tantrums about how kean sucks and we watch movies all the time show up to class do other homework he does not care
1.0,M,all he does is talk about how much he hates the administration
3.5,M,i am being very honest and speak with concern he is showing symptoms of senility he forgets things he has said minutes ago kids show up and leave within the first hour last week it was just me and other dude in class left at the end of the lecture i leave because i genuinely feel bad and surprised that he notice
4.5,W,mrs pruett is a great teacher but is extremely un forgiving when grading if you make minor mistakes in grammar or quite write a word structured essay in an hour in class without any preparation or have not so good writing style be prepared to struggle she is really nice and helpful but her class is extremely difficult
4.0,W,professor e is such a sweetheart and will make you think outside the box her class is engaging and a real thought provoker i used to absolutely detest having to take english but she changed the way i feel about the subject you will leave the class with a new and improved sense of analyzing situations and a new sense in creative writing
4.5,M,loved this course prakash does a great job giving the material life through his dedication to getting the information across assignments were fair took some work but they were quite interesting and indicative of what to expect on tests one thingtrusting my interest in the course i barely studied for the final and lost a letter grade for it
5.0,M,amazing prof really cares about his students posts very detailed notes online to make sure everybody understands lectures are entertaining and funny assignments are very interesting exams are fair and the exam material is explicitly laid out beforehand he puts emphasis on the exactness of communications to avoid any ambiguity
4.5,M,what a wonderful professor and wonderful course he clearly tells you exactly what will be on the midtermfinal emphasizes the most important info in class and is a very fun prof he tries his best to learn name too i absolutely loved this class avg midtermfinal grades were high as well
5.0,M,awesome professor he is extremely helpful and clear on what he expects from students need the book all lecture tests are from his power points lab study guides are very direct and helpful he is very understanding and treats students with respect wish he taught micro i recommend his hybrid class for sure
5.0,M,dr mann is a class act he is very approachable clear cut helpful and generous he gives you every opportunity to succeed in a tough course just study his power point notes and audio lectures and really know pathways he is very enjoyable to listen to and has a great sense of humor
5.0,M,dr mann is an amazing professor i had him for he is thorough in his lectures but not too much if you want to learn extra ask and he will tell you as much as like i learned so much in this class as long as you read the powerpoints and pay attention pass this class best professor had
5.0,M,i took his summer i class and just like any other science it was a difficult but i did take the time to study and i passed with an a a great teacher he tells you exactly going to be one the tests i had to write papers but the maximum length was page and a half and if you do miss a class he has all his lectures online
5.0,M,my favorite teacher so far professor mann makes this class enjoyable comfortable funny class is doable as long as you study he is knowledgeable helpful anytime you have a question explain it thoroughly wish he could teach all of my classes i have much respect for him as a teacher and as a person thanks mann will miss it
5.0,M,mr mann is one of the best anatomy teachers at volstate he makes sure that you have all of the material that you need for the tests i will be taking him for anatomy
5.0,M,professor powers is the best teacher i have ever had he loves to teach more than anything and you can tell this because of his enthusiasm and love for chemistry he is an awesome person and does anything to help his students his organic class is hard but it is the best class i have ever taken you will love his teaching
2.0,M,if you want a teacher that actually take him confusing he makes you take tests that he cover better have a photographic memory beware that he does require attendance miss classes and a whole grade is deducted you better be an energetic speaker or screwed
2.5,M,i took his night class that was held on mondays it was a good class he actually teach however i did not mind that at all in fact much of his class was straight to the point you hear a small number of speakers watch some movies take quizzes and final exam plus you do a speech almost every week skip class
3.5,W,i hardly ever went to class and still made an a she kind of makes you feel stupid when asking a question but she will answer it she really knows her stuff and is very good at explaining things i like math and i really did enjoy her class the few times that i went
4.5,W,one of her creative writing students i love roberta smart funny and sweet and understanding not in love with the class always not her fault the class the talent level varies wildly and i feel like we focus on the poor writers significantly more like a higher level of talent in the class
4.5,W,there are essays you have to do throughout the semester a few grammar tests classes finish early woohoo she helps a lot during the process of writing the essay just make sure you use her help in editing your drafts and what not not a tough grader but you need to submit all essays grading is also very clear
3.0,W,i actually would take her again because personally enjoyed writing her papers taken her for engl and currently engl your grade is based on five essays and you skip one at all the topics were easy so writing the papers were a cakewalk instructions for essays were straightforward basically just do all of your work
2.5,M,he is a nice person and i have found him to be more helpful in one-on-one situations the lectures are not particularly helpful since you are expected to do the bulk of your learning in studio
1.0,M,terrible lecturer disorganized the physics department is terrible and he is apart of this mess never know what doing and their terrible explanations help at all good luck also they have no official textbook so good luck finding what you need to know
1.5,W,she was very rude and i would not recommend her i had to switch out of her class
5.0,M,dr bob is such a great teacher yes his lectures are long and his reading assignments are very very very very long but in the end it is all so worth it make sure you know how to take good and efficient notes be that one student who looks lost during lectures i would take his class over and over again if i could just do it
5.0,M,more of a stand and talk kind of guy his handwriting can get a bit messy to read however his lectures are pretty amazing dr classes are definitely great to take although he does make a huge deal about independent reading and answering questions he incorporates his lectures with the reading show up read take notes and pass
4.5,W,just do all of the required readings and attend lecture she is essentially the study guide for the exams pay attention she also gives actual study guides that help refresh your memory if you review you have much trouble for the multiple-choice exams participation matters during the discussion period there are also two page essays
4.5,W,super inspirational loved this class though she tends to ramble on about the same things for the first half hour of every class midterm and final are both multiple choice questions and are easy if you do the reading do the reading a lot though the way the questions are structured too hard to guess page papers
4.0,W,i took her minority and stratification she is a very sweet lady it is hard to understand her because she talk so low you must read your chapters to pass her test it is not an easy a if what you looking for overall i enjoyed her class especially minority groups
5.0,W,for me she is introverted professor but she is very warm hearted so far i really like to go in her class because i study she explains well and the works are always done on time her teaching skill is professional she knows what students need to pass this course participate in class ask to clear sth u dont know and kill the quizes and exam
5.0,W,one of the nicest teachers i have had she uses ppt in class and makes everything very clear class is a bit boring but come on it is accounting she is always willing to help and spend time with students have questions very patient if you could i would definitely suggest to take her class
5.0,W,i like this professor she is clear in the class and willing to help students who do not understand itself is a hard course you need to pay attention if you show up every time and ask questions you will get an a
5.0,W,amazing professor that she explain very well and spend whole class time that mean she want to waste any minute
2.0,W,never take her class never
3.5,W,her classes can kinda drag on but nice and very helpful if you understand something if you do the homework the class is easy and honestly attendance will not be necessary she takes classes for each chapter which necessary tbh but i would take her again
4.5,W,if you ask her for help very helpful
5.0,W,this is a great teacher thorough helpful very punctual she always got back to me to help even on the due dates which were on sundays she made videos about my work personally to help me really understand love her and wish i could take the nest class with her do the work and you will get good grades book absolutely necessary
5.0,W,cindy herbert is a wonderful instructor very concise and clear about the curriculum if you show up and stay the entire class you rewarded with attendance fair warning i would definitely take her again
4.0,M,fonseca is a fun teacher but his class can go either way it is very easy to slack off in that class as there is little hw and attendance is optional posts lectures online he is from costa rica so he has an accent if you go to class and stay on top of the material you should be fine slack off and you will regret it
5.0,M,he is just a lovely person excellent one-on-one so take advantage of office hours soft-spoken so you have to really listen but his lectures are always incredibly thorough and interesting he also seems genuinely interested in what students have to say his laugh is also the most adorable sound heard out of a grown man highly recommend him
4.0,M,make sure you either do the readings and look over powerpoint slides or attend every class you have to do both a very straightforward course with a midterm exam final paper and final exam if you plan on attending the classes be sure you sit close to him because is very very quiet
5.0,M,best pick for supervisor provides detailed feedback very respected and insightful lectures get long and tedious but he provides you with all the info you need for essays read the material for multiple choice not just slides sweetest prof on st pats often given the street name obrizzle because he is our homeboy we love him
4.0,M,really into musical films and gives very clear lectures but he can be rather repetitive and drag on subjects also he is incredibly soft-spoken sometimes you hear him over the central heating he uploads lecture slides and assigns readings study all that and you barely have to come in for class
5.0,M,hes an overall great guy passion for films is evidently conveyed through lectures and comments he has helped me become more critical in my analyzing of films and has created my love for french new wave cinema
1.5,M,he really loves film but he makes you hate it he can talk forever and he can really put you to sleep for anyone who loves to sleep i recommend this class
5.0,W,tracy is awesome if you have the chance to take one of her classes you should i also felt like i understood the content of the class and ended the course more knowledgeable she doesnt make class stressful and she wants you to do well tracy is a good role model
4.0,W,she is an amazing professor she is passionate about her field she loves her students she is always available to talk in her office
4.0,W,she is an amazing professor she is passionate about her field she loves her students
5.0,M,i have had few classes with dr aabdullah after first class i took with him i was looking for classes he was taking in next semester so that i can avail them very helpful and has clarity in teaching would go extra mile to explain something if students are not following
5.0,W,professor zeigler is dope i took her environmental science and lab class at gpc clarkston and her class is cool lectures are power point-based and quizzes are based on those power points research paper which hard at all easy class and cool teacher overall
5.0,W,great professor tells you to the smallest detail what she expects in her papers as long as you try you will get a good grade
1.0,W,it is almost finals week we have two tests for grades and we had to go visit a museum on student study day btw she cancelled the trip to the museum at in the morning and then told us to go anyway for a grade no real office hours just catch her there is no you must participate in the class discussions she uses the word stupid alot
2.5,W,overall the best i can say is i hate dr carnes she liked me which is a good thing because her grading choices are incfluenced by her opinion also the current department chair so it is essential to get into her good favor
5.0,W,great professor class is really discussion based so if that is not your cup of tea take her if you go to her office she will give you help with anything also study guides are exactly like the test do them and you will at least get a b on the test
2.0,W,i had been taking notes in lecture and out of the book studied prior to the midterm and the questions were nothing like i had expected luckily the group project and final bumped my grade she let the class vote on the final we chose an essay she told us the prompt beforehand felt that my grade did not reflect my effort or knowledge of subject
4.0,W,i liked her long lectures but posted the class notes to elearning lots of subject related movie day classes two independent papers one group paper which i did alone member dropped class other do any work so dr salter told me to do it on my own test hard is essay written in class given in advance
5.0,M,great guy great class the schedule said this class met times a week but he made it to only twice a week baker made class enjoyable even though it was a definitely an easy a
4.0,M,great teacher he cares so much about his students you can tell he has a true passion for aerospace and mechanics the tests are extremely easy they take about minutes to finish he assigns group projects every month attend class
3.5,M,dr midkiff is a really knowledgeable and helpful teacher he is always available for help and responds quickly to emails usually copying the whole class so that no one is confused he gives a few attendance quizzes if he starts to see a decrease in attendance overall very respected and really knows his stuff would definitely recommend
5.0,M,dr midkiff is a phenomenal teacher and a really nice person considering how difficult thermodynamics is he makes it very understandable he includes tons of practical application examples in his lectures that make them engaging great sense of humor too i highly suggest him for any thermo course at this school
5.0,M,his hands-on experience in industry helps him to be able to explain course topics in a way which is easy to understand
5.0,M,clear straightforward understandable teaches all necessary material well and prepares you for tests hand-written short homework daily i would suggest doing them for practice gives a couple tests but they are short and fair and he tells you what type of problems will be on them i would definitely recommend dr haque
3.5,M,haque is an exceptional professor his communication is shaky at times but get used to it test questions are very similar to the homework he gives a couple good examples in lecture but usually gets rushed toward the end of class if you pay attention in class and do the homework not too bad
5.0,M,i enjoyed sharif as he was great at communicating explains hard conceptsproofs for those who are more interested but require too much on tests i highly recommend going to lecture and taking good notes and trying out the hw hw is good practice for tests but is small part of grade gives good reviews for tests and allows formula sheets
4.0,M,i loved this class dr sharif has an accent which takes a few days to get used to but he has an amazing teaching style the majority of lecture is him working out problems by hand before each test he does a review of questions which are extremely similar to the actual test questions he gives tons of partial credit and always wants to help
1.0,M,if you are bad at math just do not take his class at all he is a nice guy tries to be funny and joke around but as a professor he is just horrible he cannot speak english properly he knows math just cant explain it he does not like confrontation either if you talk to him about something he will take it personal and make your life hell
5.0,M,you will learn a lot from his class
4.5,M,helpful helpful helpful this is the guy you want if you are fearing math i was dreading math but hu tells you on day that he has study sessions saved my tail it mean easy college math not supposed to be but in the study sessions he works with you til you get it and very funny too he makes class enjoyable
3.5,M,this class was really difficult i found a lot of his lectures hard to comprehend because he really go in depth with step by step concise directions a nice guy but i think this class is better suited for someone that already knows a bit about statistics or is generally very good at math
5.0,M,one of the best math teachers he assigns homework but it is similar to what will be on the test he sets you up for success in his class he may have a thick accent but he writes everything on the board so you have no reason not to understand he made coming to class enjoyable with his sense of humor and funny personality
4.5,M,i was not interested in history however professor stern was a really great teacher and kept your attention i will definitely take one of his classes again
1.0,W,simple do not take her she never replies to emails very snappy in group chat if you ask a question she also gives low grades on assignments and it is a requirement to watch movies in the library even though an online class she grades work late and gives a ton of work and only a class everyone in my class failed
1.0,W,the worst professor ive ever had she isnt clear on her outlines she wants certain material on the outlines but gives you such a broad topic at office hours she will give you a lecture of what doing wrong but will not tell you how to better your work and off topic percent of the time she also treats you like grade school students
2.5,W,i dont like history classes but i did like that she is very understanding and passionate for what she lectures students who take this course think that you need to know a lot about aas but this is a beginners course which she does remind us multiple times throughout the semester that she does not expect us to be experts on the subject
1.5,W,online met about times throughout the semester you must attend and be there the whole class time or she will mark you down the book i highly used in the course all your assignments are assigned from the book was not clear with instructions groups were horrible new groups each week which she assigned final and midterm paper homework
5.0,W,this class covers topics in detail and the professor is very helpful and knowledgeable participate get involved do the work and do well in the class professor is very understanding of students this is a level class expected to perform at a high standard she gives good feedback too just dedicate yourself and be fine
1.0,W,i took aas last fall with the hope that it will be worth it it she was so unclear about so many things and there was even an instance when she told us what she wanted in our paper on the day it was due she also throws occasionally insensitive comments out there so watch out did i learn yes but not from her
4.0,M,heywood is a great guy he is full of knowledge and his passionate about the subjects that he teaches all of his test and quizzes you can do by yourself or in groups on your own time outside of class he gives you them a week ahead of time so you have to cram for anything he tape records all his lectures and powerpoints and puts them on
1.5,M,i would never take a class with him again he was a nice enough guy and gave us many opportunities to get a good grade however his were very hard and very stressful i felt as if going to class was pointless because the questions on were nothing like what he talked about in class absolutely infuriating
5.0,M,environmental hazards is a great class should be renamed to search and rescue dr heywood brings alot of experience to the class from his navy days he is a great person to talk to and to get to know but be warned hes a talker for sure
5.0,M,i had olguin before for political science and loved his class his classes are entertaining and very easy but the fact that he gets students involved and to actually think outside of the box is what gets our mind rolling i like that he finds interesting ways to engage the students in projects lectures and different perspectives of the mind
3.0,M,take him for ps he says f word a lot but everyone likes it his lectures are inspirational never get bored listen to him he assumes that students know everything about the us government and he expects you to know a lot i know a thing so ended up dropping the class but definitely come back for those great lectures when im ready
1.5,M,i actually liked him until the end of quarter he post the grades for any extra credits and even the final therefore i had no clue of how i got a grade lower than what i expected when i asked him politely about that after the quarter ended he was being very careless at answering my questions i will never in my life take his class again
3.5,M,tjaden is extremely smart and really knows his stuff but this class is hard there is a ton of individual work to be done his lectures are helpful but google honestly helped me way more than his lectures
2.0,W,i definitely would not recommend taking her class she is a nice woman but not the best teacher she teaches the easy things pretty well but when it comes to the confusing stuff she speeds right through it she gives out way too much homework online and worksheets and accept any excuses she is also very stingy about grading
5.0,W,mrs lair is the best math teacher i have ever had she is very organized with her lecture notes and explains things very clearly she is willing to help whenever a student asks a question however you must be prepared for the class if you know the prerequisite material for the course you are in big trouble be responsible
5.0,M,i took professor internship seminar after taking his intro to media industries a few semesters ago absolutely nothing bad to say about the experience with this class the discussion board assignments we had were like journaling and he has a genuine interest in how students will take their careers take him you regret it
3.5,M,professor rose gives a lot of homework and reading it is a lot to keep track of but he does send out helpful emails keeping you up to date the workload is worth it because the lectures are very interesting and the topics usually are as well beyond that prof rose is just a pleasant professor to have and his passion is contagious
4.5,M,although the workload was intense and there was a ton of reading i hesitate to take him again this man responds to emails instantaneously and you are able to get help in an instant the assignments he gives for outside of class are very fun as well his lectures are interesting but take good notes great professor
4.0,W,i love geo and i think this was an amazing class she posts the notes online but go to class will sometimes have clicker questions for attendance the lab is easy and the tests are long but easy i would recommend her and this class
4.5,M,fantastic professor loved his teaching took documentary survey from him he opened my eyes to the art of docs which i understand before the class he makes you write so be prepared for probably decent length papers he will grade semi-tough but worth it some of the docs the most interesting but are valuable nonetheless
5.0,W,all in all a great professor while her tests can get rather hard she gives bonus points to make up for it and even once gave us bonus points on a point test there are only three tests and a final if you work hard and put in the effort you will easily get an a she is willing to help you the only way to fail her class is to be lazy
4.5,W,she tries her hardest to get every student an a she gives bonus points we had a curve one time there are only test including the final if you read the book take notes in class and go to her office hours get a high a and i mean like or she is always asking if we understand things and stops for questions every
5.0,W,i never met a teacher that truly cares for their students as much as her she is always asking for feedback on how she is teaching and if she needs to go over something again she teachers better than any teacher at truman and she knows what she is talking about people fail because they put in the work and tell her when they need help
1.0,W,dare-halma for cs is like shooting yourself in the foot if you a take a cs class in highschool that went over basic things b make most of your time for the class her grading is very harsh as your tests have a test review guide in which you must know everything if it correlates with anything its on there bad for beginners
1.0,W,this was the worst her programs are long and the homework had no clarity at all from the textbook and her graders had to grade them without the answer key and grade a week after they are turned in along with getting the answer key her tests were long coding part she expects you to read alot from the book but goes out of order
1.0,W,her programs take way too long including the tests her test questions take way too long even if you go to her office hours and go over the test she goes fast and help a lot hw assignments were dumb because she has specific answers to them and her tutors grade them without the answer key
4.5,W,professor usyk is great i had her for cells and molecules lab at stockton very relaxed in lab and makes class fun i would take her for lecture if i could she explains the intros very clearly and teaching is so natural for her tests seem hard but you have to put in the effort and study everything if you know the material be fine
2.5,W,i did not like her as a professor she was terribly boring and moved way too fast i was too busy writing her notes that i did not have time to process what she was saying i can honestly say i felt sad when i knew i was going to her class
1.0,W,i took professor usyk as my lab professor at stockton college and she was horrible she care about her students teach in class or help with labs she gives really tough quizzes and give you a grade until after the semester is over do not take her whatever you do
5.0,M,taken both dr baers education psychology and online creativity courses education psychology is fairly hard but the online creativity course was easy very light homework and no tests a nice man who cares about his students and what teaching talks a little fast sometimes
3.5,M,professor baer is a great teacher he enjoys lectures and tends to mumble or speak fast but always makes sure that you understand before moving on he enjoys teamwork and has teams work for points tests are all multiple choice but they are not super easy you definitely need to review notes before tests i would absolutely take him again
3.5,M,loved professor baer lectures were a little boring but always tried to make it interesting and hands-on by including small group-work gives lot of hand outs and you do not need to read all of them tests are difficult use quizlet and books to your advantage i would definitely take him again
4.0,W,go to class at the end of the semester she told us she reserved the right to drop you a letter grade for skipping class
4.0,M,take this professor if you get the chance this course is an easy a and at the same time you really learn a lot this professor teaches in a way of his own and it is a course that i will never forget i drove from pensacola beach to milton just to take this class and it was worth every mile professor wolf loves his job and it shows
4.0,M,took chuck for my and a winter course to finland he is an awesome professor grades fairly and cancels class often if you get the chance take the crime and justice in scandinavia with him you will love it
2.0,M,seems to understand what he is doing but is easily the worst teacher had at communicating what he is talking about to students his lack of proficiency in english can be a challenge at times although accent is clear can be incredibly rude at times calling out students for not knowing answers
4.0,W,okay so all being way too hard on her yeah she assigns a lot of reading but this is college supposed to be learning not getting grades for nothing she has intriguing class discussions grades fairly gives helpful feedback and she really knows her stuff
3.5,M,cuevas taught me how to write a college paper he was great with feedback very funny and really able to relate to the students he gives you a chance to revise your worst paper and earn points back very fair grader and really wants his students to do well would definitely recommend
3.5,M,i have him for calculus iii he would give extra points on any tests and expected hw every monday his accent will get better when you are used to it and try to sit at the front very lenient on partial credits he is quite funny sometime
3.5,M,had for calculus iii sometimes can be difficult to understand but if you sit towards the front you should get it if i saw his name listed for another math course i would take him again in a heartbeat
3.0,M,super nice guy who makes calc much easier the webassign homework is disproportionately harder than the exams--if you can do the homework the exams will be a breeze but they too bad anyway go to class review his lecture slides on blackboard do the homework and know the study guides well and you will make an a would recommend
3.5,M,very sweet man if the type of person who needs their prof to explain everything in me your guy gives old tests to study for your exam takes attendance and if you miss more than two days you can replace your lowest test score with your final accent is not bad but you may want to sit close to him bc he speaks softly
3.0,M,he is a good teacher and the tests are pretty easy because he gives you old exams to study there is a good amount of homework online and he takes attendance everyday he does have an accent but you get used to it and he writes everything he says in the online notes he gives you and on the board in class
3.5,M,i really liked professor liem always happy and cracked me up during class his tests too easy but he puts very aggressive curves on all the tests the class ended up being easier than i expected
5.0,M,professor jochim is amazing one of the best professors i had in my life passionate understanding and such a wonderful professor take him if you can
3.0,M,this was the most boring lecture and i eventually stopped attending if you show up for the lab portion and do the online homework on your own you should get an easy a this was a very easy class but required a lot of time doing online work i think jerry was a very smart prof but he had a hard time dumbing it down to our level
4.0,M,deviant behavior was the best class taken at assumption the class is very easy for the most part because you are studying how people defy norms in society lectures are awesome best had he gives examples with the notes which are essential for your in class essays overall amazing professor and great class
4.5,M,professor gendron is probably the best professor at assumption college he gives you the honest truth and actually talks about stuff that is relevant to society his lectures are extremely interesting and he is more than helpful during his office hours but be on your cellphone during class
3.0,M,ah dr rorke the gatekeeper and decider for all things whp although he can be intimidating and expect a lot of students he is overall consistently clear on expectations as long as you know where to look new students heed warning and check all syllabi posted on the whp section of the oakland website the answers are there just read
2.0,M,the thing you are going to absolutely hate him for the entirety of his class you are going to be bored from his rambling irritated at his disrespect frustrated at his teaching methods however at the end of the day he is going to make you a better writer if you listen to him pay heed to his criticisms the pain was worth it
5.0,W,engl was by far my favorite of my first semester in college professor mach provides her students with everything they need to know in order to be successful in her class she is always there for her students has a very clear grading criteria and is an overall exceptional professor she has the best attitude seen in a teacher amazing
4.0,M,professor catalano is a cool dude really enjoyed his class attendance is mandatory if you want to pass tests are rather tough but he offered huge extra credit at the end of the semester oh and you need to buy his textbook about bucks i believe he said he curves final grades if needed he really wants you to do well
5.0,M,his class is very entertaining and is easy his classwork and homeworks are easy and he quiz you he also tells you whats going to be on the test which is awesome but theres alot he makes you write about three essays for each tests and there are also true false questions
2.5,M,he takes this class way to serious to the point where obnoxious it be that hard for a class exams are all based on lectures and he give any slides notes are all vocal do not take if other possibilities
4.0,M,sets of essays a few reading quizes can chose to not write final paper i wrote the final paper and he bumped me up from a b to an a go to office hours and get him to read over your papers no tests super funny
4.0,M,although he is a tough grader everything you need is provided either go off of his powerpoints for papers or go in for help he is one of the most accommodating professors for those who go in to ask for help or with questions i bombed a paper but was able to learn from it and got nothing but or higher for the rest of the semester
4.5,M,jay ko cuts through pompous textbook explanations and teaches the essential knowledge he will not pamper you though and i think that made a lot of people drop the section i will take him again for calc
4.5,M,jay ko will not pamper you he will teach you to destroy math though i will be taking him for calc
3.5,M,i personally do not care for this professor because of his teaching style he only gives grades on quizzes and exams so if you do well on those then you really redeem yourself his homework required to turn in but recommended for practice he is a very tough grader
4.0,M,i had this professor for my stats class in all honesty i struggled a bit but with a lot of studying outside of class i managed to pull an a thank god he was a kind teacher who did care for my grade and if you put in the extra effort will reward you greatly he gave lots of opportunities to better test scores
1.5,M,he is very picky about his papers and if you have one thing wrong in mla style he will take alot of points off good luck i finished with a b but it was hard to get the b
2.0,M,terrible teacher at least online completely unwilling to actually help anytime you ask for help he just refers you back to his online content and accuses you of not doing any of your assigned reading i tried to meet with him at his office and he basically told me no his feedback was clear when asking for help rude and disrespectful
4.5,M,very specific on his grading material and really goes into depth on what should be included in your papers to make page count and write good content very approachable and has a lively attitude loves his job only down side is he critique papers at all if already a good writer easy class and great prof overall
2.5,M,this class was tough i pulled numerous all-nighters to be able to pass but he did help me become a much better writer for the future and with taking i have to take anymore english classes on my final i thought i did really good but he marked me down and till this day i know why
4.0,M,pretty clear class he wants what he wants but gives you feedback on drafts in class and spends a lot of times making sure you understand stuff
4.0,M,get ready to step outside your comfort zone and open your mind to learn new ways of seeing things he allows you to test out ideas and theories through writing if you are a good writer on top of that you will ace the class and enjoy it immensely however the minute you close your mind is the minute you have set yourself up to fail this class
1.0,M,there are only actual assignments and then participation points so if you do well on a few things you are really screwed i never knew what he really wanted from me because his feedback is awful when you submit your rough drafts slow to respond to emails and when he does he answer half your questions anyways
4.0,M,thom is a very interesting guy be prepared for that most of all his subjects in my opinion are a little dated but they are pretty easy to write about a tough grader but if you know how to write this class will be a breeze just be prepared to work at it
3.0,M,a lot of effort is needed to pass his class
3.5,M,this was an online section and some complained that the site was hard to follow i think they read the stuff if you do and really pay attention you can do fine he wants what he wants give it to him
4.5,M,he fine tunes your stuff no big revelations about writing except it takes time and lots of drafts to come up with good stuff very reasonalbe in research component funny guy
4.0,M,thom wants what he wants and is fair and resonable he allows you to write on any topic so some of the peer stuff is interesting but cool to have that freedom good input
3.5,M,classes are very old-fashioned but he still seems to spark my interest just read his chapter before class you will totally get his referenced witty jokes
2.5,M,easy teacher give any homework or any tests only gave one because he had to he said even read your answer on the test if its long he says even pay attention if you show up to class talks and rambles the whole time but easy
2.5,M,clearly very intelligent but the bar is set far too high for an intro-level class the use of the online practice modules feels like tacked-on busy work to fill time papers come with unrealistic expectations and without discussion about due dates that he said we would discuss in the future would not recommend especially for new students
3.5,M,chaney is super cool took him for intro to screenwriting relatable and understands his students really good with feedback on your scripts sometimes he can get distracted easily and it can be annoying but his distractions make class interesting would totally take him again
5.0,M,probably my favorite professor at scad he knows what he is talking about and is very helpful and is great with his critiques he tells lots of stories sometimes relevant sometimes not i would definitely take his class again
5.0,M,if youre thinking of taking gutliph do it for an online class he is extremely helpful and interacts with his students he grades fairly overload with too much homework and prepares for tests he is super helpful and has good taste in music as well which makes him all the more awesome take him you will not regret it one bit
3.0,M,math or discrete math is not an easy class and it is much harder online dr gutliph was the first to put this class online and i struggled until the end i suppose the course will get refined and better but it is so not an easy a my class found plenty of online videos i am sure he will share with the next classes overall he is a fair grader
4.5,M,lectures are long but he is so passionate about his subject dr haynie is such a kind person and he loves what he does test are easy and he will give you extra credit if you miss any class
3.0,M,he rambles endlessly and gives lectures from memory he well prepared for every class although he obviously knowns what he is talking about it comes across disjointed and is impossible to take notes from just drill the book and teach your self supplements save lives
4.5,M,he is a great professor he loves to sit down and meet with you one on one and is willing to help at any time
4.5,M,he tells you exactly how to get an a you have to work for it but if willing right there he is always willing to talk to you make accommodations and really goes out of his way to help a student who asks for it he says any version of the text book is fine but make sure you get the old version
5.0,M,dr rahimzadeh is such a great professor lectures are always interesting but do not miss them because on the test and he is hilarious i think anyone could make early lit fun but he does two pg papers and one pg paper and a little picky but helpful if you take good notes and read the stories do fine
5.0,M,amazing professor definitely made my shakespeare course amazing he was very clear in lectures and what he expected for exams he try to trip you up and has a genuine desire for you to succeed tests are not cumulative also a funny and engaging speaker you will hear lots of great stories definitely recommend
3.5,M,professor masten was excellent this semester he will work with you and has the grades posted quickly
1.5,M,william masten is not a professor ever recommend lectures are very scattered the only benefit is that all the information you need to pass is in the power points and book expect to gain much from him personally
5.0,M,i loved this class mr dinneen knows his stuff and presents it in a way that actually makes it interesting his tests are not easy but he gives several opportunities for extra credit towards the end of the semester i really feel like i learned and retained a lot of information in this class show up take good notes and be fine
4.5,M,i took his week online course and for anyone who is considering taking it be ready to read answer questions in clear detail and sit down and really work on the course for at least hours at a time if you really put in the effort easily pass plus a great professor and pretty funny too
5.0,M,i took this class online there is a lot of reading from the textbook and powerpoint lectures tests are in the form of essays and you have to know your stuff to get a good grade he gives detailed feedback which is helpful and offers weekly extra credit this class is not an easy a but he is a good professor and i learned a ton
4.0,M,for the first test i was furious i studied hard read all assignments got barely c i found what he is looking for i got a pay attention what he said this will be in test or on the test i want you to draw the diagram he said those when students having hot debate i did all the extra credits questions be prepared be creative
2.0,M,hard to understand with his accent lectures were tough i passed with a b even with his review sheets really nice guy though just not recommended unless you know math
4.0,M,dr holcomb is one of the greatest educators i have had since coming to eku i had no idea that health education could be so interesting dr holcomb is so inspiring as he lectures and the material is easy lots o f class discussions which helps you learn a lot about other cultures an easy a students gets all info needed to pass this class
4.0,M,a good teacher and is really cool he is hilarious and class is normally fun
1.0,M,this class seemed like a blow off class there are barely any grades we had like assignments a midterm and a presentation attendance is what he grades on but only of the grade the midterm was outrageous and pretty sure the average curve was the only teacher for this class unfortunately nice guy though
4.5,W,really nice and gives really good feedback if you ask questions she assigns a considerable amount of homework but manageable but the essays assigned in the course are a little tough so make sure you do them and put effort into it overall good professor
4.5,W,incredible lecturer who demystifies and brings infectious excitement to phenomenology which to newbies is incredibly dense dry and intimidating was frustrated and confused for every reading but in class she made it totally engrossing is very friendly one on one very helpful if u contact her even about doing poorly or missing deadlines
2.0,M,xenophobic self-centred proud of himself whereas considered by his peers as a martian who is more interested by his glory than the success of his students
1.5,W,professor iten managed to make me dread bio lab every single week and she was barely in the room during lab she wrote the lab manual which made simple concepts overly-complicated and lab procedures convoluted they grade the lab on accuracy rather than effort even though the point of the course is to gain familiarity with lab overall awful
5.0,W,best professor i have ever had if had a chance please take a class with her
1.0,W,dr iten loves to complicate everything she also loves to waste time on clicker questions in order to get done on time read the manual and do all calculations before going to lab understand exactly what be doing in lab to also make it easier look at the sample in-lab problems because they are the exact same
1.0,M,this man should not be a professor he is a kind man but this man does not teach or provide material to learn from he is a horrendous professor and should not be employed as a professional teacher i have learned absolutely nothing from him and im so angry i spent my money on his class of toenails could teach me more than he ever has
5.0,M,be sure to see him in his office hours if you want to do well fortunately he seemed to have more office hours then the rest of my professors combined papers take about hours to write and about the same amount of time to edit
3.5,M,very funny personality talks like he care but as he more excited he sounds more angry which makes learning programming really funny if you are new to programming take his class if you already know how to program take his class because if you finish the assignments you get guaranteed rest is the tests
2.0,M,this class overall has an incredibly high fail rate this teacher however make it any easier his lectures are confusing and give any chances for a retake or even to earn lost marks if you fail one quiz or one lab just drop the course and waste your time you need a on every piece of assignment to pass
4.0,M,dr osland is a fantastic guy and an intelligent professor nice as could be and i really enjoyed his lectures most of them were interactive with the class so that helped to keep things interesting but he was somewhat weird when it came to grading basically on all assignments and tests he took off a couple points and i totally sure why
3.5,M,hard grader on tests and really give reasons for grades most of the time especially on tests other than that he is a solid teacher and would recommend him if you are trying to play it safe
1.0,W,she is terrible just the worst teacher ever i have had a few mediocre teachers in my life but i have never actually had a bad teacher and she was just awful she does not know the material she was teaching and one of the students basically taught our class because dr v got so much wrong do not take her class
4.0,M,i really liked him he is intelligent funny and clear if taking him for logic in practice you need the book you pass without it the class is entirely based it he conducts lectures through student participation he is a bit of a tough grader but you have a hard time as long as you pay attention and know the material
1.5,M,one of the worst professors at the university of alabama the only reason people take his class is because it is required for the gis certificate he cares very little about you and the class it is a shame that he has been allowed to get this far at the university of alabama the class is just power points and you have to teach yourself
4.0,M,first off dr snider is hilarious he adds humor to the chemistry which makes it a lot more bareable the only complaint is that he grades formal labs extremely hard almost impossible to get an a luckily the other assignments will boost your grade and he was always willing to answer questions inside outside of class
3.5,M,dr snider is a good professor his lectures are interesting informative and got a good funny personality just expect an easy a you have to put a lot of effort into the class and the tests are very challenging for a core class
5.0,M,pin-cushioning proportioning and lowballing if you do any of these things will be ran over by a man with a pipe full of cherry tobacco wearing a authentic scottish bagpipers hat plus he will take your house too obviously live fast or die is a good mindset going in but never find a better teacher to prepare you for the real world
3.5,M,prof shangraw will come at you like a raging hawk in the very beginning of each semester worry he gets better as you get through the program and will eventually be a nice guy to know and learn from he is very smart and loves bluf bottom line up front and will tell you exactly what he wants for each assignment
1.0,W,unrealistic expectations that this class takes up all a students time she does not give clear explanations and gets mad at the students for questioning her she let you finish writing the of long drawn out sentences on her slides so get ready and learn how to write short hand notes if you take this class she provides no resources
1.0,W,this is the worst professor at bu she provides a disrespectful learning environment and is a bad teacher do not take this class with this professor most people do very poor take this class with another professor
1.0,W,worst prof ever had rarely follows the text ridiculous test grading scheme marks per point on mark short answer questions uses definitions from the making modern definitions wrong in her eyes rude and unclear in explanations talks quickly need a laptop since notes be in text if you need her dont take her
2.5,W,dr edguer was extremely kind toward all her students however i found that she had a lot of tough material on biological terms and info in psychology courses even though biology is not a prerequisite if you do take a class with her you will have to study really hard but she treats all students with respect and is always open for questions
3.0,W,i took her abnormal psych class first then intro to bio psych she is a very nice person and genuinely cares abut her students honestly taking her classes taught me how to study better basically study everything especially test notes i only used textbook for clarification if she cover something in class work hard procrastinate
4.0,M,this teacher is amazing best math teacher in the whole department you will never regret taking his math class i am terrible at math but he is helpful and makes his goal to make his students pass he is like a friend
2.0,M,peter is knowledgeable my problem with him is he is straight up rude ucr should be more careful about hiring ill-mannered professors like peter chung and long gao
4.5,M,professor chung is one of my favorite finance professor he knows his stuff inside out and very clear in explaining concepts with real world example i know why others are saying his is difficult compared to others his exams are not multiple choice but not easy to get an a the best thing is he curves the class by a lot
4.5,M,took two finance classes bus and bus with professor chung his midterms are fairly easy compared to final exam like most of the classes he gives you study reviews before every exam and you are pretty much guaranteed b given that you studied all those as long as you know his lectures hw set a and study review getting a is not difficult
3.5,M,smart guy tells you what to study so going into his exams too difficult given the assumption you actually studied the median is set at b so passing this class too hard overall the class is good but chung himself can be a bit insensitive although it take away from his overall knowledge
5.0,M,todd is a great prof and film can be a difficult concept but he is able to put it in simple terms for new students his quizzes are based of the film lecture and readings so as long as you attend class and screenings you should do well the exams are straightforward and everything you need to know is on the study guide super sarcastic too
5.0,M,ask him a question always answer he explains complex theories in ways you can understand understanding if turn something in on time hilarious and the best
4.0,M,dr arrey is a great professor and one of the best i have ever taken his class is definitely tough but as long as you work pretty hard and go talk to him in his office when you have questions you get anything less than a b
1.5,M,very hard to understand what he wants the material is very difficult but if you get on his good side he can be an enjoyable guy
2.0,M,i stopped liking chemistry because of this professor he would not hear comments and will try by all means to not give points back even if it was his mistake
5.0,W,amazing she genuinely cares if you do well provides excellent feedback and as long as your putting in the work she will work with you never seen someone care as much as her and especially in a course with very challenging content down to earth easy going and very brilliant wish she taught all my courses
4.5,W,very straight forward blunt at times but its strategic and she truly is a remarkable prof and genuine person
1.5,W,she will give out homework but she never picks it up she will also tell us to not be scared to ask her questions but when you ask her questions she will explode and no answer your question
3.5,M,i absolutely loved him he made his lectures interesting and i actually looked forward to going to class he made a booklet of all the study guides and lecture outlines for us to take notes on all you had to do was go to copyworks and buy it there were a few videos but mostly lecture information was on tests
3.5,M,a nice guy but very boring lectures i have zoned out so many times tests are pretty tough he does give you a study guide though lecture every class quizzes on short books and tests over a few weeks of material
4.0,M,dr peters does a great job keeping his political affiliation out of his lectures his class is not easy but he is a really nice guy and helps you succeed all his exams are online of them and there is a cumulative in class final based off previous exam the online exams are tough but it is not to tough to get b or b tough to get an a
3.5,M,attendance counts for points i finished the class with but he gave me an a cause i was always there and participated four papers six tests online cumulative final tests can be kinda vague so definitely study textbook really comes in handy dr peters is a really nice guy and a decent professor
5.0,M,dr peters is the type of professor every prof should strive to be he exudes passion for his material and for student success yes his class is difficult but you learn so much and if going to go into debt i want to learn i also might add the difficulty has nothing to do with lack of clarity or lack of helpfulness
4.0,W,i loved dr telecom class she really knows all of her stuff and i found her lectures interesting and at times very enjoyable she uses a lot of examples and often asks for people to participate and i often felt bad because hardly anyone beyond the same few would participate really cheerful and has a great sense of humor
4.5,W,one of the best classes i have taken at iu and that is because professor parameswaran was so fantastic the nature of the course is interesting so that really helps when there is a lot of reading assigned prof p makes you work for your grade but she is very genuine and is one of the best personalities of the iu journalism faculty
1.0,W,worst professor at ccsu avoid her if you can because you learn
1.0,W,worst professor at ccsu avoid her if you can
2.0,W,i honestly have trouble coming up with how to describe her as a professor disorganized off-topic irrelevant and even contradicted the assigned textbook material often enough for it to be an issue however i barely showed up to class never bought the book took all her tests at the end of the semester she allows makeups and got an a
2.5,W,i was so hot and cold with this class there were some days where she actually taught the material and other days where she just rambled on about nothing and made me wish have stayed home in bed she can be pretty funny and sometimes her lectures were interesting
4.0,W,lectures are always interesting and well organized likes class participation but it guarantee you a good grade tough marker but her suggestions will make you a better writer be prepared to put a lot of work into assignments if you want to do well topics come directly from class discussion so read the books and go to class
5.0,M,great teacher pick him if you actually want to learn something and get an a
5.0,M,he is a really good professor he gives his real life examples in his lectures tests are easy and is a very lenient marker he is very polite and goes easy on students he is one of the best professors had so far
3.5,W,mrs moore is so helpful that at almost every opportunity there is a chance for extra credit shes helpful and like in any class do the homework thats the only way to pass she makes time available to help via office hours and through email and she has an si leader help the class definitely gave me an opportunity to be happy with math again
2.5,W,i will be honest i am horrible at math she teaches half lecture and the rest online you must get them right or you receive credit have a question regarding the homework she only has limited hours so expect to have a question or two only because all have time for get ready for a ton of homework tough
4.5,W,she was an amazing professor lectures go by very fast and almost all of the time you are out of class minutes early she got to know all of her students would definitely recommend her
3.5,W,no tests are given all you have to do is write the papers she truly cares about her students and learns each students name works with you on anything you need help with makes class go by fast
5.0,W,i took her just for an arthumanities and since i like to write i thought this was perfect in this class we all sat in a circle had group discussions critiqued each other and she gave awesome feedback very open and laid back plus hilarious and sweet
4.5,M,everyone was telling me how hard intermediate micro is but it really too bad if you go to class prof walker only tests on the material he teaches in class and assigns in homework just go take good notes and study a tiny bit and youll be fine walker passes more students than any of the other econ professors so take with him
5.0,W,best professor ever had i want to be her when i grow up
2.0,W,an unforgiving grader take anything late it could be seconds late but it might as well have been days late she take it she may be good at english but she really know how to teach it always spend class time wisely may act like she care about the students but she really
4.5,W,professor woody explains concepts in more than one way so everyone can understand she is enthusiastic about the subject which makes lectures engaging the tas do most of the grading but she is there at her office hours for extra help or clarification this was by far my favorite class of the quarter
4.5,W,professor saunders is very clear on what you should expect for a lit class if you have questions ask her if you understand why you got a certain grade she will answer it and give decent to good feed back also make sure you do the work participate at least three times on the discussion board and she is very fair with grades as well
5.0,W,she was very passionate about her teaching she always tell you what would be on her tests attendance sometimes is required in order to know what is going on in the class surrounding she is very kind and helpful not a lot of homework in her class though easy a
4.5,W,rohy is quirky for sure but she is able to break down the most complicated material to anyone also she encourages adventurous essay topics the more outlandish the better the readings can be boring at times but her lectures never have an agenda in other words the students lead the discussion and she is there to help out when needed
4.5,W,overall dr jackson is a good professor friendly and easy to reach jackson is very picky and i also believes she grades students based on her history with them as this was an week course the work was fairly easy but increased toward the end make sure to have the materials and read the class discussions were great you must participate
3.5,M,he is a bit rude and gets annoyed when you ask for help however his class is ridiculously easy show up for the reviews get the test questions and study that he will teach you what you need to know but only tests a narrow spectrum of the material if you want a great grade take him
3.5,M,good professor took him in the summer class exams are based on his reviews
1.5,M,mitra is very smart with that said however not very good at teaching expect to furiously write the examples he solves on the board leaving the class confused and teaching yourself no hw and there are exams plus a final he does drop the lowest grade of one of the regular exams if not very good at math say stay away
4.0,M,hard to understand when you first start the class but then it gets easier his tests are exactly the same questions he did in class and on the review day you need the textbook
2.0,M,i dont know how that buddy get an a with average grade on exams are but he still gave me b wht is that
3.5,M,great professor received an a w and above on all exam drops the lowest grade not sure wht my departmental grade was but very linear show that you care attend all classes makes a key difference on if getting a b or a exams even the departmental comes from his miss them go over class probs should b ok
3.0,W,took her voodoo class that was an experience she assigns several page essays throughout the course an a research paper for a final she is nice but a little crazy she gets very excited about slavery without taking into account the ethnicity of her students lectures make an interesting subject incredibly boring not my major but got an a
4.0,W,only three quizzes and three tests homework is not collected she goes over material fast but teaches clearly go to class gives a lot of extra credit take her if you are pre-nursing one of the better stats professors hard work but an a is definitely attainable
4.5,W,a great professor pay attention if you taken stats but if you did then pretty much review i suggest going to tutoring and do the homework it really helps with practice go to lectures important tests are easy if you know what doing i suggest her as a stats professor no midterm cheatsheet for final easy
4.5,W,she is so funny easy class if you show up and pay attention the homework really necessary the quizzes and exams are more similar to the format of her in class examples and same quizzes
2.0,W,this class was really challenging for me she is a good professor but moves really quickly so i recommend going to tutoring if you want to pass the class three quizzes three tests and a cumulative final most people would get cs-fs on the exams she curves the class at the end knowing that most people either drop or will fail
5.0,W,i warn you you will pass as long as you take notes her are pretty much the examples that she uses on her lectures i also had her in a lh so be sure to sit up front stats is hard overall but she tries her best to organize everything and sometimes curves the tests she gives homework to do but collect calculator must
5.0,W,applied math major here def one of the best math profs taken at csulb i would jump at any opportunity to take her again great professor and person
5.0,W,she is an amazing professor who goes above and beyond to make sure you understand the material take her over any other professor i ended up with a b but only because i study nor did i take the small quizzes important the quizzes really add up
5.0,W,i loved her class i was very engaged throughout the entire semester the class format is very straight forward and she gives some extra credit the gives review sessions before each test which are very helpful i highly recommend her for any class
4.0,M,tough class but as long as you go to class and do all the homework questions you should be fine he was the most available professor to offer help with any questions i had at utsa study sessions every sunday afternoon and every day after class
3.0,M,i took this class online over the winter session after reading his reviews i figured the course would be a walk in the park however i was extremely misinformed the tests are extremely difficulttricky and the work load is intense do not expect this class to be a breeze passed but not sure i would take again it was pretty frustrating
2.5,M,he is not clear and his lectures make class go on forever he puts his lectures online so you have to go to class but class helped a lot i really learn anyhting from him it was mostly just the tas
5.0,M,professor reed has clear well constructed lectures that specifically prepare you for the exams this is not a memorize and pass class you need to be able to digest the information and explain diverse factors to support a thesis statement for the exams the assigned reading is essential take notes his lectures are very helpful
4.0,M,i really liked this teacher and his lectures were really interesting the tests are easy if you take notes you really need the book if you take good notes in class and if you need help the are the ones you need to talk to he gave us the question beforehand so we could write an outline for the exams
2.5,M,his lectures are long the way he talks makes you want to sleep and the tests are not a good time three blue book essays it not very understanding old geezer type who care about your grades class not overly challenging but would not recommend taking it from him
3.0,M,the tests on his class is in class had writing a paper about one question that he randomly choose from two questions he gave us earlier i just understand why would anybody test student like that why him just let us write the paper and turn in like a regular professor
4.5,W,i took this class anthropology of humor and laughter and many told me it would be very hard i took it anyway because it seemed interesting ewa is interesting engaging and her class is easy if you know how to pay attention write and apply topics easy class nice lady
2.5,W,difficult grader jams lot of info into her power points give you good feed back
1.0,W,avoid this class and professor at all costs lectures are a long convoluted mess that do little to further your knowledge ewa is one of those unapproachable apparently infallible professors whose exams will straight up fail an entire class after which she will spend a good chunk of the next class making demeaning remarks to you and your peers
2.5,W,i took the online class the multiple choice exams were pretty straightforward the questions are taken from her powerpoints which are very detailed and helpful we had to write reflection papers and i did well on the first one however not so well on the others however she was more flexible with the final grade
3.0,W,her class was a three hour lecture where she talked nonstop pretty impressive really she definitely knows her stuff we had three take-home tests which consisted of several questions which she expected answered like any paper lots of research needed to get a good grade most people got a c or low b very tough class
5.0,M,very unique class format as we do the talking instead of him more of us self-learning with splane as the one overseeing things big perk about this course is that the textbook is online so practically clear cut mac users will have slight issues but it can be worked around if available to teach then take his class
4.5,W,she is a wonderful instructor for yoga i enjoyed the class and she worked with me on doing other positions if i could not do what others could because of an she is very mindful of that
4.5,W,best yoga instructor had she is very enthusiastic and inspirational
1.5,W,prof was rude and condescending asked for help on multiple occasions and felt like she was annoyed that i had any questions in an online course she did not communicate effectively and gave short notice of deadline changes overall the class was neither challenging nor helpful and was generally unpleasant would not recommend
3.0,W,she uses a point system that confused most of the students we had quizzes everyday over the chapters tests too hard but she did provide one extra credit assignment
5.0,W,i just love her easy class work on your own was and is good
4.5,W,took this class online very straight forward at the end of each week four chapter tests were due along with four separate responses to each chapter she allowed for the test to be taken twice keeping the highest of the two grades the final exam could only be taken once commit to reading the book she has no problem answering questions
3.5,W,as im sure she loves what she does her teaching method was not for me if you are a self learner then you will be bored in this class read the book and follow the online assignments and you will pass this is part of my major and i didnt learn anything from the teacher also read the syllabus explains her grading style
1.0,W,i did not like this professor at all rude condescending and belittling to her students she never actually gets to the point of what trying to say so understanding anything in her class is really difficult and then she makes you feel stupid for not understanding and having to ask questions i would never recommend taking her class
1.5,W,she doesnt really email you about anything excpet to tell the entire class if your not doing your work then to drop her way of grading is really confusing and she is kind of rude
5.0,M,glenn is the best person ever known let alone best professor he inspires me in so many ways i have lost track his choice in flowy big print shirts impeccable take this class if you want to have the time of your life while learning basic computer skills
4.5,M,glen is a goof ball super clear and very understanding of the students he talks a lot and often repeats things but at least you wont forget going onwhen tests are if you practice for the simnet quizzes you will pass the lecture quizzes were a little more difficult but probably cause i always pay attention during lectures
2.5,M,i really love this teachers enthusiasm but the subject still bores me be ready for his long useless talking about nothing but try to enjoy his sense of humor if you can study please i wish i could fix my grade
3.5,M,this class was so freaking hard sure its easy for mathsciency people but this was just really confusing to me the lecture was so freaking boring he is a nice man though
3.5,M,read a lot of reviews about how dr caspi is emotionless but he does try to notice and get to know your personality but you have to be open have my off days and always notice and he genuinely cared in regards to the class he likes messing with your head but its a good learning tool for this specific class i found it interesting
1.5,M,nice man and really knows his stuff but if looking to take an easy class that sounds interesting find a different one too smart to teach this gen-ed class
1.0,M,do you enjoy wasting hours of your week learning about the opinions of a self-involved professor who is unaware of his needs then this is the class for you i have never been so bored in a class no participation he just talked for hours class more about classic authors than freud orjung could not recommend this minicourse less
5.0,M,prof amrine is the best professor ever had extremely intelligent person great to talk to go to office hours take all of his classes your perspective on lifethe universeexistencephilosophywhatever it is will broaden this is what college is all about
3.5,W,dr lorden is sweet and she honestly just aims at giving you the absolute best learning experience she can with that said get ready to work because yes you learn a lot thankfully her lectures are pretty helpful and she made the math eay to get she often calls on you in class she is a good teacher tough course can be slow to reply to emails
3.5,M,eric is one of my favorite people let alone favorite professor his class is one of the only that i participate in you have lots of reading assignments and kind of hard to understand but very interesting he gets to know his students and makes everyone feel like what they say is important i wish i could have him for every class
4.0,M,dr ruckh is that one crazy college professor that everyone hears about but no one seems to find find that it be easy the assignments are very ambiguous but if you talk with him and honestly try in this class the results are extremely rewarding truly deserves to be called a teacher
4.5,M,dr hupp is one of my favorite professors ever his lectures are fun yet informative never be bored in class but still learn a lot the funny stories he tells about his kids really help with the material sometimes if you show up and pay attention you should do just fine in his child psych course
3.0,W,tabitha is stict and pretty dense on the material she obviously knows what talking about but she moves really fast though her lectures leaving the class scrambling to jot everything down her quote are obscure and difficult to succeed in without memorizing the whole text but she is a fair marker in other regards
4.0,W,shaw is really tough and you definitely have to study hard and do the reading however one of my favorite art history teachers because so passionate and because she cares about quality really willing to put in the time to help you succeed so long as you do the same not a lot of tests puts more emphasis on writing
2.5,M,he says that available to talk about assignments and loves to see what students have come up with but every time i talked to him he just grimaced and gave one-word answers not helpful in the slightest also expect to lose credit on fully functional programs because they meet specific criteria that he share with the class
4.5,M,very tough grader your work has to be perfect in order to receive credit however the assignment very very clearly defines its requirements and you even get a chance to correct and resubmit your projects after the grades are released exams are open-notes book and internet follow his instructions exactly and do fine
4.0,M,my advice meticulously read every letter of his assignment twice to make sure you miss anything give you a zero if you do otherwise very knowledgeable and interesting has a dry humor and can be pretty stoic he scares me sometimes would still take again though
1.0,M,gives you a zero on your project if you are missing a newline or have entered an extra newline even if the project is functional is unwilling to help you even if you meet him in person i met him in person and asked what i could do differently so he asked me what i could do differently wtf
4.0,M,lectures are energetic and interesting covering many topics each lecture without repeating himself a ton happy to answer questions during the class overall a great professor would take him for every class if i could
1.5,M,i like him for the first few weeks then everything went downhill he likes to digress a lot he never gives hints about what are on the test and he suggested to read up carither slides even though nothing similar on his test if you want to understand and get good grade avoid him harrddd grader
4.5,M,very tough class very amazing professor his exams are difficult and often contain vague information that he only mentioned briefly in class if you get any aspect of the problem wrong expect partial credit super clear in lectures but you have to work really hard for a good grade
4.5,M,i had professor white for comp sci for ap students no textbook that i remember labs are weekly but not overly difficult if had coding experience before if you pay attention in class he will often describe how to do anything tricky in the lab and always willing to help if you ask
4.5,M,insanely good lecturer interesting to listen to fun and extremely fair really cool guy overall talk to you about pretty much anything really looking forward to taking more of his classes
1.0,W,attend her class or you know what doing the notes she posted online posted a day before the exam at that matter does nothing to assist your studies she does not explain her answers through her notes so you have to be in class that day to understand anything that is going on also very confusing during office hour
5.0,M,barden is amazing he explains micro without torturing you like some other teachers he is more keen on you understanding the larger picture and wants you to apply logic also during his exams i loved his lectures his hilarious so that helps and always open for you to pop up during office hours for extra clarification hands down my fav prof
5.0,M,barden was by far my favorite teacher he is hilarious and makes microbiology interesting easy to understand and lectures boring you dont need book all tests could be done right off of his slides amazing professor
3.0,M,the class is hard no matter where it is taken and he does try to make it clear what random small things may be on the test which is helpful and he looks like santa so theres that
5.0,M,doctor kelly is extremely genuine and smart if you have a good base in chemistry and read the materials before classes you could understand all of his lectures and average in the b or a range at the end of the year his exams similar to previous exams secretly shared by students and he always gives feedback in afterhours strongly recommend
4.5,M,dr kelley is extremely clear if you would open your ears and pay attention yes just like every class you need to go over notes and study his exams are on par with what he teaches unfortunately a an option in this school but an a is just as good here he has a great personality and always willing to help if you need it
3.0,M,he looks like santa claus no joke on a more serious note though his class particularly difficult as long as you spend a whole lot of time studying and memorizing stuff there usually is a curve both on the exam itself as well as for your last grade
1.5,M,irresponsible the answer of exam may be wrong you need to check very carefully after you are graded otherwise you will easily get a low score since it is graded based on a wrong answer he is very irrespective to students the standard for project grade is very unclear if you argue with him he will satire you and let you shut up
4.5,W,love susan she is so friendly and so energetic if hard on you it is because she has your best interest at heart she is very approachable if you have any issue with her or her marking such a wonderful teacher
1.0,W,unclear expectations treats you like a child and listen to anything students say really disrespectful and unhelpful gives good feedback but provide the support to apply the feedback hard marker especially in practicum never answers emails or requests a meeting in person just pray for the semesters that you have her
3.5,W,susan is a fantastic teacher i understand how people say she but to each their own yes she talks a little fast in lecture but has no problem repeating herself if needed she is understanding friendly and approachable susan actually makes classes fun i find her to be a hard marker whatsoever she gives great feed back
3.0,W,she speaks really quickly and sometimes hard to take notes but she gives out powerpoints she makes her classes interesting and fun with her silly stories hard marker but gives amazing feed back overall one of my favorite teachers in the program
2.0,W,this lady may seem hilarious and bubbly the first time you take her class but my oh my is she fake her lectures i like whaaaat she talks way too fast for you to even take notes barely ever replies to your emails tough in practicum and her exams are way more difficult than u would expect because her lectures or so damn brief
1.5,M,i lasted two days in ear training before i switched not only was he extremely unclear but he also made me feel very uncomfortable when i asked if i could test out of his class depending on the mind you have ear training is either very easy or very difficult he hates students with absolute pitch but many others fail his class
1.0,M,dr roter goes through material so fast your hands will be on fire sometimes he go through the terms we need to know and expects us to know when the test comes up his matching section in tests are vague so the only way is to take a guess unreasonable when the answer i gave was correct but wanted something else deduct it
3.5,M,tough but he knows his stuff but you need to let him know if struggling if you gonna fall behind tough grader if you have one blemish on a chord identification points off of the quiz it adds up study and make it
3.5,M,he is visibly enthusiastic about the content he teaches which always makes class enjoyable he brings in people multiple times during the semester to teach us first hand about japanese culture which was really interesting and broke up the lecturing the only thing i hated was the mandatory book we had to read so boring confusing and tedious
5.0,W,one of my favorite classes at loyola she is the sweetest professor and she really cares about you she is always there for you if you need help in her class this class is not the easiest but it is do-able and go to office hours do all the homework and you will do good on the test preparing for the class is how you will get an a in this class
5.0,W,awesome teacher always comes into class fully prepared and happy to teach she gives you weeks ahead of time so you can organize yourself early on she has a lot of connections and experience in law so it would be wise to be friendly with her in hopes she can help you out in the future take this class enjoy it and receive an easy a
3.5,M,pat is one of the most amazing and approachable professors wfu he genuinely cares about student learning not grades and inspires students to take learnings beyond the classroom a real asset to the facility of the university i would definitely take him again if possible
1.0,M,i felt so discouraged after this class i always thought when things are a myth there is no right or wrong answer sorry but to him there is only his right
2.5,W,class was on-line a week summer session not very helpful responds to emails at her convince i had to wait a week to review a test as she was on vacation min is not enough time for tests with depth of work on questions better to take the class during a regular semester with a professor who wants you to succeed not sure she does
4.5,W,her internal audit class was an excellent elective that helped me better understand the materials in my other classes the group project had some rough points but she is a very lenient grader she lets you take the iia certification exam in lieu of the final but i would recommend you just take the final her tests are not difficult at all
5.0,W,best professor in the menifee campus very easy and fun class coming from someone who used to hate english i took her for and and now i am her si leader class tutor i highly recommend this class you can get an easy a if you keep up with the work wonderful person
4.0,W,the best english class i ever had her instructions are clear and brief she is a very easy going professor the paper are super easy and you even get to revise it for a higher grade
5.0,W,this teacher taught me a lot i asked for help all the time and she always helped me the class was hard though i learned and that what teachers are about kindness is one word that discribes lorrie i liked her because she was good at what she does english writing grammar and found it easy to talk to her
5.0,W,best english teacher i have ever known she is so helpful and goes above and beyond for her students i would take her for if she taught it
1.0,W,taking her class right now and to be honest one word to describe her is unorganized her lectures are all over the place puts up power points for like seconds then moves on i tried to approach her for some help but she looks at me like i was dumb for not understanding the first time hands out way too many papers and does not explain them
3.5,W,loved mrs perry at the beginning of the semester she said the class would be hard but as long as you read the text and pay attention to her lectures you should pass with flying colors she applies some of her life stories to her lectures which makes it very easy to understand of extra credit opportunities as well
2.5,W,there are tests final and paper nice and approachable but unorganized be prepared to write really fast always take notes as she often asks s at the end of class and expects you to answer in the form of a short paragraph she also puts you into groups her tests are hard her lectures have little to do with whats on the test
4.0,M,i loved evolution with bro zenger the subject matter itself is pretty easy just read from the text book and discuss in class there is a very large paper you have to write which is a lot of work but you get to choose what you write about so that helps bro zenger is a great teacher and he cares deeply about his students
4.0,W,she is amazing she came around to every single recitation to try to get to know her students enough said she will always be there for you to answer any questions you have and will defiantly try to curve your grade up a bit if she sees hard working and diligent
4.5,W,professor schauer is a passionate compassionate person she is patient beyond measure and helps students succeed she fosters a place of learning not just spitting out the right answers schauer encourages questions not just perfection she takes classes out of her profession so she understands being person in and out of class
5.0,W,cynthia is an awesome instructor i am sad this will be my last class with her i took her for both cell biology and microbiology and really enjoyed her class she is super smart and really cares about the students doing well and wont let you give up her lectures are interesting and labs are so much fun
4.5,M,barry cohen is one of the best computer science professors in njit his use of class time is remarkable except for the times when he goes off into tangents he is very knowledgeable about the material and his use of classroom assistants is definitely made to help students i would highly recommend him
2.5,M,decent lecturer but came off as very lazy showing frontline documentaries almost every class and giving the entire class a same grade on papers reference the textbook once but gave a final based on stuff in it that he come close to discussing in class frustrating dislike him personally but not a good teach at all
1.5,W,super passive-aggressive asked her simple questions and gets confused tried to dumb the question down and ask again and she still was confused not surprised a lot of people dropped quizzes and boring documentaries every week would not take again
1.0,W,terrible at explaining gets highly confused over any questions most disorganized teacher ever had wastes most of the time in the course actually teach just grades would have dropped this class after first class if i listened to my instincts she should be fired i love art and wanted to learn more too bad i had to teach myself
2.5,W,a good person but her teaching skills are not the best she will help you if you stay after class very boring and she can barely hear the tests are difficult but easy to get your grade up i had a d and the final brought me up to b with only question right it was out of over questions
2.5,W,devote your life to her class work hard make many sacrifices and you will still not smell the paradise of an a only thing i liked about her class was before the research project
3.0,W,i withdrew from her class she is super tough and the class average can be between the c and d range at times a lot of writing is expected in and out of class and is super strict about grammar and mla format one mistake and you are done the class went down to about students from being full when i withdrew she tries to be funny
2.0,W,do it no run find another professor took comp online she never gives a grade higher than a b really i asked her she said very rare she gives an a unless its advanced college work go to the next professor
2.5,W,she the worse but lecture is sometimes all over the place she is technologically challenged and she jumps back and forth through topics so it can be hard to take notes
3.0,W,kristine is an alright professor she can be a little off sometimes and she forgets to put discussion questions up on icon a lot for exams need to focus more on examples rather than the actual definitions the exams super hard but i learned the hard way for the first half of the test the papers are short to pages hard
4.0,M,loved this class no nonsense approach to teaching conveys the critical information and explains its significance and application would take labour law again with him in heartbeat
5.0,M,he is just a great professor and do not hesitate to take his course explains things well
5.0,M,toni hage helps you understand chemistry he is there for you if you want to learn tests are not multiple choice so you must know your material all the material is covered in the lectures
5.0,M,great teacher he is clear and he explains step by step he is the best teacher ever i love his class i hope he can teach my he covers the all book and i need to buy it mr tony the best teacher ever
4.5,W,she is very helpful during her office hours as well as class time tries to set you up for success
4.5,W,dr brown is great extremely energetic she can be hard to keep up with but she really knows what doing i would definitely recommend her anatomy is pretty horrible so having a good instructor makes a big difference
5.0,W,love her she very helpful and very animated during class to keep attention had her in anatomy now physiology anatomy was a little harder she gave extra credit on almost every exam she gives really good study guides in physio and tells you almost exactly what you need to know regret not taking her wish she taught every bio class
2.5,M,he is a good teacher explain well but hard grader
3.0,M,it is pointless to go to class except for the weekly quizzes at the end of class just teach yourself from the textbook and work through problems his tests are easy because the questions come from the textbook the department final was also pretty easy but i would say this class is easy for those who can self-teach
5.0,M,this professor is amazingly passionate about the courses he teaches thoroughly knowledgeable and cares about what the students think during lecture definitely take a course with him if you can
4.5,M,absolutely my favourite professor hands down funny passionate very caring about his students and the subject
4.0,M,this professor is wonderful i had him for two of my courses his lectures are delivered as if in theatre so you cannot possibly fall asleep in class
5.0,M,great lectures he knows his stuff and is really passionate about the topics the textbook was short and well written a funny and engaging speaker i will definitely take a course with him again
3.5,W,professor praitis is helpful but she really takes off a lot of marks on attendance she curves not in a good way if she wants only three a in class she gives your final paper and poster bs without telling you any reason so that your overall grade can fall from a to a or b on her class be careful on your every homework and quizzes
5.0,W,loved professor class she manages to explain a lot of pretty difficult concepts in easy-to-understand terms lab independent projects are a lot of fun and always more than willing to help you with anything lab or class-related quizzes require you to show your knowledge rather than vomit up a bunch of stuff memorized
5.0,W,best professor ever happen to me d she is nice and give respectful feedback on every piece of homework you submit she taught wonderful genetics and she knows what she is talking about during class she is also super helpful on projects definitely recommend her to anyone
5.0,M,probably one of tbe best teachers at mcgill but his tests are very hard be prepared to put a lot of time in this course make sure you understand the material well do as many previous midterms and finals as you can this class is for sure the hardest one taken at mcgill
2.0,M,bush is the type of guy who only wants to hear what he wants to hear he like when people correct him and he assigns many assignments multiple due on the same day sometimes forgets they were even due also his favorite thing is calling on every single person in the class and putting them on the spot with questions
5.0,W,dr slusher is everything you want in your nursing professor--tremendous depth of knowledge clarity in delivering the material great examples from her personal experience humor ability to make neither content nor the grading will leave you questioning her teaching and she brings candy
2.5,W,knows her stuff but i did not enjoy having her as my professor she is rude i could have made a better grade if i had known how to study the questions in the back of the fundamentals of nursing book were helpful but you do best by studying the powerpoints test was mainly over the syllabus be sure to study
4.5,W,dr slusher is passionate about her work and nursing as a profession i have personally enjoyed learning a about h e r experiences she provides examples pertinent to content she is teaching and encourages class participation enhancing optimal learning she sets high expectations for student success and accountability which i admire and applaud
1.0,W,dr slusher is one of the rudest professors i have ever had she is the exact reason why i am changing my major this semester she grades the semester paper extremely difficult she treats her students like they do not matter the exams are rough she will tell you something will be on the exam and it wont be
3.5,M,the class is a handful of small lab reports that can be graded tough lab notebook checks and participation the participation grade can save you he is very sweet wants to help and is very considerate he is incredibly intelligent so sometimes his lectures are over heads
4.0,M,very tough grader a very goof professor though explains everything very clear you must study every night to pass his tests his tests might not seem too hard but trust me they are very difficult would recommend him to anyone but you must be willing to dedicate a lot of time to this class
5.0,M,great prof knowledge is second hand to none so far of those who met so far in my life grading scale is clear will stay as long as you need after class to help you on anything you need even offers to help students with other classes if he can had him for a couple classes learned a lot from him
1.5,M,this is the most frustrating class i have ever taken he literally does not teach he gives you chemactivities and you are supposed to learn from your fellow students the only plus is you get multiple chances to get the correct answer on on a computer i would not recommend him at all
1.5,W,horrible i read reviews about how tough she was but i chose to ignore them thinking that they were exaggerating her instructions are not clear she expects things to be done if not done she gives you a low grade does not give feedback in a timely manner do not take her class she teach she assigns reading videos from sfsu lib
3.0,W,you dont even need to come to class i only came sometimes for the comfy seats there is no late policy for any of her work she doesnt believe in midterms or finals exams so thats a plus very easy if you put in some effort in her essays
2.5,M,for a level class this was brutal his powerpoints are just endless slides of paragraphs that make no freaking sense the exams are all essays or terms which he even list off so you basically have rummage through all of the slides and guess what may or may not be on the exam worst class ever taken a nice guy tho
3.0,M,the entire class is based on the midterm and the final exam you really have to do the readings until studying and theres no textbook so thats a bonus study hard for the exams and do fine he is incredibly intelligent take this class if looking for an easy mark
5.0,M,nice experienced professor always available for help either in email phone or in person great feedback on assignments i would recommend him
3.0,W,i took her for a fast-track class it was worth it but expect to put in work for your grade she makes you do powerpoints at home and then the next day in class she re-lectures you on what you learned last night and its very boring you need to show up to class because right after lectures you do a lab or learn an astronomical equation for tests
4.0,W,eisberg is awesome hardest class taken but so incredibly worth it she is passionate about what she teaches she is there for assistance if you need it she wants to help the students i loved the content i would totally recommend her
4.5,M,dr tjandra is the best chemistry professor i have ever taken his lectures are very good he uses a combination of powerpoint and boardwork to explain his topics and he does this very well his tests are tough and the lab reports are long so make sure that you are studying and have the time set apart for this class super time-consuming
5.0,W,i wish dr sweely would teach all of my other courses she is the brightest ray of sunshine even on the gloomiest day essays and exams make up the entire course grade so do well so you having to bring up your grade all semester so wonderful i plan on taking another one of her courses next semester
5.0,W,she is the best professor and one of the most lovely human beings i have ever met
5.0,W,wonderful professor she loves what she does and she understands that this class essential for your career all you have to do is write two short easy papers a powerpoint presentation midterm and final the can be difficult if not good at memorizing but east a
5.0,W,she is probably the nicest professor you will ever have if you need an easy a for your arts humanities credit this is the class and professor for you
5.0,W,she is sweet love her class and care about her student easy to get an a
5.0,W,loved this class lectures were boring sometimes but it was an interesting class gay really loves teaching it she will repeat that a lot it is an easy class not many assignments and the exams are all memorization would recommend easy a
5.0,W,loved dr sweely she is awesome not a hard class and she gives study guides for test she keeps the class interesting even if you are not into art and there was not many assignments i would defiantly take her again sweetest lady ever
5.0,W,she is the best she is easy and funny it s really easy to get an a in this class there are homework in this class and one project they r easy to do there r tests and she gives u the study guide for them i highly recommend her
3.5,M,fisher was the funniest biology professor had if you payed attention during lecture and read the chapters the class was easy would take him second semester if i could
4.0,M,dr fisher was awesome he says the funniest corny jokes during class he keeps his lectures interesting records all lectures on tegrity but you have to come to class in order to get the clicker points tests were not difficult for me but were difficult for classmates class averages on exams were usually in the low final exam was easy
1.0,M,he speaks very monotone and does not keep students engaged by any means thus it is very hard to stay awake and the way he presents material makes it difficult to remember this makes the exams incredibly difficult the exams are also random and unrelated to in-class information fisher is also very wishy-washy when it comes to class policies
3.0,M,this guy is hysterical his class is fairly easy as easy as bio can get--some topics are just difficult by nature and ok but he super clear on supposed to be on the test with that in mind tests are still pretty fair and definitely the most fun professor to take wish he was teaching second semester
5.0,M,dr james is filled with tons of excellent information he provides resources to help guide you through the readings participation and doing assignment using the resources provided you are sure to do well
3.5,M,dr james at first i was hesitant to take his class as i signed up for another professor but the class was split due to size i am very glad i had dr james his tests are long and he is a little disorganized at times but his lectures are fun and he is very passionate about history will make you work for your grade overall i really liked him
5.0,M,very passionate about teaching i was worried about taking him he seemed like he would be a tough teacher that care about students passing on day one i have been more wrong he was very knowledgeable and willing to answer questions quizzes are mc and based on reading exams are short answer and essays know mla format papers
4.0,M,not the easy a but he makes that clear from day you will work for it the essays are easy just wait until the last day to do them study for the quizzes by doing the activities on nortonstudyspace and read the corresponding page numbers from the quizzes flashcards or you will fail them good lectures and invested in his students
2.5,M,welcome to college because in this class you must read the textbook you have to write papers he give out a study guide he says the lecture is on one wavelength the textbook is on another and the tests cover both wavelengths you must study before the tests be surprised if i pass the class
2.0,M,lectures are good but quizzes based on them gives a lot of work and assigns pgs to read for every days when i took his class i was taking four others thank god my other classes have a big load of homework like he did for the exams he tells you that its covers things that are on the outline which is basically everything
2.0,M,he is a good guy i loved him but i understand his accent this problem bothered all foreigner students he takes just two tests midd term and final and review for tests sessions
3.5,M,his terrible so long as someone answers his open ended questions just stand there until someone does helpful if you have questions but a bit odd the grading bad but the journal questions really add up so stay on top of the assignments
3.5,M,one of my favorite professors at cstate highly knowledgable helpful friendly and hilarious preparation homework and reading are essential all are in-class essays but he gives you the questions ahead of time so you can prepare and allows you to bring notes to the exam take if you want to learn look elsewhere for an easy a
5.0,M,i would recommend him expect homework but very manageable if you do the work you should be able to easily pass he is upfront about what quizzes are over and midtermsfinal
2.0,W,i liked the course more than i liked the professor professor lape rarely updated announcements gave no feedback on anything was not professional with her email responses she did not help me much with anything really and she was too subjective with a lot of things the class was pretty easy but she barely did anything all semester
4.0,W,i loved this class dr lape does give test but easy if you read the readings i read half the readings and kept up on the weeklies she post which summarized each ready and writer use the weeklies for the test easy to pass if you can readwrite english
5.0,W,she is the best teacher i have ever had she gives you a ton of control over your writing assignments and really wants you to find your own writing voice i would definitely take any class of hers i looked forward to english class every week
4.0,M,this class is extremely straight forward dr perkins literally wrote the book for this class this means do what he says and you will make an a unfortunately he asks a lot with homework assignments nearly every class however if you just put a little bit of time into the class throughout the semester it will be one of your easiest classes
2.0,M,a few of us are currently having a study group for this class right now for the final exam the problem noticed in the midterm is that even though our arguments are fully supported which fulfills the requirement of a good answer as long as he agree with your opinion he will dispute the answer and give it a bad grade
1.5,M,he is very opinionated and arrogant his ego is through the roof
1.0,M,the worst anything that contradicts his argument he dismisses as it matter cause just comics then why are you teaching a course on them in one class a girl called him out on taking a quote out of context his response i know but so much more delicious this way great reading list but all avoid him like the plague
4.0,M,prof lesk is an amazing speaker his lectures are clear concise and very interesting he grades fairly but not too rough i think the negative feedback for him on here must mostly be from people who do their readings and consequently got poor marks he put up with offensive opinions but encourages discussion
5.0,W,awesome class manas is a first-rate professor she is a bit intimidating because of her superior knowledge and her great style sense the content is hard but doable if you read the help from friends
4.5,M,lectures are engaging and he uses several different media to keep students interested an awesome resource if struggling and definitely help you out as much as he can overall really awesome funny and helpful prof
5.0,M,david briggs is the best teacher i have ever had in any subject he is knowledgeable kind funny and helpful both his classes are excellent and have taught me a lot about the subject matter and life in general his classes are great to get you in shape and have fun and learn
5.0,M,this is one of the best classes i have taken at bucks he really cares if you can protect yourself in the real world you can apply what he teaches to you in you daily life this is a class i recommend for every student he is a great inspiration
4.5,W,she was difficult for a level course four tests all semester including the final not difficult at all as long as you do the work and take the notes i loved her great personality
1.0,W,this class is an absolute joke the class material will put you to sleep and have you wondering why you are even in the class the teacher is rude and very annoying it is a level gen ed class and she acts like it is a level class or something way to much pointless work way to hard of grading work and in general just an unlikeable person
4.5,W,dr spock is one smart lady not many people know as much about history as she does especially when it comes to the mongols and russia if you are a history minor or major you will benefit greatly from her class however if you are taking it for a gen ed then expect a lot of reading taking notes studying and hard work she grades essays hard
3.5,W,this class is doable but given another option i would have definitely taken it a lot of unnecessary reading and responding the tests quizzes are difficult and the essays are impossible she does offer a lot of help though so that entirely too much work for a gen ed course
4.0,M,if you are having issues with this class drop out of the school of journalism this is as easy as it gets show up to class pay the least bit of attention and get out with an a the content is incredibly interesting just listen he spoon feed it to you he expects you to learn not gonna hold your hand great prof
2.5,M,professor stecker was very knowledagble about philosophy however if you need to take the class take it he gives you handouts with everything you need to know but classes were very dry and boring he had no clear scheduale and papers had no comments
2.0,M,i know what he was teaching or grading on and i think he did either at the end of the year i feel like he just gave everyone a b and moved on the class was fine if you mind not learning anything
1.0,M,really knowledgeable about the subject but absolutely awful at teaching it at the end of the class i had no clue what he was trying to teach he even tell us there was a final until like a week before the exam if i need this class for my minor i would have dropped it in a heartbeat
1.0,M,ghorashi is a nice enough guy but the class was awful being in the class was agony nothing but student presentations and meandering pointless lectures by the professor he really explain any of the homework or projects finishing his assignments felt like guess work honestly i even know if he knew what he expected us to do
1.0,M,worst teacher ever there is no syllabus or a need for a textbook half of the time i feel like he makes up things as he goes along no midterm or final but weekely journal articles and minute presentations on pointless topics very hard to understand him as well avoid him at all costs
1.0,M,i really wish some other professor would teach intro to global studies i was forced into taking ghorashi for my minor his lectures were rambling and vague of the class time was spent doing minute presentations that explained very well honestly they just felt like an excuse for him to have us teach the class instead of him
4.5,M,such an amazing professor related everything to the real world and really engages his students with his humor and animated way of lecturing he always makes sure everyone understands each lesson will go over everything as many times as needed to help you take good notes and review for quizzes and you will do great
5.0,M,ghorashi is challenging which is probably the reason for the negative reviews that said if you make the effort to follow his lectures take notes and study outside of class you will find that he is really skilled in taking very difficult concepts and breaking them down also able to lead students to an answer without giving it outright
5.0,M,was nervous about this class but i found it to be one of the best classes ever taken thielen is organized and wants to provide a class environment where student can learn and be successful he works extremely well with hard of hearing students or disabilities highly recommend this teacher and would take him again for sure
5.0,M,passionate guy loves teaching spanish has been at the burg for three decades as long as you put in the work he will be there to help you do well
5.0,M,he teaches like a kid that is excited for a present on christmas but it makes a usually dull subject engaging i had him in the morning and he was almost better than coffee for waking me up
3.5,M,great teacher if you struggle with math he is the guy to take he explains things well it really helps unfortunately he wont be teaching stat or else i would taking him again college algebra is tough though so brace yourselves
1.5,M,very strange man i felt the class was a colossal waste of time he will go on a rant for an hour straight everyday of class just very tiring on the ears after a few weeks wants you to learn on your own but the material is non-existent basically you spend this work time on google and wikipedia
1.0,M,he is very knowledgable about his field of study however he is very unclear about what he expects he also talks about very inappropriate topics in class he is an easy a but not worth taking he is very defensive and he gets upset because nobody participates even though he makes fun of us when we ask questions not a good learning environment
1.5,M,first things first i am not a lazy student and i do all my work however this professor is something else he belittles you if you ask a question very rude and curses all the time he even teach all he does is show videos and talk about irrelevant things in class would never take again or would not recommend
4.5,M,fred smoler is by far one of the finest professors in slc i was a part of his class by complete chance and was so glad to be in his class wait to take his alternate history class coming up this semester he is a brilliant teacher and truly inspirational
2.0,M,if you need history classes do not take douglass he is not helpful he is condescending he answer questions clearly the only grades for the semester are four book quizzes a midterm and a final he grades very subjectively many times you know why he deducts points i know of anybody who earned an a in this course
1.0,M,very boring class only lectures for the whole class and sometimes pass the class time monotoned uses the word uh a lot avoid if you can his quizzes and test have hardly anything to do with the notes google helped me decently rude and not very happy space out once he starts talking its hard not too
1.0,M,the lectures are long boring and filled with information that you to know but attendance is mandatory he gives grades for the semester but his grading scale makes no sense use at all in a minute lecture that ended minutes early i kept a tally for every time he said um it ended up being
2.0,M,prof douglass seems to have social awkwardness which everyone seems to define as bad he seems very particular about his notes and wont defer if you have a question he is notorious for saying it is in the syllabus and then wont answer wasnt hard work was hard to figure what he wanted he is monotone just reads notes very dull class
1.0,M,avoid at all costs he is a very rude and boring old man his test has nothing to do with the material minute lectures feel like days honestly if his class is the only class that makes you a full time student be better to stay part time
5.0,W,a modern superwoman juggling a phd a private practice and some classes extremely kind and easy-going very intelligent and thought-provoking always left feeling like my mind had expanded a bit tells great stories and examples if i had met her earlier probably pursue a career as a therapist you get what you put in as always
2.5,M,dr terry is a great professor when it comes to knowing what he is talking about he is brilliant when it comes to finance but be warned his classes are tough no matter which class you take that he teaches if you are confused about something be afraid to ask he expects a lot out of you and for you to remember things from other classes
5.0,W,now known as patricia farrish amazing professor laid back understanding makes class fun light work load and you actually learn reviews are exactly what is on the test nothing will blind side you attendance is not mandatory but i enjoy being there this goes for any class she teaches taken her any chance i get
4.5,W,she is an amazing professor her lectures are clear concise and entertaining you can tell she is genuinely excited about what teaching she is also very smart the readings are important in this class as are the lectures which you want to miss
4.5,W,she is the best professor ever seen her lectures are so organised and clear excluding using too many ornate vocabs
3.0,W,overall a good teacher but really distracting and irritating when she uses a lot of obscure words especially since heard her use those words incorrectly or mispronounced them
4.5,W,she is fantastic speaks clearly and gets all the concepts across in a stimulating environment i was unfortunate to only have her for the first semester as she went on mat leave as the other prof nearly as good if you have her you will not regret it
5.0,W,love favorite teacher ever she is the sweetest organized classes and notes cares for her students easy to approach and talk with her tests are easy if you take good notes during class
4.5,M,great teacher everything he tests on is in his lectures that he has for you on his website extremely helpful and has the best interest in the students if you make the effort he will go the extra mile for you some of the information is a bit dry but if you put in the time you will learn so much seriously awesome teacher tough class though
3.5,M,his lectures are so long and the lecture notes that he reads off of are filled with too much information that we even need to know he clearly specify what to know on exams and his exams have too many true and false questions which throw us all off a professor with a lot of knowledge but he should change some things
5.0,M,rose is a very good teacher he is clear helpful friendly and gives you everything you need to get an a he types out all the lecture material for you and as long as you know everything on that you will get an a but he is tough expect to spend several days studying for each exam and lectures are long
5.0,M,mr rose brings the world of the unseen to life in his microbiology class his attention to detail in lecture and lab is impeccable by the end of the course i feel that i knew a lot about infectious disease working with bacterial cultures in lab and safety mr rose is a kind and caring professor while maintaining rigor and professionalism
2.5,M,loves to hear himself talk lectures are very long and boring he goes over every lab and film you watch thoroughly before you do the lab or watch the film which completely takes all the fun and curiosity out of it very redundant he will repeat things over and over again like you are a kindergartner and comprehend not my favorite class
4.0,W,i have never read so much in my life so much reading and quizzes every class i took her one day a week class and it was so hard for me to keep a good grade a great professor and is passionate about the subject our class was really fun but she is a hard grader would not recommend taking her one day a week class unless you have to take it
4.5,M,great teacher funny down to earth made the class very enjoyable and relatable he wrote the book himself which made it very useful
1.0,W,if you are finance student or actually interested in knowing finance i suggest you take luther although she acts as if she knows what she is talking about she talks too fast and jumps over the whole topic i barely understood anything in her class also her grading criteria is not very clear
5.0,W,amazing teacher she made me love to class and not a lot of teachers do that she makes education fun when really not and she teaches you the best way and all of the criteria unlike other lazy professors i recommend kathy but at the same time a lot of people are getting to know the best so my advice is pray get in her class
5.0,W,kathy i love her so much i took photo and with her and she is such a fun enthusiasts teacher if you take her hybrid class be prepared for lots of videos and lab work outside of class really heavily focused on pushing you to your next and best level i have taken any other teacher photo she was the best ever
4.0,W,kathy is an amzing professor she cares about her students but participation is a must following directions is key to this class and it is an easy a if you do what is required she gives feedback and if you follow it you will succeed i would take her class again in a minute
4.0,M,hyde is by far the best professor had at spscc his criminology class was extremely interesting and i learned a lot from him the lectures could sometimes be dull but he would tend to tell personal stories to liven things up the homework load was minimal and we hardly ever used the book in class you need to take a class with hyde
4.5,M,genius sorry david is a hottie to bad i will never have a class with him again
4.5,M,this is my second quarter with hyde his class is easy but heavy on lectures there are no tests and the only assignments are weekly discussion posts and a final paper its pretty easy and an interesting class
4.5,M,professor potter is the best instructor had he makes every class fun and really knows what talking about make sure you read the book to pass the midtermfinal even though he gives you a study guide highly recommend this class enjoy
4.5,M,mr potter is a great teacher even though that not easy he only does midterm and finals he also does class paper attendance and chapter presentations
5.0,W,a pleasure to have this professor very precise helpful and a great sense of humor would take her again
5.0,M,wonderful professor taught me everything i needed to know to work as a forensic psychologist in a prison he knows his material from working in the real world a wonderful change from boring professors that only teach theory and of the best if not the best professors i ever had
4.0,M,professor bltiz is a great professor he really makes class interesting and great he does have quizzes which i found kind of ridiculous as they were a bit tough but make sure you do all his readings and homework and you will pass the class and his quizes also participate and actually try its all worth it
3.5,M,a good teacher he really cares about everyone teaching and gives over some valuable life skills and tips also very interesting teacher funny
3.5,M,he could be a little tough but if you pay attention to what is being taught and make the effort to correct your errors it will definitely boost your grade and get a higher grade in class
5.0,M,has a good rep and right he is amazing told us first day that he bore us but not allowed to bore him better do your work tho great prof
5.0,M,i had professor b for classes and now a obviously i think he is a great teacher if you do the reading and writings on time and participate you can do well a lotta reviews say he is scary which i totally get but mainly because he wants you to work hard he also does not tolerate foolishness
5.0,M,i loved professor blitz i took a class with him and professor sarna and it was amazing granted a lot of work so expect that but he makes the content fun and is able to relate to the students great professor and if an isp class you need a textbook
4.5,M,he made us think about multiple futures he made everyone give mini lectures in the semester i still believe he connected microscopes to time machines to multiple infinities and lose me hardest class ever best class ever wish i could take him every semester
2.5,M,not a bad teacher just a tough subject although he can be hard to understand sometimes you have to pay attention because he does not really review past lectures if you miss classes chances are you wont do so well on the tests
4.0,W,you have to work really hard in order to be successful in this class by the way she gives many paragraphs and stories to read each class after that you have to provide a response of the story there are many paper that has been given each class so you have to be really responsible of keep track of all of your stuff and work
2.5,W,she chooses monotonous books to read about court session criminals and jury on top of that she gives a little time to read pages for example days and students must analyze and bring citations with typed responds we should have a spare time on weekend should not we
5.0,M,prof curtis is hilarious he says yo a lot xd lol his class is really easy it consists of papers to write and no tests and the book that you must buy is really cheap overall his class was hilarious he is easy going and really cool be afraid to speak to him and show your personality easy grader highly recommended
5.0,M,great professor very knowledgeable in what he teaches class is never dull learned a pile from his class definitely would retake
5.0,M,keep up with the discussion boards answer the entire question and comment on othe posts and pj will get full credit he posts very interesting comments no midterm no final page paper at end of course
4.5,W,prof kaplowitz is an amazing professor she makes you read a lot though if you like to read bother taking her class quizzes are done either before every class or every other class i hated reading god knows i still do but she makes you read interesting novels that will have you wanting to know next do the work guaranteed a
2.5,W,if you want to hurt your gpa then you can take her she is horrible a quiz in every class and the final paper is to pages

5.0,M,he is a great teacher he tells you how it if your work is crap he will let you know if you handle it in the wrong major camilo is funny great helper take notes and you are fine he is very inspirational he does have a accent but you can understand him do not show up late to his class do not miss any days either
2.5,M,camilo was a great teacher i enjoyed his class a lot it was just a lecture but i learned a lot his accent is thick but if you try you can understand him he even sat down with me and outlined my entire class course for the rest of my dutchess career just show up to class and do the work pass if you ask for help its there funny guy too
2.5,M,an ok teacher not the best if looking for order and methods he tends to freestyle and work different projects year round an all around good person and a really tough grader his group projects is what brought me down took a different class and have nearly aced it group projects beware
1.5,W,nice but her way of teaching is blah everything she does is by the math department her answer to everything is literally on the syllabus if you want to pass and actually understand take another professor
1.0,W,the worst professor ever had she can be a teacher she know how explain anything my advice choose another professor
1.5,W,she is very nice and likable as a person but her teaching style is very difficult to follow along speaks very fast with us she has to go by the departmental syllabus she only shows us a few problems its hard to ask questions tests have nothing to do with class work or mymathlab also i think the mastery worksheets are given too much
5.0,W,a good proffesor if your interested her test are difficult but just preparing you for what you have to take next
1.0,W,she sucks at teaching math if your not good at math choose her not helpful at all and she explain anything well she goes way to fast she seem to be interested in helping students excel the worst beware choose her please
1.0,W,she only does the easy problems on the board when u get the worksheet u know what to do the test r harder than anything she teaches she closes her eyes when she lectures and has an attitude sometimes also very impersonal take her class cause u will fail she makes her assistant wait outside till the end of class like a dog
1.0,W,professor green is one of the worst mathematics professors i have ever had she is almost always tardy to her own class but will reprimand those students who come in after her even when she is minutes late ask her for help or clarification and she will laugh at you claims exams come from the department so you blame her for failing bad
1.0,W,take her
5.0,W,take her she gives a few concept notes and examples on the board point out a mistake and she is cool about it mostly work on handouts with people you sit with while she walks around and helps her teaching style is to let you figure things out while she guides you few graded homeworks she has a turkish accent but is very understandable
4.5,W,dr dogru was extremely helpful all semester long at first i thought her accent was going to be difficult to understand but i quickly adapted she is one of my favorite teachers it is fairly easy to do well in her class as long as you pay attention there isnt much homework and the tests are straight forward
3.0,M,i loved professor arminio although he is tough because he wants students to understand that college supposed to be easy but he is kind funny and when he lectures he takes his time to make sure concepts are understood he expects you to do a lot of studying on your own however would take again so sad that he is retiring
5.0,M,super good professor i really loved what he taught and how passionate he was about it retired now but leaving a review out of pure gratitude he rocks
3.5,M,arminio is a competent if not charismatic professor old school bone-dry and clear-cut in his teaching style nothing flashy there to teach not to entertain type of educator he does care for his students but his sense of humor is as dry as his teaching style you will learn but just try to take some of his comments with a grain of salt
3.0,M,he tells you what you general things for tests and gives handouts pop quizzes are on vocab that you have to define from the book and really random he tells you the class before to study he offers help when it comes to tests study everything and know little details especially for short response questions tough grader no extra credit
5.0,M,awsome teacher he prepares you very well before you take the exams everything that he teaches you will be on the test willing to help if you need it funny and loves to joke around
3.0,M,read your book and teach yourself a great teacher and he explains the material clearly after already taken the test the only test that actually reviews material already covered in class is the final by then too late people out of stayed in his course til the end sure not the only one who failed
2.0,M,watched him kick a mentally handicapped man out of his class before he turned to the mom and said try to back me in a corner a disgusting man and the people who think funny know when being insulted he loves to fail students makes him feel powerful withdraw you for challenging to hate science
5.0,M,so sweet i had to study more than for my other classes but i do not regret it at all always be present for class miss more than two classes and out no joke he will week out the weak ones so if looking for an easy professor look else where
5.0,M,honestly my favorite professor at mdc tough but also so sweet let his biker exterior fool you
5.0,M,as a person at mdc he is the greatest as a teacher he is the toughest he is very funny but his test are even funnier if you do not study must put a lot of time into this class and attendance will cause you to fail if you are tardy or absent a lot he will help you during office hours as well very lovable
4.5,W,i honestly loved this class if interested in learning english i recommend her if your taking it just to get it over with i still recommend her because she is there to help you if you need it and the work is more than manageable
2.5,W,unprofessional talks down to students not helpful rude lecture material is not a good reflection of what will be on the exams students and clinical patients complained about her attitude demeanor and overall lack of professionalism
5.0,M,great professor take his time to explain the course really down to earth wish i could take him again pass with an a
5.0,W,amazing very clear easy work would recommend very nice give a lot of extra credit take advantage i would definitely choose her as my professor again tests are super easy and you have so much extra credit always pass
4.0,W,professor lourdes is a great teacher she cares about you gives test but very simple tries to be funny and the homework is very simple and its online i recommend any one to take her you do not need the textbook but you do need the access code
4.0,W,this is the best math professor ever had i had to take this class because i failed three times how bad i was doing at math now i got an a on her class she is clear teaches step by step gives lots of extra credit and gives an online review before every test tests are exactly like those reviews i would take her again
4.5,W,shes a great teacher she takes some getting used too but she makes you work for the grade she gives plenty of extra credit so take use of it at first she seemed harsh but i came to see she is actually a really good professor
5.0,W,professor espana honestly tries to help everyone she gives a lot of opportunities of extra credit and she cares about her students take her it will be the best thing ever done honestly make sure you study she will help you but you must try
5.0,M,inspirational professor and interesting course he has a lot of experience working in the ehs field and he brings real work to lecture
2.5,W,the lectures were so terribly boring she was very unhelpful when i asked questions and seemed more bothered by my inquisition than anything else would not recommend
4.0,W,heather is awesome not easy but she is not that hard either if taking modern theory make sure to read everything in order to get a high grade every point counts because she grades right down to the the readings are dry and horrible but she makes the best of it and keeps you engaged make her like you a good networking contact
3.0,M,kaufman is down to earth and willing to provide help if you need it to be honest his intro to philosophy class is the most difficult for me so far because its very systematic and imaginative learning i do not recommend taking this class early in the morning because he solely lectures and drags on for the whole minutes leaving me tired
2.0,M,extremely boring and drawn out was quite condescending and rude at times although he gives decent study guides the tests are still quite hard although i will say that there is no homework aside from readings that are covered in class that being said i still was not a huge fan
2.5,M,his voice just that interesting and he seems to daydream into space a lot i found myself getting distracted because i focus on what he was teaching the subject itself is pretty complex and therefore i personally need an enthusiastic funny teacher especially in the morning
2.5,M,his voice just that interesting and he seems to doze into space a lot i found myself getting distracted because i focus on what he was teaching the subject itself is pretty complex and therefore i personally need an enthusiastic funny teacher especially in the morning
4.0,M,so passionate about the subject and his students just a really good professor
5.0,M,he is one of the nicest and humble people i have ever met he very helpful with papers attentive to his students and funny do the readings and show that you are working hard and you will get a good great
4.0,M,class is super easy if you take the time to memorize the map quizzes they are basically an easy grade he also gives tons of extra credit and he gives free questions on each exam definitely take this for an easy a
2.5,W,homework is like and the tests are like trying to put together a spaceship with a toothbrush and silly string good on but horrible in class lectures teach to save her life she is helpful when you ask but you have to ask questions
2.0,W,very difficult to understand notes concepts are not explained in simple terms seems like she thinks we are already supposed to be chemists or something
1.5,W,tests are nothing like the practice problems homework does not correlate with tests in the slightest bit notes make sense labs she is helpful but it
2.5,W,her tests are impossible the class work and homework comes off as easy but the test are on a whole new level
2.0,W,her notes make sense while studying calculations on test are immensely harder than what she teaches in class has trouble explaining things a kind woman who will try and help
4.5,W,prof miller is probably one of the best professors had in college incredibly nice helps you when you need it and too serious about her class her lectures are pretty helpful and you can tell she genuinely cares that her students understand her material definitely take her if you can
4.5,W,dr miller is the best she makes chem so understandable for non-chem majors her office door is always open if you need help but for the most part her lectures are easy to follow and the homework really helps prep for tests also effort does not go unnoticed in her class even if it is a large class take her if you can
1.0,W,she is mainly interested in male students and seems to flirt and make advances at men
1.0,M,worst teacher in the entire planet you will not learn anything about self defense he will keep pushing his business on students and will gladly fail you for no reason at all this teacher will be more than happy to kill your gpa if you come late once he will close the door on you then it is an automatic c worst worst teacher ever
5.0,M,ian kinder is a great professor his teaching methods are accurate and helps you in the long run this class will prepare you to defend yourself in various ways you will have fun in this class for sure
3.5,W,dr iftode is great if you ever need help she is more than willing to assist you the assignments can get a little tough but certainly learn a lot from her if interested in the material
4.5,M,professor conti is equally impressive as an educator as he is a cool dude he bs bs probably even in his vocabulary extremely down to earth but a tough grader as long as you do literally everything he expects you too you will get at least an a he hand out easily but he is a fair grader
5.0,M,great teacher not for the faint of heart he can be abrasively constructive in his criticism we wrote briefly every class as long as you put forth effort he was willing to help pretty funny guy and his assignments are straight forward no bull sure he hates me for my nuclear fission paper but too bad i hope he sees i said that too
5.0,M,pretty easy class he just wanted you to put effort forth had him once a week hes so awkward and funny you just wanna hug him
4.5,M,he is the best professor i have ever taken beware he is a tough grader and makes you work hard but he is easy to understand he cares for students as long as you care incorporates hip hop into his lessons sometimes which is cool we watched breaking bad in his class he teaches you everything he changed the way i think he changed my life
4.0,M,conti was such an amazing professor because he attacks the real problems of the world and allows us to break those barriers in class in the hours i had him a weak because i took a hybrid i learned about current events how to write and general knowledge i need to succeed in life conti was a life-changing professor
5.0,M,prof sierra is an interesting man nonetheless he is pretty awesome definitely knows his stuff always there for me when i emailed him regarding essays show up to every class on time he hates ppl who are late complete all essays on time and do your best on the quizzes overall if you can write essays you can get an a fun class for sure
1.5,M,i wanted to take foster but ended up taking sierra he is very rude he talks so fast during his lectures making it difficult to keep up write down everything u need he asks the stupidest smallest details about a movie or person on the test he criticizes this generation so much talks to u like ur an idiot show up dare use ur phone
5.0,M,i had this professor years ago for english and one of the theater arts film classes he was the best his film noir class was so much fun and i still remember it fondly almost ten years later because now a huge tcm classic film fan his classes were easy as and he allowed us to do revisions on papers
5.0,M,an amazing professor unfortunately i did not take his theater arts class but was an amazing class as we all know professor sierra said that he is not going to teach anymore however it was great pleasure to be in his class hated when some mentally challenged students used their phones for texting was crystal clear and very funny
4.0,M,he is a hilarious and pretty sarcastic in a funny way professor very knowledgeable thus this has made my lesson very interesting you are allowed to bring your laptops for notes during the exams lectures are important and one research paper no code required for textbook gets annoyed by people who uses their cellphone in during the movies
4.0,M,prof sierra is a nice outgoing professor who expects good papers from students essays w clear instructions be sure to do analytical instead of reiterating plot intro paragraph thesis paragraph body paragraphs and conclusion paragraph quizzes are okay two books he assigned can be found online pdf for free good luck
5.0,M,taken both of his film classes and he really knows about the genres and films he is talking about also if you plan on not coming to class and have no interest in film take this class why would you not want to come to a class where you watch just watch films the essays are not even hard because he lays out the parts that he expects
3.5,M,i took the online summer option for this class be prepared to work hard listen to lectures and read the textbook but if you do that you will pass his test are fair if you are self motivated then this is a good class for you
2.5,M,i did not do well with this class at all it was a week course and it was way too much to handle familiarize yourself with the material but make sure you memorize it like i did the tests were multiple choice but confusing as well as it was the biggest percentage of your grade and only tests i will never take him again
1.0,M,the worst experience i have ever encountered with a professor he never answered my emails or questions he waited until the last possible minute to upload or grade anything meanwhile his folders were stocked with files that dated back to most unorganized class ever and so unhelpful
2.0,M,honestly one of the laziest professors i have ever encountered took him for an online course and not only was he awful in replying back his folders are so clustered that material from is still uploaded a final project worth points due on the last day of the course was uploaded by him the day before would never take him again
4.0,M,richardson is my favorite professor at quinnipiac i would take this class again if i could it was tough and a lot of memorization but i have never felt as accomplished as i did after his exams he is such an amazing person and so inspiring this class is a must take for biology majors
1.0,M,belittles his students class not worth taking
1.0,M,belittles his students appears nice but he care about his students
5.0,M,professor looney has great knowledge in astronomy while he can explain them in a super easy way in an elementary class he taught this class with great passion and great illustration this class is definitely fun to take if you are interested in further knowledge that this class cover hesitate to ask him great teacher
5.0,W,one of my favorite teachers taken i actually took her last semester but i liked her enough that i thought everyone should still know awesome she is clear on the work and you go over it in class i taken her for as well if she offered it
4.0,W,i found professor wager very helpful she does have a specific way she wants you to write but does make it clear after the first few assignments she helped me with brevity but wanted me to change my writing style to match the way she liked it she was a decent professor and is very willing to help
1.0,M,listened to everyone on here not sure how this guy still has a job unreal requirements that would not apply in the real world all based on what he wants to see not what is logical even if work is correct it has to be done in his ridiculously specific manner in order and you will still lose points avoid at all costs
1.0,M,both books outdated one by years he did not explain his way on how to turn in assignments properly explanation for everything is repetition of syllabus and reread open days is required to meet he insulted students and scares students from giving instruction on discussion board the download is provided to him
1.0,M,horrible instructor wish i had looked him up before taking his class change to another instructor immediately deducts points like going out of style fully functioning solutions with documentation deducted points for unclear technicalities
1.0,M,hands down worst teacher ever drop now he is not helpful and takes joy in handing out consider yourself warned
1.5,M,drop this class immediately absolutely will not teach anything that is not needed for the assignments flat out said he answer my question about something in the textbook because we need it for any assignments you are better off buying the book and using stackoverflow for your questions
1.0,M,easily the worst teacher ever had his idea of teaching was just read the book he would look for any excuse to give on assignments i got one on the assignment of the semester not because it was late but because i sent it as attachment in email instead using blackboard it seemed to me like he was only there to collect a paycheck
1.0,W,by far the most condescending mean disrespectful and downright rude professor ever of all the classes i have taken in my college career this was the absolute worst very unclear instructions not to mention ridiculous amounts of outdated readings required do yourself a favor and do not take any classes by her you will regret it
1.0,W,do yourself a favor and do not take this class the papers that you will be directed to write will come with vague instructions when you follow the instructions guess what the rules change and you are penalized unfair grading vague descriptions topic jumping also vague you do not know how she arrives at your grade because its made up
3.0,W,class is intense omg i had to work my butt off for an a lots of papers to write her directions very clear bunch of discussion board posts to make to if you think this is a blow off class think again you have to put in alot of work for this teacher i managed to barely streak by with an a i been happy with a c in this class
5.0,W,her course is fairly intense so if you willing to do a research paper or read your textbook going to have a bad time the lecture tests were easy if you pay attention i did and the reading tests were easy if you read i if you write a good paper take good notes and read the book you should be fine
3.0,W,this class is not easy you have to work your butt off to get an a there are so many papers to write and she grades them pretty tough her directions very clear either you also have alot of discussion board posts to make you have to put in alot of work for this teacher as long as you do all the work on time you will pass
1.5,W,do not take if looking for an easy a she makes you work for it and i still even made a b doing all i could she is passionate about human rights and i liked reading her writings about it but the only thing i liked she is really bad about being clear about directions and waits till the last second to point out an issue with your work
1.5,W,she assigns a lot of work but fails to tell you when it is due very unorganized you can pretty much teach yourself the class as all she does is read the packets she gives you quizzes every week and usually behind schedule communicate good with students take someone else if you can
1.0,W,do not take this teacher if you want to learn spanish she is extremely hard to understand and is horrible at teaching concepts i barely made a b because i took spanish in high school i was just rusty also she is extremely boring and monotoned i do not recommend her
5.0,W,dr hon is an amazing human being she is someone you would want in your life even as a friend pr research with her was great super helpful willing to work with you and she was extremely understanding i wish she taught another course to take her again
5.0,W,she is great very helpful and so enthusiastic about her job she made the class very fun to be in has quizzes about what you talked about in the class the day before has great study guides as well
1.0,M,so confusing because he says he wants you to be creative but then shoots down your ideas he tells you exactly how he wants it done even though its your art no real free will in the class you basically are only learning his style of art
4.5,W,i loved her as a professor really nice woman tests hard although the essays can be difficult but take it to her office hours and have her read it she will tell you what needs to be fix gives opportunities for extra credit here and there
5.0,W,professor was an awesome and easy professor four papers tests and the final which cumulative she is a pretty easy grader majority of the class got on papers class mandatory she just lectures about the book so you can just read the book instead really easy class no homework either
2.5,W,dr branch was a difficult teacher to work with although she was helpful when it came to projects the answers were usually vague and not direct when grading i felt as if she graded based off of personal opinion rather than the facts that were clearly on the paper helps you to become a good writer but not a great one
5.0,W,i took almost everything that branch taught guilford college a few years ago i thought that she was the most thought-provoking engaging scholar she was also very approachable and genuinely invested in the success of her students she inspired and still inspires me to go deeper novels articles other forms of research were our textbooks
5.0,W,mima is a terrific teacher very helpful and treats her students with respect anyone who has her as a teacher is lucky
5.0,M,great prof he really made me think about life and how i think about things he challenged me to venture outside the box and question what i believe and why as objectively as i could really showed me how closed-minded i was this class is a must for first years essays hard just incorporate what he talks about in lecture read the books
4.0,M,great professor will be taking him again
3.5,M,dr kent is a very thorough professor he gives a ton of information and the tests can be difficult as long as you study the essay questions and notes an a is possible he gives a lot of extra credit on every test highly recommend
5.0,W,gel is really a great teacher knows the material backwards and forwards but has a way with personalizing the material as well she knows what like to be a student will certainly take more classes with her
4.0,W,if you do not like to be picked out in front of everyone do not take the class she has favorites and uses them to demonstrate and calls them out it can get very frustrating
5.0,W,wonderful professor certainly cares about her students and does anything she can to help them learn and grow as long as they are willing to put forth the effort this class will better you as a dancer and a performer and you will learn more than you anticipated sure you regret taking a class with gel great
3.0,M,he is willing to chat about the material and help you however half the time his answers make sense course has non-cumulative midterms a group presentation and the take home final is two essays he can be frustrating and unclear but good lecture overall
4.0,M,not sure why ian gets such a bad rep he is not a super interesting prof but just show up to class and do other class work while there you need to pay attention if you read the textbook instead non-cumulative midterms and a final project questions answered in essay form
4.5,W,professor carr is one of the best professors i have had thus far she is extremely open minded and loves to hear your opinion regardless of her agreeing with it as for people complaining about the amount of books and reading you can get her books cheaply online and complain about reading when you are in a literature class that is silly
4.5,W,this is my second time taking her class and she is a spectacular teacher her class is heavily dependent on assigned readings and class discussions but overall is rather chill as she is very open-minded you have to buy a lot of books so expect to spend quite a bit of money if not much of a talker do expect your grade to suffer though
2.0,W,dr davis is nice enough but she is unbelievably hard was pretty interested in political science prior to taking her class but now will never take another one really tough papers with very vague prompts avoid her fys at all costs
1.0,W,i would recommend this teacher to no one ever takes a month to grade assignments she takes two weeks to respond to emails then be to late because the assignments due date has passed and nothing she will do you just have to take the loss you never get a straight answer the class itself is fine but the teacher is not for you
3.5,M,kurt is a great guy most labs will be in the optics room and will take some time to complete best not to procrastinate in case you have questions he has office hours but welcomes walk-ins book is a must and you have to have high discipline hard grader but he is just giving an honest rating of how much you really understand
5.0,M,hard test grader but he wants you to know as much as possible
1.0,M,kurt is a very boring lecturer he does a lot of talking about advanced geology and his research but forgets that this is an introductory geology and we really know all that much about it he likes to put up pictures and explain them in complex details before we even understand the words he says
1.0,M,the hardest easy a you will ever get sitting through this class is absolute torture i do not understand how someone who does so little can still be a professor do not take his class the a is not worth
2.0,M,if looking for an a this was an easy class but also because we had almost no assignments there were times he show up material was irrelevant a nice dude and clearly smart but he care about undergrads and taught us literally nothing if you actually want to know urban soc do not take the class with him
3.0,M,i was very uneasy as to how grading will be and i cannot lie waiting for my grade made me very anxious as a professor def not the best as an advisor he is phenomenal and keeps things real unless ready to be fully engaged i would avoid taking him but he is great to talk to
3.0,M,really confusing and slow often goes on random or semi-random tangents the class progresses really slowly as he randomly comments on students who say something walk in late or are just sitting minding their own business like to emphasize the slowness november and our test was this past monday no assignments though
1.0,M,i take him again nice but that is really the only positive use a textbook or any type of supplementary material during class and very hard to understand comes up with his own examples to present material and the class is left guessing whether or not his work on the board is correct grading is very vague
3.5,M,tough class to pass a little hard to understand him at first but not after a few sessions he makes some hilarious jokes in class dr khanal allows you to replace your lowest test grade with your final grade if higher final multiple choice gives partial credit on everything quizzes are easy and test are kinda hard give extra credit
4.5,M,this professor loves teaching and he complicate the class if you understand he will teach you again and will consider your difficulties on the test this is the kind of teachers who cares about your gpa and you learning i would take another class professor he earned his salary
3.5,M,a good professor after you get used to him it takes about the first week to get over his accent but if you can deal with that then be fine in the class he goes over all the material really well and gives good reviews for tests homework is fairly simple and he grades with lots of partial credit on tests overall pretty good
2.0,M,professor lecker is an expert on canadian literature he makes a real effort to help his students succeed not at all an easy class and it really depends on the tas that grade your exams i enjoyed the class and would suggest it to friends remember not an easy a you need to put in the work in order to do well
2.0,M,most boring uninteresting painfully suicidal class ever do not take if you like to think freely and interpret literature the way it is supposed to be-subjective he wants you to think like him so in the end you are only pleasing the prof zero motivation and interest to attend his class most people are bored to death
2.5,M,very boring class pretends to want to get to know you but he secretly wants you to think just like his interpretations lectures are painful to get through
4.5,M,he is awesome grades are only tests attendance is but i recommend you attend every class because he explains the information thoroughly he gives out lecture notes a few days before the exam memorize it and do good his tests are short answer but some require only one word answers he is soo funnnnyy i am def taking him again
4.0,M,i took his class and enjoyed it he gave curves and i got a b without studying much you really have to listen in class and take notes very intelligent guy he makes a few jokes which are missed by most of the class
4.0,M,extremely interesting class explains things well tests arent easy but he cuts a lot of slack int he grading your grade is just your tests so if you dont do well on one tests get a bad grade on the course
5.0,M,i took both physiological psych and human neuropsych with prof kurylo and both classes were amazing he is very sarcastic which makes the learning fun pay attention in class read the assigned chapters and you should do well smart guy take him
2.5,M,if you want to be happy then take him a nice man but basically an independent-study his tests even in english
3.5,M,abramov was great he was easy to understand his lectures were easy to keep up with and hilarious read the chapter before class and do great only tests no midterm and they are multiple choice questions taking the final on monday fairly confident read the chapters textbooks in the reserves and participate pass
5.0,M,every professor should be like professor kozbelt he was hands down my favorite teacher in college i still miss his class one year later yes stats is a challenging class but for people going into this field and wishing to succeed challenges need to be overcome this teacher will fully equip you with what you need if you want to do well
2.0,M,lectures are scattered and his explanations of concepts are very vague i did not know what developmental sociology was until our ta explained it halfway through the semester he uses examples that are not thought out and you could argue that all choices on his multiple choice questions are correct even so the class is super easy
5.0,M,very dry lectures just show up and understand what he is saying all assignment are tutorials on database he is very easy going mid term final very easy grader class is on basic like triggers big data database sap hana and a little mongo db
4.5,W,a nice person gives her time to students who utilizes office hours hard coursework and a lot of homework but doing it really helps with the exam pick if you can allot enough time for it
5.0,M,this class felt like my high school math classes you have homework assigned every night but not a lot if you need help he loves to help kind of a goofy guy so the class is a little bit more enjoyable for a math class i would recommend him to anyone
4.5,M,i speak for all when i say this professor is just amazing on my point of view he is not only a professor but also an advisor who wishes nothing more than the best in your career
3.0,M,professor strong is a good man who genuinely cares about hes students the test are hard because he doesnt want students to memorize the material but to understand how it works he get nicer as the semester progress so dont give up quickly for example he starts giving reviews for test broad reviews but they do help if you do the work study hard and come to class theres no need to worry
5.0,M,not a class for people who want to work if you want to sleep through class or expect him to give away grades choose a class that you can pass without learning he will explain concepts over and over until everyone understands take him if you want to succeed in nursing
3.5,W,winn is clearly a professor who knows her material her course is not too hard but not to easy you definitely earn the grade given very fair and very helpful if lost with the material help without hesitation
4.0,W,great teacher great lecturer you can tell she lives and breathes the material which is pretty inspiring loved her class too bad she teach political theory on the regular
5.0,W,anyone seriously interested in political theory should take dr condit her class intellectually challenged me more than any other i do wish however that she had been more clear about which readings we would be tested on both the reading scheduled and study guides she posted would have assigned readings that just show up on the tests
5.0,W,marlos is a great instructor she has a wealth of knowledge and i always learn a lot in all of the classes i take with her the friendliest professor in the department
3.5,M,i took dr urbn course online over the summer dr cooke is pretty knowledgable and it was an interesting course there was no textbook and he just had you do assigned readings on huskyct your grade was based on writing assignments and your comments on other assignments and he dropped your two lowest scores
3.0,M,overall this class was petty no textbook and slides are posted online before class however you will still need to go to lecture in order for you to know his anecdotes or opinions that he often puts on the exam the material was not hard however it was not fun and can become time consuming cooke is a funny professor tho
1.5,M,a very unhelpful professor who prefers breaking up into groups four times in one class than actually teaching said during office hours that he does not give full credit at all he is highly knowledgeable but just a little odd man on a power trip
5.0,M,extremely helpful professor he is very committed to his students and he is always there to offer his help he is the best professor ever i would take again and i highly recommend him
5.0,M,by far the best professor had the privilege to have at denison so enthusiastic about biochemistry and he will do whatever it takes to help you even if that requires him losing sleep his understanding and willingness to help really made me want to do well in this class if you get the chance take a class with him
5.0,M,dr kuhlman is probably one of the best professors at denison he is the nicest professor i have had here and will do everything in his power to make sure you understand what you need to know he even goes the extra mile and tries to help based on how you learn will take him again and maybe even another time after that
4.0,M,the professor is very friendly and loves to give to give students life lessons the class can be boring at times boring because he loves to bounce around topics anatomy to life as for the exams quizzes and labs they are very easy best advice memorize everything and beware of falling behind in anatomy otherwise it will bite you in da ass
5.0,W,dr asplin has to be one of the best professors at upg she is a wonderful professor and cares about her students dr asplin even cares about her students outside of her classroom and is easily accessible to her students i am glad i took her for classes while i attended pitt greensburg she was helpful when i took this course
3.0,W,i do not remember the course code but the course was a level and was intro to american legal systems she was very cool and down to earth she is not one of the professors who think that because they have a degree they are better than you although the note taking can be confusing at times she is magnetic and i would recommend to anyone
4.0,W,a class with kate should be compulsory she will expand your mind and educate you with skills and knowledge that will reach far beyond the classroom her women and politics class was my favorite during my time at usm i carry the lessons learned with me in my life kate greene educator teacher inspiration
5.0,M,i love chris he is super nice and really wants to help you his class is easy if you actually work hard never had to work after hours or anything he helps you even if you ask him the same question a million times he seems genuinely concerned about you help you through any issues you have highly recommend
4.0,M,he made things clear in the class but if you thought that taking this class would be easy because of childrens books you were wrong near the end gets into young adult books that you read within a week sometime cram in a week if slow reader do not take research paper you should start early only test quiz every week
3.5,M,loved ian he is humorous and kind will get into conversations with you if interested his class is interesting to attend i recommend sitting in the front because a huge lecture hall the reading guide is slightly confusing but you can email the everyday and they will clarify highly recommend
4.5,M,dr ibrahim is a truly a great professor the material he covers easy but he makes sure that he explains it in a way in which the whole class will understand although the homework mandatory it really helps you grasp the main idea of the material and he also uses it as extra credit towards your final grade hard but not impossible
2.5,M,let personality get in the way of what saying brilliant stuff while he do email he was always available after class for questions or comments he was also very honest which hurts fragile students but i wish i taken lower level classes before this one because i felt lost half the time
2.0,M,he is a very intelligent man but should not be teaching undergrads on the first day he told us he does not give his e-mail address out to undergrads he had us second years reading anatomy of criticism among other difficult and dry texts his feedback on essays had lots of criticism but few suggestions for improving avoid him as a prof
5.0,M,you should choose to take professor courses because one of the few critical minds at the university of alberta who actually takes a bite out of reality the only issue is that professor bracken is so good at what he does that not only does he make other professors seem unqualified but he also reveals your own skill level
2.5,M,really likes his theory and expects you to apply it and know it well get discouraged if he acknowledge your comments in class keep asking questions if you make it through his course your other classes be as hard definitely worth it
4.0,W,debra is a good teacher she is going to help you if you are putting efforts never miss her any class because she always teach something interesting and important
5.0,M,dean for test paper everything u confused he can explain clearly he is a humourous guy and always sign for attendants for some special miss the class at the mid-time course is not that hard focus on details and tricks on the calculation he prepared
5.0,M,the way of his teaching makes stats easier and simpler
4.5,M,excellent professor tells u exactly what will come up on the mid-term and final assignments are straight forward the course is not that hard and he makes it even easier getting an a is not so hard provided you do weekly practice of the questions good luck
1.0,W,terrible professor learning latin would be clearer than listening to this lectures she is all over the place and does not explain anything well she gives paragraphs of instructions for an answer she expects to be a few sentences welcome to hell
1.0,W,horrible teacher her instructions are super long but clear at all one of the worst teachers i have ever had would rather just have a final test instead of written work during the semester
5.0,W,she is one of the best professors had at wmu she really knows her lectures and is extremely knowledgeable of her subject she is helpful and very respectful her tests are difficult so you will need to study a lot you can buy the book for practice problems but not mandatory i got an a and never bought the book
5.0,W,she is super awesome
5.0,W,awesome teacher the class is hard and there is a lot of material but if you go to class and take notes you will be fine she knows everything
1.5,W,lazy prof not helpful to tend to students questions not consistent with what she said would be covered on
4.5,M,professor giarratani was an excellent teacher he really knows a lot about econ and has a lot of real world experience which he brings into the classroom he worked with the white house on industrial policy negotiations with the chinese he has a great ability to get students to understand concepts and makes the material very clear
4.5,M,giarratani is awesome he has a boring voice that is true but he is very passionate about econ and you can really tell he throws in little jokes and stories to help make up for the tone of his voice he explains things really well i would definitely recommend him if you are deciding whether to take honors micro he changes your perspective
2.5,W,she can be rude to students and is a huge stickler for phones out in class and wandering out of the room aka no bathroom breaks if you want the stink eye also huge on arriving on time she takes attendance and if late she scolds you and sometimes gives pop reading quizzes which you take even if a few minutes late
2.5,W,unreasonable super boring class thinks her class is the only one taking forces you to change things that are perfectly fine
2.0,M,he is so confused the guy just has no idea how to teach there were many times when he would write a problem on the board realize he did it incorrectly and ended up erasing the whole thing and taking another minutes to reteach it and that was just one of the many problems in that class if you value you what learning do not take him
4.0,M,very great teach sad that he his leaving one of my favorite professors he is truly hilarious
3.5,M,mr curtright is a very good professor i have taken both world history classes and i loved them both he means business when it comes to studying and paying attention in class but he is funny and down to earth when you get to know him sadly the fall semester was his last one teaching at tcc going to miss his class
3.5,M,not the nicest guy but he is good at lecturing if you can make yourself pay attention during lecture and study you should be able to pass he gives outlines for lecture and the majority of his tests are the study questions on the lecture outlines not the best but certainly not the worst
1.0,M,this professor use the book yet he expects you to read every page he assigns the only grades he gives are for the four tests that hardly have anything to do with history or his lectures his lectures are dull and i have fallen asleep on many occasions in his class unless you want to be bored to death do not take him
1.0,M,unless you are a total history buff this class is miserable ive never made anything lower than a b and i failed and had to withdraw he drones is a jerk when you ask questions and the only grades come from tests which include written portion use board at all attendance is mandatory book and outline connect
3.0,M,history just not my area of expertise for some he drones i found his sidebar commentary to be comical however tests yielded questions to see how engaged you were during lecture and your ability to take quality notes went to office still improve grade all that i ask is that an instructor is fair and he is
5.0,W,professor dameron is an excellent professor if you do the work you will succeed professor dameron wants you to succeed she is very fair i took her online class and was quite please recommend her highly
5.0,W,professor dameron wants you to succeed you must do the work and put forth the effort if you do what she asks you will succeed great class and great professor
2.5,W,i got an a in the class but i hated going to class i dreaded it when we were in class we even talk about history majority of the time you have to read four chapter books and do a book review those are your tests if you read you pass the were a pain she gives so much info that it is hard to get ready for a quiz
5.0,W,she is an awesome teacher when asked for help she will give it her classes are always interesting and though she strays sometimes she always incorporates the topic of the day
3.0,W,morna is so very sweet i would love to talk to her about other matters than that of design or drawing a great person with a lovely smile but not exactly the best professor her directions for assignments are always different for each class it seems helpful but i think she always knows how to say what the best way to do something is
5.0,M,seriously in love with this is so helpful and caring best professor ever had i highly recommend him
5.0,M,s great professor who genuinely cares about his students he talks to people who talk to him so that can sometimes be misconstrued as favoritism he teaches organic a difficult subject very well real and does not beat around the bush which is nice
3.0,M,i thought i would be taking precalclus but apparently i am taking middle school math i am not in any way prepared to move onto calculus i next semester we spent more than half of this semester completing basic review and he even commented in class that we have spent three times the amount of time on review than the book recommended
2.5,M,extremely picky grader he takes points off for lack of punctuation on math problems he is easily agitated and has no problem talking down to people and making nasty or passive-aggressive remarks the worst part is that the material he teaches leaves you completely unprepared for the courses you need to take after avoid him
1.0,M,horrible teacher he was confusing and boring he graded weird really was not considerate if you did not understand dont take him
4.5,W,took this online as an weeker relatively easy class keep up with the work and you will be fine teacher seemed nice via emails had no other contact with her final project takes a while so get started early interesting course i enjoyed it
5.0,W,tressa is the kindest teacher in the department an easy grader and is very patient with people who struggle she is also just adorable in general such a kind-hearted person
5.0,M,burns is amazing if all people learned math from burns from start to finish we would all be math wizards give you the shirt off his back to help you out great guy and great professor i wish i could take more classes with him tests are easier than the homework labs help with understanding and boost your grade a great experience
5.0,M,awesome professor really knows his stuff
5.0,M,so i just want to say that burns is an awesome doubt about it his love of math makes the class interesting you know he enjoys what he does from the way he acts he is always smiling and is very easy going he has solved difficult problems in front of the class very impressive side is an avid player of chess pretty cool
5.0,M,best teacher every makes sure everyone understands before moving on he the only math teacher i have had that made math seem fun
5.0,M,great prof helped me through one of my toughest subjects math his explaining was alot better then the book he gave us
5.0,M,this professor is the best i have seen yet he cares so much about you passing the class that he will stop teaching just to make sure you get the problem correct he makes mathematics simple and fun there is no way you can leave this class confused or angry he always puts a smile on your face professors should learn his style of teaching
5.0,M,he is an amazing teacher i always struggled with math and thought i hated makes me excited about math and it is now my favorite subject he is one of those teachers you want to stay connected with the best
5.0,M,he is an awesome professor i ever have
5.0,W,brandie is one of the best professors at byu she makes you work for it but you cannot help but be completely engaged in her class and come away totally psyched about what you learned she is a hard grader with a lot of assignments but if not lazy taking her class will be one of the best academic experiences ever have
2.0,W,take this class unless already obsessed with shakespeare or a glutton for punishment dr siegfried is kind and brilliant but the course load is ridiculous the midterm take-home takes hours the reading is very heavy and she expects heavy annotation for each reading assignment
4.5,W,dr siegfried is the bomb her class goes beyond the text still using principles she taught me a year later and i always will a load of work but worth it read listen participate and get a good grade
1.0,M,understood him since day this was one of the hardest things ever done he explain the problem or how to do it just writes it straight out of the book and expects you to know it hope this helps you decide to not take this class
3.5,M,he is ok page essays exams exams are a bit tricky but not impossible if you study he canceled class a total of times nice guy he is alright
4.5,M,incredible professor and human being if you get a chance to take a class of his while at the college do it you regret it
3.0,M,i practically have to do the entire lab before class if i want to finish but he gives full credit regardless of how much you turn in quizzes are difficult
4.0,M,it was a lab class so mostly homework done in class he was very good at explaining the information though and was willing to help you as long as you tick him off with stupid questions be respectful and inquisitive and do fine
1.5,M,this was the worst professor ever had at gw seriously avoid him mean overly critical to students and just plain down rude if he like you he seriously scared me he was just that bad of a professor take another class because most likely you get an a or even a b in his class
1.5,W,if you take this class be prepared to write a lot linda is a harsh grader with the major assignments most of the assignments were a waste of time she is not helpful and her instructions are unclear she told me i had a good topic to write about and my summaries of articles were good but then tore apart my final paper take this class
5.0,W,linda is awesome this is the most interesting most fun and most relevant grammar class ever taken the best part about linda is that she thinks grammar is stupid so while she is teaching it she admits it has flaws and encourages discussion about brings in readings that challenge the idea of traditional grammar take this class
5.0,W,linda is so nice and so much fun this class really prepares you for all of your other college classes she will help you with anything and she is way funny too
5.0,W,took this class as a hybrid then needed to drop the class a few weeks in due to some schedule changes she is a great professor generates good discussion interesting and fun however as far as a course goes there is a lot of writing way more than other professors for several page papers due almost every week along with assignments
5.0,W,she is the best professor i have ever had she makes things incredibly clear and she teaches the simplicity of things without making you feel stupid she is so helpful if you understand something and she is very approachable i highly recommend this professor incredible
2.5,W,took her for crime media violence very charismatic and interesting funny dorky jokes propel the otherwise dull lectures very hard grader really tell you what you did to write on not the best not the worst
3.5,M,ted is incredibly knowledgable and well-prepared his lectures are very fast paced you need to take notes on a lot of what he says and not just rely on the powerpoints he posts on nyu classes he is not always clear but is willing to help
1.5,M,thank goodness for his ta who mark the papers very hard knows a lot but he teach clearly the lectures structured impossible to take notes not the hardest prof on planet earth but nothing special
4.5,W,deffinatly my favorite isom professor she gets students engaged in class and connects with you one-on-one available for help and if you understand something ask and clear things up and bring it to a level thats relatable to you you have to work for a good grade loved the class though
2.5,W,she thinks a good professor but her lectures are utterly pointless confusing and goes off on tangents that are irrelevant to the class material i would probably look for a different professor in retrospect because although i received an a it was a stressful level class and i learned nothing
1.0,W,tests are almost impossible her grading is extreme and so hard to understand avoid at all costs
1.0,W,horrible avoid at all costs her tests are impossible and this class is very intense for a level class
1.0,M,obvious that moran is very intelligent in this field but this is by far the worst class that i have taken at nyu he makes you write three page papers that are worth of your grade and participation is worth it is basically impossible to get an a he leaves rude comments that make you feel horrible terrible teacher and class
1.0,M,please for the love of god do not take this man he is rude comes up with outlandish course guidelines and is extremely condescending expect nice comments or constructive feedback just make sure to inhale as much breath as you can every day before class since his ego takes up most of the room look closely and not even smart
1.0,M,he is by far the worst professor i had at nyu he does not elaborate on what he actually wants to see on the paper and if you follow the protocol you get anything higher than a b or c i went to see him outside of class for the second paper and everything he told me to put on the paper was wrong when he returned it
1.0,M,worst professor i had at nyu by far always confused in class papers are absolute nightmares based on his crazy model they have no thesis and cause you to repeat yourself incessantly and then come to no conclusion his markings are very rude and his grading harsh impossible to meet with and gives days to write page papers awful
1.5,M,five weeks into the semester and never regretted taking a class more the comments he leaves on ungraded homework assignments are hurtful and upsetting they make me feel stupid do not take this class i listen to past reviewers do not make the same mistake i made unless you want to cry regularly beyond rude and terrible
2.5,M,lectures are a complete waste of time unfortunately he takes attendance so you have to go or get someone to sign you in are easy if you study and have a good ta the key to enjoying this class is having a good ta that being said professor moran is sweet and very understanding i recommend you take him you learn a lot
3.0,M,the guy is a complete ass he is rude to his students if you come in late need to use the bathroom or ask a question he makes a scene but it is an easy class he wont tell you your grade tho you should just know it
1.0,M,he grades really weird but there is enough opportunity for extra credit
4.0,W,very invested in her students will do anything to help them succeed
1.0,W,this prof talks to you like you are a child of not an adult of a joke been in something so juvenile since grade insulting learn a thing from her good thing students do her job for her she seem to respect students enough to talk to them as adults i pay thousands to be treated like avoid
5.0,W,she definitely has a way of making a room silent when she walks in she keeps order in the class and demands respect to visitors i enjoyed this class not much to it just show up and listen mainly others doing presentations she wont let you show up sign in and leave very observant i recommend this class if you are serious about psyc
4.0,M,dr neal is a very hard very nice teacher he is also one of my favorite people alive he is dedicated to the students and cares about them to the fullest he is always always open to emails meetings of any he is a very tough teacher however and be prepared to be challenged completely
1.0,M,terrible prof worst class ever had there was no point in attending class as he never talked about anything related to the course loses track of what he is saying and frequently has to read out of textbook or his notes refers too much to toronto area where he went to school tests are noone ever knew what to study students beware
4.0,M,professor cameron is a really enthusiastic guy he is so well learned and his lectures are never boring he really knows his stuff he is a really tough grader though i would get a b on his exam and he told me i did extremely consider a b an extremely good grade but he does focus on the topics he emphasized n on the exam
2.5,M,like his teaching style no power-point straight from the book not specific of what he wants in a paper lectures are long and mundane makes you wanna go to sleep gets distracted easily
2.0,M,terrible teacher he sells you his book for more than it is worth then his lectures and notes are not adequate for his exams his tests are harder than the material he gives he is arrogant and insulting thinks he is the greatest gift to the field of geography
1.5,W,has no real idea what she is teaching and has no industry insights to help the students grow into the job market complete waste of space
1.0,W,shes nothing but an arrogant airhead she loves listening to herself talk and acts surprised when no one follows the lecture
1.0,W,professor knows her stuff but chooses not to share with class in an easy and understanding way off topic in lecture tests are sporadic and the class is overall confusing do not recommend with her
2.0,W,she says reading the textbook is mandatory but waste your money or time attend lectures and take notes and be prepared to answer the most arbitrary facts on the tests all in all i do not recommend taking this course with her as the instructor
2.5,W,as a professor kelly was great her teaching style is fun and kept me interested the way the course was conducted was my struggle the first half of the course is heavy reading that is meant for someone who is an expert in the subject the books we read are much simpler in the second half class was mainly a lecture to confused faces
1.0,W,zahajko was the worst instructor i have ever had she chose favorite students had those students grade their classmates tests absolute violation of privacy there raced through her lectures called out the student she like in front of the whole class and was just plain rude i absolutely do not recommend her
2.0,W,this professor is a joke aced all my tests did every single homework assignment but was given a due to not being in class ever single day if you want to take a class that reminds you of high school then take her classes
1.0,W,if you taken spanish before then prepare to be behind on day one senora zahajko moves quickly and pause for more than a minute to help anybody out daily homework is heavy and she is unsympathetic if you miss an assignment very biased to her favorite students and will easily single you out if you fall behind
5.0,W,wang laoshi is honestly the best i am so glad i took chinese in mount holyoke because of all the amazing professors even though she is really busy wang laoshi as one of them is helpful clear caring and motivating she is just like our mom
5.0,M,professor panzarella is a very fair grader plus he is very well educated person i have learned a lot from the professor the class was very informative professor treats his students as adults very interesting course not that hard all you have to do is just read the texts loved this class
5.0,M,had a class with dr janz before and i took him again this semester a great professor not interested in religion at all and he explained everything so clearly and straight-forward that it was easy to remember and understand tests are mc essay plus he uses the canadian grading scale for an added bonus
2.5,M,pretty easy class but i also took years of chem in high school ap for one of those years his tests are really easy but he is a very picky grader boring lecturer but i thought that he explained things well
5.0,W,i have to admit class is not the easiest but its only because she wants to make sure you get the material for example i got a bad grade on our last test but i was able to make up the grade by making an appointment with her and teaching her how to do the ones i got wrong she is always available for extra help
2.5,M,he is so entertaining he is so funny but i felt like i did not learn all that much we had a lot of in class discussion and it was based mostly on the chapter reading for that week weekly discussion questions on myclasses he loves what he does and has a variety of experience which i thought was really cool
5.0,M,this class is not easy but dr nelson wants you to do well you will enjoy this class it turns into a botany family field trips every week a quiz each day you must keep up on your terminology nomenclature to do well this class requires work but is so rewarding dr nelson is awesome bio i think take one of his classes
5.0,W,super super easy class there is hardly any homework in this class basically what you finish in class is your homework she makes the assignments pretty short and easy she grade hard at all just show up and do the assignments and group work worth points but super easy then you will pass easily
4.0,W,extremely easy class just do the work dr wall is really nice and knows what she is talking about assignments were not hard unless not good with technology a lot of group projects
4.0,W,very easy class but she can be a bit rude class consists of busy work and a few projects which you will have plenty of time to do
5.0,M,vinnie is incredibly well-liked all over campus--and as soon as you take a class from him know why smart funny and pushes you to consider other points of view in a way that invalidate your own he respects your opinion as long as you can back it up will take more classes from him in the future
5.0,M,vinnie is the most amazing teacher i would definitely take his class again and respect him as a teacher and as a person
2.5,W,she is very passionate about the topics but more like she is trying to convince you to be passionate about it rather than teaches you about the topic she will ask you questions that no one knows the answers to because we gone over it and then expects us to know the answer
1.0,W,do not take this class from her if you do not have too she is not helpful her quizzes are very hard she will tell you to study the lab reports for the quizzes but then there will be things on the quiz that on the lab reports always follow her directions because she will take points off for everything
2.5,W,take her unless you can teach yourself outside of class a terrible teacer plus her monotone in sigh not the best teacher
2.0,W,she did not have grades uploaded on blackboard until the semester was over she told us weeks before school let out that we could make up assignments but at the time i had all then i look on after the semester ends and shes added lots of grades that are like and would have done some of that make up work if those grades we uploaded
4.5,W,ms maguire was great i took intro and she explained the material well she is obviously passionate about the subject and her enthusiasm made it interesting it is possible to do well if you do all assignments plus practice problems
1.5,W,she was an okay teacher the only thing i had a problem with was that i received an and she even make it an a which i thought was a little ridiculous considering it is only points and she would not round it up considering other teachers would raise your grade a whole point to give you an a she even round it up
5.0,W,wish i could take her for all accounting courses
5.0,M,took dr c for psychopathology and he was incredible he definitely easy but you learn a lot and he is extremely helpful and insightful also been my advisor and been awesome in that regard as well highly recommend taking him if willing to work hard want to learn
4.5,M,the lab is setup by el centro and he has no control over the tests which were difficult his lecture tests were straight from the powerpoint he didnt test on anything that he didnt cover he is very nice and wants you to make a good grade i wish he was teaching scit in the fall i would love to take another one of his classes
5.0,M,great teacher easy exams just study his powerpoints and you will pass with an a the lab quizzes are pretty tough but the biology department makes those you need a book and he will tell not to buy the recommended book
5.0,M,great teacher i wish he was teaching would highly recommend lab quizes are difficult but are made by the biology department he never tests on information he didnt cover in lecture gives a good review before most tests
3.5,M,i really enjoyed having this class with des a really smart guy and interesting to hear everything he has to say he always seemed to care about us as students and our opinions you could tell he wanted us to be successful sort of a quirky guy so not everybody liked him no such thing as a perfect paper
4.0,M,as inspirational as he is hilarious and one of the few people to truly challenge my writing capacities i went to him for advice on an assignment topic and he provided me with a mini lecture on the subject his lectures might seem vague but he prefers to generate thought rather than telling you what to think
4.0,M,at times dr harding can be a little all over the place he is really interested in his teaching though and he really wants to motivate and excite his students as well he is a very nice guy and is always willing to talk and help his students he does grade a bit touch and there are quite a few assignments overall though not a bad class
1.0,M,absolutely awful experience in the class i always felt as if i was drowning and he did little to help when i asked questions he has a way of giving you an answer without actually answering anything and leaving you more confused than when you asked the question in the first place
4.0,M,des knows his stuff and he expects you to work hard he once told me he thinks of himself like a captain of a ship whose sole mission is to get from point a to point b the beginning of the semester to the end of the semester and if he loses some crew members along the way so be it hilarious chill guy if you get to know him a little
2.5,W,true she does expect you to be a newswriter at the start of class she really teach you anything and then when you ask for help she tells you to look it up be prepared to write in your book and bring it everyday to class she is nice though
5.0,W,i really enjoyed this professor she was very open and honest in discussions i can tell she enjoys sharing her extensive knowledge if i had her class sooner i considering changing my major she grades fair and challenges students to do their best she really had a positive impact on my life by what i learned
4.5,W,she is really passionate about what she does she treats students like her peers and is really open about everything go to the lectures even though not mandatory if you go and pay attention the written exams will feel like a breeze she makes you read some stories but you also watch movies too
2.0,W,i took prof gilson because i read her rate my professor reviews and they seemed good i hard a very hard time in her class that i ended up dropping her class weeks into the semester i missed class and she would not give me any notes or tell me what we discussed she only grades based on exams and participation
5.0,W,been an incredible mentor for not only me but many others she keeps her students in mind and updates on possible internshipsjobeducational opportunities she has your back if you put the effort in--grades on development listen to her advice and always ask questions be afraid to speak up hands-down the best professor at ou
4.5,M,professor allard is tough but fair he is very clear and concise in his lecture presentation and will give you all the tools and support needed to succeed while promoting academic independence
4.0,M,honestly such a great professer his lectures were always funny and most of the time he would point out interesting ways to look at the novels or content we were reading always willing to help and always dropped hints for essays and exams for those who went to lecture easy exams if you went to class and listened
5.0,M,best professor he keeps you intrigued with his lectures as long as you go to the lectures and seminars and put in an effort this class will not be a problem to get a good mark his exams are no surprise because he is crystal clear with what he wants you to know
3.5,M,kind of a weird class i had him for psychology and the lectures were super long at first and not much for the test was covered in class but towards the end you realize you have to show up to class except on test days and his stories and life lessons are actually really good and funny a good guy easy a
5.0,M,great guy very interesting and his lectures will definitely make you reexamine everything you thought you already knew expects you to know your stuff and read the assigned chapters but he has great stories that go along with his lectures
4.5,M,took psychology of death and dying with him and while it seemed to be his specialty he teaches all psychology classes and based on my experience recommend him for any class very little homework very little reading but honestly learned more from him than all other ccc professors combined what a cool dude
5.0,M,he is the best professor i had so far his lectures are very interesting and just read the book and pass his class very funny guy and he is very passionate and knows his stuff
4.0,M,he goes off topic and gets into politics he is a very successful investor and a former special operations naval officer he is an expert on making money if you want to get technical on details then take other professors but if you want to talk business in general terms then this is the professor to take
2.5,W,there is no question she would not do anything to help her students but she does not know how to teach she spends most of the class going off on her soap box about stuff that has nothing to do with the course than she will not allow a break and makes you do all her test in the testing center on your time take her for chef
2.5,W,does not stick with in her own grading rubrics changes assignments at the last minute does not follow her own syllabus talks about herself a lot in class for papers grades on a five point scale a four will drop you to an eighty a three to a sixty extra credit is not helpful to your final grade
5.0,M,i took jim for multiple classes and in each of his classes learned a lot took him for life drawing twice intro to painting oil painting and drawing
4.5,M,he is a great teacher gives constructive criticism all the time he uses a lot of repetition which got pretty boring to me after half of the semester he grades you based on your final portfolio mostly and daily sketches we only used the book about two times he is strict and does not like ppl who are constantly late the nude models are cool
4.5,M,very likely the hardest working and most dedicated instructor that i have seen in a while will push students to do their very best and works hard to make sure students have a good learning environment be warned he is tough and will not take any bs come on time come prepared and work hard for your grade
5.0,M,if u hv passion and wanna learn a lot of drawing jim will help u a lot he is good at not only teaching art but also helpful for letting u know what is right thing to do in your life show him your effort and u will do great
5.0,M,enomoto is the nicest teacher of all time he is very chill and does not yell he also explains thing very well
5.0,M,work hard play hard he always says that veryful and making the class interesting
3.5,M,easy class he is a bit unclear with his instructions at times though he never answers on etudes i took it online and you have to come to campus for the exams final textbook with required homework assignments is very overpriced if you understand computer basics then this is an easy a class
4.5,M,velleman is an excellent teacher i actually enjoyed reading the textbook which he wrote due to its conversational style and interesting examples he posts all his lectures online so attendance is not mandatory if you choose not to go you should still watch the lecture videos they help with the homework
4.5,M,i loved this class velleman is excellent professor perhaps the best had so far at cornell i had no experience with statistics before his class but his lectures and textbook were so clear you can tell that he knows his concepts inside out and great at explaining them i strongly recommend him
4.5,M,great guy conveyed a lot of passion about the subject and gave a great intro to statistics he really understands what he is teaching and to whom and the class is well structured even though there was some confusion about the he was also very democratic as to grading exams removing confusing questions post-exam
4.5,M,i took this professor for both eng and and i enjoyed the class he made the early class interesting because most like myself were worked nights i believe he is a hard talent to follow in his field the professor is there to help you write scholarly papers job is not to hold your hand through the process
3.0,M,if you want an a take this class he is extremely knowledgeable in his field but not real computer saavy copy the questionsanswers to all powerpoints down as you will need those for the online tests for each chapter classmates are loud and rude to him and take advantage of his kind nature no final-just show up to get your final grade
3.5,M,he is really easy if u want to really understand and know things from his class i advice you to take another person he is an easy a all you have to do is come take attendance and leave if u he just makes you work on the test questions witch are on line if u need a humanities class take him he is easy
2.0,M,a good guy but has terrible teaching methods most of the learning is done through wikipedia and in class presentations done by the students the class had potential but his method of having students teach students is terrible lots of work for little reward
3.0,M,so he is the most confusing person ever heard speak however he can be so helpful if you just ask for help i really encourage going to office hours they help a lot and he really is a really great guy you have to learn when to stop paying attention when it stops making sense
2.5,M,if you have dr ream run for it a nice guy but a very confusing professor his lectures are random and scrambled he organized his tests are pretty hard vs the study guide he gives out and even get me started on the online homework completely awful i would not recommend
5.0,M,excellent teacher very patient allows corrections on most tests and assignments for credit he also allows a fair amount of notes to use during quizzes and tests if you go to class and write notes on everything he writes on the board you will succeed he is always willing to take time and help i got an a in his class
4.0,M,very patient and willing to help his students so much his quizzes and and tests are not too hard tests are based on the quizzes highly recommended
4.0,M,fred will explain and re-explain it he is patient and will help you outside of class great visual aids in the classroom
4.5,W,she explains every thing really well and is extremely sweet with her students makes sure they understand everything before moving on to another subject the class is interesting but she makes it even more fun that is if you like math she is truly an amazing teacher she made my first semester much easier
4.5,W,amazing teacher i loved her go to your classes spend some time reading over her past finals and an a guaranteed
4.5,W,best professor ever she is willing to help if you follow her instructions you can do great i love her
5.0,W,the best teacher ever her explanations are great and very clear she is very nice and knows that you need plenty of examples to understand the material all she does are examples in class which is the only way in my opinion that math should be taught go over her past practice exams very very similar
4.0,W,easy marker the beginning material is pretty simple so not much to discuss there she does a pretty good job when the topics get a bit more complex but since the course proof-based there is quite a bit of handwaving when it comes to theoretical rigour a necessary evil
5.0,W,class seems overwhelming but not only papers if you take it in her week summer class i got a b and did everything the night before she is super nice and sweet just me it look like you care and you will do amazing just but little effort in
5.0,W,please take her if you can she made writing so much fun she offered lots of helps on your wants everyone to succeed in her class she often go above and beyond for her students the best english teacher i had
5.0,W,great professor helps with everything take her great with feed back amazing all around
1.0,M,dont take this teacher if you have trouble with math i had to spend a lot of extra time in the math lab because his lessons were so unclear i ended up dropping the class and just taking an online course would not recommend this professor to anyone avoid if possible
3.5,M,he is such a sweet guy every second week there is a test but it is open notes
2.5,M,he knows the material but presents is in a dry manner the book is interesting but not necessary to get most readings are online attendance is taken and could help boost grade papers are worth small percentages tests worth more do the online practice tests read correct answers and do well ta is helpful
3.5,M,i find this class to be a breeze if you actually do the things he tells you to its an easy a or b the multiple choice questions are literally word for word from practice tests and his papers are very short and clear cut you follow the criteria and you get like i managed to do the lectures very interesting though
3.5,M,professor lectures can at times be dry due to his sometimes monotone voice but if you are interested in psychology there is no way to make this subject boring his exams are easy if you do the online quizzes which have all the answers in them most of the class got but that due to poor work ethic he provides the way to an a
1.0,M,this professor needs to retire now i took his psych class and it was horrible boring lectures confusing material and not helpful the tests are really hard he gives you the ahead of time but expects you to memorize multiple choice questions and only chooses of them for the actual test dont take
1.0,M,worst professor ever hes def on my worst professor list this guy has so checked out of teaching its not even funny hes close to retirement and it shows he didnt even correct our papers he had his grad student do it so in reality we werent even writing for him because the grad student wasnt even correcting by his guidelines so boring
5.0,M,dr a is an amazing director he will push you and others in the choir harder than any other director you will learn how to make near flawless music for the purpose of delivering beautiful texts and messages a once in a lifetime opportunity to work with a musician of his calibre
5.0,M,i loved him super fun and helpful take any class he teaches really fun to talk to too just an all around amazing professor my favorite one so far and on my third year of college
5.0,M,damen was by far my favorite professor this semester he is very enthusiastic about his subject matter and so funny he makes learning history very interesting he put grades on canvas but if you do all writing assignments and pass all tests have an a all test material is bold words on online textbook great teacher great class
5.0,M,very enthusiastic teacher he will tell you exactly what he will be covering in each class in the syllabus all test questions come straight from the online text book put bolds the important words you ever need to go to the lectures if you read the text book i never did but got an a the text book is also an audio book
1.0,W,lady is impossible lectures are all over the place she teach the material clearly at all in fact the online quizzes look foreign since you learn nothing in her class actually really annoying if you email her to asked for clarity be prepared for a word answer and no explanation you need to read the book to understand
4.0,W,okay she rushes through the material kinda quick good at science so i have a tough time but you definitely have to read the chapter in order to do well on the quizzes which are online so are the tests no projects attending class in mandatory you get points a pretty great person
5.0,M,highly recommended to anyone dr k is literally one of the coolest professors i have ever run into mainly because he is just a wonderful human being he is so intelligent and so compassionate and he understands the way that education should work i wish i could have him for more classes if you are a smart cookie you will take his class
5.0,M,great guy understands that college students and knows just a requirement for most of us i was born and raised a catholic and learned more about the religion than i have my whole life mind being in his class on a thursday night
4.5,M,dr class was awesome i learned a lot about catholicism he is a very down to earth guy that understands students he shares some very interesting stories and real world examples during class
5.0,M,dr k is undoubtedly one of the best prof at depaul his course was very exciting i learned a lot of things about the catholic religion he explained well his lecture and give us all the info that we need in is awesome not to mention he is a very attractive and good looking man one thing i regret was that i had him for only weeks
5.0,M,respectful towards students has plenty of patience and takes his time to answer any questions grades consistently and fairly and is overall very friendly person one of the best professors i have come across
5.0,M,a hard course but you need to be focused on whatever he give to get an a grade he is very helpful and will answer or clarify any question you may have i really enjoyed this class and learned a lot read read read your textbook to understand and if you you will regret that and everything will be very hard to understand
4.5,M,awesome teacher really easy going and really tries to help you understand the material i had him for acct and i am taking him again for
4.5,W,odette was very helpful i learned a lot about myself and my personal teaching styles her assignments are helpful for the future as a student who was not in her advisory she directed me towards better courses which i provided for my actual advisor odette you rock
3.5,W,chantal is very clear about exactly what she wants and is willing to answer any questions easy to get ahold of her and her ta her lectures are pretty much a summarysynthesis of the readings so easy to get away with not doing a deep reading ahead of time there is no textbook she makes the readings available for free
1.0,W,so disappointing i honestly feel like any of the girls in our class could do a better job of teaching this course than her regurgitates the readings during class without interpreting them or trying to engage the students in discussions when she does ask us questions she barely understands our responses most of the time avoid her
2.0,W,seems to have little respect for her students she does not seem to enjoy teaching at all avoid
5.0,W,not even sure if easy is the word for her class as long as you turn in every assignment and look at the during the online tests you are basically gaurenteed an a also make sure to attend as much as possible that is part of your participation grade i did everything the day it was due in her class so not joking
1.0,W,rude when asked questions in class she says look it up read your book when you ask about due dates in class she tells you look online bring your syllabus to class her lectures are crazy disorganized good luck taking notes tests are insanely hard taking notes and reading the book help papers are easy once i liked art
1.0,W,top worst teachers had at vol state she is rude and reads from power points every class all class accused me of plagerizing an opinionated paper like i was not capable of producing a material would not take awful teacher
2.0,W,this teacher will kill your gpa if you looking for an art class just because your major calls for one look further this is no ordinary art class as the criteria may state she sucks at everyway she teaches talks all class more like a history class i swear you could take the powerpoints from lecture and still fail her test
4.0,M,he is an excellent teacher for math majors i highly recommend taking a different teacher if you are not a math major he teaches fundamentals of math not formulas if you are not a math major pay attention and show up to study groups
5.0,W,mrs johnson is one of the most compassionate teachers i have ever had she takes the time to make sure that you understand the material and she is extremely understanding of the situation of her students ive never had a teacher take so much interest in my academic welfare when you need help she is always there i really lucked out
4.0,W,the class itself was hard at first then it got easier did not have a good experience with the teacher she was very rude and not encouraging either when time came for students to drop the class she said if anybody wants to drop let me know so i can get forms ready she should be encouraging us to continue and help not drop it
1.0,W,she is a nice enough individual but absolutely no help for the subject the only teaching that she does is hand out print outs of how to use stat crunch and most of the time what she gives you is unclear and the examples are not helpful at all i would only recommend taking this class if you want to teach yourself how to do statistics
3.0,M,he is a good teacher tests are extremely hard if you read the chapters thoroughly it will give you a lot better of an understanding there is not a lot of supplemental materials for what to study tests are over chapter and i find it difficult to know the most significant topics out of chapter stay involved in discussions
1.0,M,worst teacher i have ever had let me explain why he has one assignment where you have to answer essay questions so i answered them all with a pretty large paragraph each but i forgot to include what page numbers i found each answer from in the book so i got a grade so i could have just gave the page numbers and got a
5.0,W,i love dr coston she is great and very helpful it was a pleasure taking a class with her and look forward to take more classes she really care for students
2.0,W,i say whether prof mitchell knows her stuff or not she just posted the same cookie-cutter material used in every gen psych class but do not expect her to work with you in an emergency and do not expect any kind of feedback at all
1.5,W,be prepared to teach yourself if you take this class online instructor offers no help she very rarely checks or responds to emails i was excited at first to take this class and ended up very disappointed
5.0,W,ms mitchell is awesome she is so nice and willing to help if needed she makes her classes interesting and fun i have taken of her classes and i wish i could take more the only time i have ever looked forward to going to school is when i was in her class
4.0,W,a good teacher overall if you are not experienced programming i would recommend you take python before hand or some moocs otherwise it will be a little bit tough not because of her teaching style but more so the java language that other students find tough and this class will prepare you for c more so than python
3.0,M,expects you to have basic knowledge before class and have all chapters read doesnt waste any class time and uses all of his time proficiently he is quite experienced and a knowledgeable programmer although he is not good at teaching
1.5,W,most uninspiring person at ocad she may be well educated but this self dubbed dragon woman is the least empathetic person i have ever met grading did not correspond with ass guidelines tried to ask for feedback as to y i failed she yelled at me rather than providing constructive criticism dropped her class took it in the summer got an a
2.5,M,good professor lectures are interesting makes the class fun to attend likes giving pop-quizzes homework is easy points takes attendance harsh grader on exams be as precise and clear with answers as possible or he wont give credit
3.5,M,there is three exams all online and two one page single spaced papers i read the book once or any of the assigned readings and did just fine you do need to study for the exams but if you take notes you should be fine he can get sidetracked and sometimes the lectures that engaging
3.5,M,dr gongaware was a very good professor his tests are all online and only two one page papers lectures can get long and boring but some of the material is interesting just do the review guides and be fine

1.0,M,take someone else if possible hes confused ididnt gt him hard to understand
4.0,M,good professor knows what talking about make you think deeper into the subject if you actually come to class attendance was never mandatory he specifically says show up to class regularly so half the semester is enough come in sign in leave just do the papers make sure you answer all of the questions pass
2.0,M,first time with this professor and i thought he was easy technically you can miss class times for attendance participation much just a midterm and final watch a lot of movies in class complains about kean a lot easy a
5.0,M,an awesome teacher that really cares about you and your grade he is very clear with what is on the exam he even lets you drop an exam gives out fair amount of extra credit so getting a good grade in his class too difficult
5.0,W,amazing the way she teaches is like learning with you and make you feel more comfortable and confident in learning you feel really involved in her class because we had daily class discussions about real interesting topics be prepared to write short easy pieces everyday but everything about this class helps and enjoy it
5.0,W,mrs e is among the best teachers ever met english was for a long time my least favorite subject and prior to taking mrs e i was not looking forward to through another english however mrs class blew me away she covers some incredibly fascinating topics and she gives you free reign to explore them take her class
4.0,W,ms e was truly one of my favorite professors of all time she really was able to make me think out of the box and fill my brain with knowledge about things that are never really spoken about as long as you do all your writing assignments every night which will be assigned every single night you will pass the class without any problems
5.0,M,take this class as long as you take notes and study you will pass chris is great at explaining things there are lecture tests and lab tests and he puts lots of info on elearn to help you study
4.0,M,dr frank is a great professor his lectures tend to be on the boring side but he tries to make it entertaining by throwing in jokes tests are easy if you really study the study guides always willing to help and work around your schedule always writes nice comments and smiley faces on exams if you do well great
4.5,M,i really like professor mann he was extremely clear about what he wanted and though his test were difficult they were completely doable if you put a little time into studying i would definitely recommend taking him he is an excellent teacher i plan to take him next semester and wish that he taught lectures at the gallatin campus
5.0,M,dr mann rocks if you pay attention to his lectures in class and online he gives you everything you need to be successful he will explain anything to you but you have to ask this is not an easy class and you have to study the time you put in will directly show in your grade
5.0,M,the absolute best professor i have ever had he is very intelligent and willing to help if willing to help yourself i barely cracked open my book every thing comes from his power points i would recommend him to anyone i took the hybrid class and loved it well as much as you can love anatomy
5.0,M,the best professor i have had at emu he is so passionate and this class is so relevant to the education department he loves discussion and is completely interested in his students there is a ton of reading but he has perfected this course so that all readings are appropriate loved this professor
3.0,M,i really enjoyed this class his discussions were important and relevant to education today however there is usually a right opinion to have in his class know what it is papers are only and are ridiculously regimented there is a thesis template i felt like a was writing a meap essay again
4.0,W,this was a good class i am a veteran typist but really enjoyed the class and learned a lot i have arthritis but still did well in the class professor moore my actual instructor but she wrote the syllabus and information and was helpful when help was needed
1.5,W,assignments are heavy and instructions are walls of text exams online are difficult with fill in the blank answers that must be exact this is a good class if you want to be a secretary and redundant in word if you take another required class this class should focus on typing only she makes assumptions about disabilities arthritis
4.0,W,i had her this year for bus comm online very nice and helpful the assignments are easy and their are so so so many extra credit quizzes and they have unlimited amount of times you can summit would def take her if i could again
4.5,M,mr assante is very clear about what he expects in the speeches that you give over the semester hes a very good speaker and even gave us a great motivational speech at the beginning of class
4.0,M,mr assante gives very interesting lectures and explains topics well he has an easy-going personality and is willing to work with you in my public speaking class the three big things he expected of us when giving a speech is keep it simple clean and have your audience in mind
2.5,M,make sure you show up to class or you will fail he always clear on what looking for on tests so make sure you pay close attention and take notes the way he grades is very un-organized so ask him frequently or he tell you but maybe once or twice with the book you only need it for a list of definitions for one test only tests
1.5,M,his class made me angry he wandered off topic a lot you even have to show up to know what was going on he barely paid attention to the students he often asked our opinions just to interrupt us tell us we were wrong then move on to the next opinion he was rude and made me not want to go into mass communications
4.5,M,i loved professor osaitile he was very sweet and really cared about his students and explained things a lot if someone still understand this was by-far my favorite class he is such a sweetheart and love him he is really big on participation and gives out a ton of points at the end of the semester that really help your grade
5.0,M,personally this class was the easiest i tell you that he gives points out like skittles prior to this class i did hear that he was very hard he is not he is strict tho when it comes to directions but i passed with an a pretty funny and easy going guy he wants you to succeed it does get annoying whn he asks to read frm the book use a lot
4.5,M,professor osaitile is not easy but he is more than fair you have to follow all of his instructions the devil is in the details if you participate in class follow the instructions and show up for every class you will do well i learned a lot from his class and most of it was paying attention to what i have been asked to do
1.0,M,used to be my best subject but very professor he means well but honestly the language barrier was an issue and his grading was ridiculous he handed back a paper times to fix without past page so i never knew what to work on and got bad grade anyways talking to him was no help he acted like i was stupid
4.0,W,this was one of my toughest professors at volstate i had her for american literature so obviously i had to read before every class period i also had to write journal entries for each reading assignment do the journals last minute you will have to compile them into a folder to turn in you always have to participate in class
3.0,W,i loved mrs malden because of her sarcastic sense of humor but the class for me was pretty hard we had four papers going on at once and it very organized so i was left confused a lot she is very strict on her grading so take the time on your papers or you will end up failing if you miss more than classes your grade goes down a grade
1.0,W,this class is very easy a short essay every other week and a few in class group projects judy is always mins late to class and often cancels class she is unorganized and her on the board and in prompts is terrible but if she like your wording in your paper she will mark you an entire letter grade down
2.5,M,professor tsui was so convoluted in his explanations for problems it left me even more confused he goes above and beyond in his lectures so be prepared his exams are the hardest i have ever taken here even after taking orgo and biochemistry be prepared
2.0,W,horrible horrible professor she hardly every smiles and when she does very rare because of the time she is yelling at her students like children be prepared to feel like an idiot if you have the answer she is looking for she is by far the rudest lady on the planet i can honestly say i hate her
1.0,W,stay away from her she give us alot of homework i was spend the weekends doing the online homework it takes me more than hours so be careful
1.0,W,rude and treat the students like if they were in high school if you talk while talking she makes you stand up until done hate this teacher with passion she has a different personality every day take this teacher an old she care if trying everything needs to be perfect recommend her
3.5,W,tough class with a lot of material although much of it is dry you will learn a lot probably more than you should in a single week class tests are straightforward and follow the reading she is a ton
5.0,W,great teacher to take talks about the importance of effort and learning with passion love to take another class with her
4.5,W,she is amazing to listen to my favorite class ever very discussion based no tests three short papers possibly creative project substitute a group project and two short write ups of your choice do your best to read and talk with her if things come up she can be flexible with assignments not out to fail you but you have to try hard
4.0,W,if taken her before for a level class and are expecting her social theory class to be just as easy think again the tests are killer reading is not optional if you want to pass the tests are not multiple choice matching and short answer
4.0,W,taking her for minority groups if you read over the material at least some before the test make an a or b discussion boards are basically completion grades be prepared to stay the full class time--she has a lot to say
5.0,M,i say enough about dr mulrooney i was doing poorly in his class due to some personal issues that kept me out of class i sat down with him in his office after class to talk about it and see what i could do and i have to say that hands down the most understanding professor had he let me retake the exam i missed incredible man
4.0,W,overall she is a good teacher who covers everything that are on the final exams a lot of the need to go to class is covered by the wileyplus test and practice although as always it is advised that you do go as she will lecture using good examples and explanations
4.0,W,she is a nice professor she tries to explain everything for us even though its just same questions
4.5,W,easiest college class ive ever taken she gives a lot of small easy assignments a lot of points in this class which helps if you decide to not do one or two easy class and her being very attractive makes it easy pay attention
4.5,M,i had dr fonseca for an honors seminar but he was very helpful and available to the students he is very quick to email back and was very generous when grading our powerpoint presentations he may be different as a regular professor but i was very satisfied with him as an honors seminar instructor
5.0,M,dr curra really cares for his students he is very helpful and will do whatever it takes to help and encourage his students to succeed yes the tests can be hard just read the material and pay attention to his lectures and do fine he knows what talking about and a very intelligent individual communicate with do great
4.0,M,professor is awesome such a kind and calm guy take a class again with him in a heartbeat and yes he talks quietly listen well worth it
1.0,W,she marks too hard for the quality of her classes and her overall knowledge as an esl instructor is poor her explanations are vague her spelling terrible and she deducts marks for corrections that people at the writing centre make on your essays her comments will not help you at all she gives you whatever grade she wants to horrible
1.0,M,he is the reason i changed schools this is the poorest computer science experience had i suggest that other students complain to higher-ups about him change majors or go elsewhere for cs i wonder why this department is doing so poorly when this area should be booming
1.0,M,the worst professor so far at cs department he cannot tell you why he draws little figures on the board while mumbling something and expects to see notes he picks on random students sometimes one student a lot and asks a question to put you on the spot if you answer correctly assume your grade from that
5.0,M,purely the only professor in njcu who knows his computer science i am not joking he is the best thing in that department three tests which includes midterm and finals in the three tests projects are really simple wants work but because of him i got a job as a software engineer i cant thank him enough for all his help to me never stop teaching
2.5,W,she is super easy and hilarious the only negative thing was that her grading on the essays was very inconsistent i would take her again though because you really have to focus in there outside of class lol
5.0,W,dr zeigler obviously loves teaching and talking about science and she does so very well she engages students in the lectures but still stays on topic best science teacher ever had
4.5,W,z is a great teacher knowledgeable passionate for her subject her lectures are clear to the point and often hilarious surprised by how much i learned bec the class seems so casual but i found myself retaining most of the material its been almost a year since i took her class and i can still identify rocks and minerals on the fly
4.0,W,professor is both knowledgeable and caring she wants her students to succeed and is willing to work with you the book need it for the test and quizzes also if you can take her for both lecture and lab hurry her classes fill up fast
5.0,W,from day mrs z told us to see her for tutoring from day i did with a group of my peers and it helps immensely i am passing her class with a mind you i been in school in a decade she has helped everything make sense again she rocks
5.0,W,i loved that woman so much that i even put it into words hands down one of the best instructors i have ever had in my life she is not unreasonable in any way she gives you clear instructions and pushes you to not be a procrastinator she is incredibly lively and hilarious and her lectures are rarely boring take her course it
3.0,W,a nice sweet teacher even though her lectures can be a tad boring funny and tries to lighten up the class if none of the students participates her tests really match of what she lectures you just have to read the whole chapter to get the answers
1.0,W,she speaks softly and does not teach what is on her tests one time we spent days on one chapter and there was one question on the test about it she picks favorites with students and does not do well with questions if you ask her a question it turns into a argument
4.5,W,good teacher grades fairly and gives many opportunities to students to do well a little quirky but overall a good instructor she likes lots of oral discussion and writing show up participate in class and complete assignments they will help on exams
5.0,W,super helpful i have never worked on a lawnmower before but she was very understanding in the lawnmower lab and was quick to answer any questions we had go to class not hard and an easy a if you just show up lectures were usually really short
2.5,W,there is a huge group paper and lots of long lectures there were plenty of class related movie days the real problem i had with the class was the actual grading it seem standard at all more like it depended on what mood she was in this is kind of teacher to not round up your grade been warned
3.5,W,she is very passionate about what she teaches which is admirable rarely gets through the entire lectures but is nice enough to post all of them online the papers and tests are really hard but she grades the papers easily the class is definitely not a blow off but it is not impossible to get an a you also watch a ton of movies
5.0,W,just be sure to pay attention and actually study for the tests the class will be pretty easy fret over the page essays because get a good grade as long as you include all that she asks for in the rubric nothing too difficult a great professor knowledgeable very nice pretty funny
4.0,W,she is a really nice professor and most lectures are pretty intersting i took female biology and bones bodies and disease for bbd she tells you to read an emily craig book but its awaste of time there is only one question in the test about it and i got it wrong any ways you have to write ten page papers
5.0,M,dr baker is by far the best instructor that i have ever had he is very friendly and he legitimately cares for his students he helped us with the transition into the aem program and he is absolutely amazing the midterm and final are both multiple choice which take minutes each attendance is of your grade so show up for class
5.0,M,dr baker is there to inspire you he teaches you about introductory aerospace engineering but what he really wants to do is to inspire you to succeed in life he really does this well and he enjoys what he does always willing to help even with his busy schedule as department head attendance is of the class so if you show up you pass
5.0,M,midkiff is awesome he is very easy to understand and he puts all his notes online he is also easy to talk to and very understanding if you need help
5.0,M,dr midkiff is the man all notes are posted online he is very helpful and his exams are more than fair a lot of homework though
5.0,M,i took prof hu summer he is a great teacher very willing to help gives tons of examples during the lecture he does have an accent but you get used to it very kind and nice teacher he gives tons of hw but how you learn math anyway quizes everyday were group were individual on test you can bring small note
5.0,M,i took prof hu summer he is a great teacher very willing to help gives tons of examples during the lecture he does have an accent but you get used to it very kind and nice teacher he gives tons of hw but how you learn math anyway quizes everyday were group were individual on test you can bring cheat sheet
5.0,M,fall night speak cantonese mandarin english and post solutions notes are check homework but give you value final grade from homework problems you could use a formula paper in exam is open book notes so print all solutions from his final review and at least read them once
3.0,M,nice guy but a tough teacher all classes are straight lecture so be ready to take notes for tests he gives you terms and essays he picks a portion of them on test day i had to work hard for a and i have a solid background in apush take it only if very serious even then take with caution
4.5,M,very good teacher highly recommend him as a teacher if you have to take geo he makes the work easy to understand and worth learning
5.0,M,heywood is an absurdly easy prof his attitude is your grade is what matters not how you get it so all the tests are online you can do them in groups the quizzes have exact questions a few days ahead of time online etc that said funny smart and not hard to listen to in lecture and got an epic beard total badass
5.0,M,rick is the only professor ever had that describe as badass done some acting in the past and it shows his lectures are engaging funny and thorough enough to be thought-provoking seriously each one of his lectures sounds like own ted talk by the end he is also very open to student input and answers questions on the fly
3.5,W,i think one of the pitfalls reviewers of lair fell into was not going to see her or staying a few minutes after class to ask questions she looked scary set tough rules but when talked to she relaxed many of the rules was very helpful her class is par for the course its math requires work out side of class to pass o look for it
2.0,W,vickie lair is the worst teacher i have ever had i would not be in her class if it the only opening left wonder why confusing forgetful and very unreasonable when it comes to class she post grades ever your responsibility her reviews for tests are barely that and she crams everything together take her
1.5,W,horrible she was no help and gets confused as she writes on the board
1.0,W,she has to be the worst teacher i have ever had i got a problem wrong on my hw simply because i didnt put a dash in my z so she argued that it was a i would have problems correct but still have no points for the problems because of fact she requires you document every single step even the minor ones dont take her class
1.5,W,she grades way to hard taking points off for a misplaced negative sign even if the answer is right i asked her for help pulling my grade up and she said smart figure it out she gets confused and when asked a question just repeats how she explained it before until they give up and say they get it do not take her
4.5,W,mrs lair turned out to be a great teacher she seems scary but do not be afraid to ask her questions her homework is tough but will help you in the long run if you plan on going any further with math she was more than willing to meet with me outside of class
1.0,W,worst class the lecture is word for word from the book with unclear explanations and no way to answer questions this class was not supposed to be hard but it was and more difficult with this instructor she spent more time talking about investing in stocks and how she started a business when she was years old than she did teaching
1.0,W,run away even though i was warned about her horrid teaching skills i still took the class thinking i could pass by learning independently or with a tutor i was sooo wrong take stats with judy her philosophy on teaching is students read the text book three times and ask questions worst teacher i have ever had ever
3.5,M,professor rose is accomplished in the industry a tough grader and he really cares about interest sit in the front answer questions come to class you need to pay attention in the lectures take good notes and read the current events articles tested on them weekly quizzes usually based on the book so yeah you need it
4.0,M,by far the best professor i have ever had at fordham this review mirrors the others but i will reiterate the workload is intense so be prepared for multiple assignments due within days of each other midterm and final are extremely difficult however he is a phenomenal professor and i learned so much from him he knows his stuff take him
5.0,W,simple class very interesting material in my opinion stuff i never knew before but could help me later in life good to get a science credit has reviews outside of class before the tests go also read the textbook chapters i averaged a b on all the tests but with the lab grade and all the help she gives you i made an easy a
1.5,M,there is no feedback from him ever i still received any scores am unsure about my grade and there is only one class left he is not clear on his expectations and give much direction
5.0,M,he is the best professor i have ever had he has so much energy so it matter if you take him in the morning or at night he will keep you awake take notes in class participate and attend class you should be fine
5.0,M,love love love best prof at middlesex county college hated history before i took him attend class and participate and you will get an a
4.5,W,loved her she was my favorite professor ever
3.5,W,i like her as a teacher her lectures were horrible and you could tell she had no interest in teaching anatomy as a person though hysterical i loved her dry sense of humor
4.0,M,amazing prof cares about the students and really wants you to do well his lecture notes are really confusing but i think he is hoping people will make use of your textbook he really knows what he is talking about he is a very smart man i relied on my textbook a lot to the extent that going to class probably necessary
3.0,M,he is a nice man but his lectures are long and confusing you have to read the textbook otherwise you really know what is happening make sure to study really hard he really like for you to ask questions but as long as you study and try to pay attention you should be fine
3.5,M,expects so much for an online credit course the articles were hard studies to read and write reviews on his feedback was a little harsh
4.5,M,i really enjoyed dr class the choice he gives for exams is fair with different students teaching styles a very friendly guy when visiting in the field and very approachable after class or during office hours sometimes it was hard to hear him during class but he was willing to repeat any missed directions and speak up if asked to
1.5,M,this professor is very unprofessional he responds to every question as if the student is questioning his intelligence enjoys talking down to students uses the term creativity as a grading parameter to take points away for no apparent reason he also likes to use double negative statements on exams to purposefully confuse students
1.0,M,textbook narcissist that simply should not be a teacher hot-tempered drops f-bombs and attacks and belittles students who ask questions you will have to find a way to let his racial comments cursing and talking to people like mentally handicapped not bother you just so you can pay attention in lecture very childish really
1.0,M,subjective and opinionated not a good teacher if every student in the whole program gets a terrible score on a lab assignment do you think it may have something to do with the clarity of the instructions never admits when he is wrong and he enjoys messing with your future by lowering your gpa hopefully you have a different teacher for
4.5,W,my favorite class with my favorite professor i like her teaching style she tells lots of funny stories that relate to the class and she really cares about her students
5.0,M,dr wolf is the best teacher i have had this semester at psc his lectures are always so interesting he encourages you to be bold say what you feel and have an opinion he is so and awesome i will take him whenever i can in my other classes buy a book the class is mostly just class discussions enjoy
3.5,M,i took contemporary literature with him and say it was very thought-provoking honestly never knew what topics we were going to cover in class but the debates and subjects we went over were entertaining keep an open mind in his be too sensitive to some of the things he brings up overall very interesting class
5.0,M,dr fields does lecture a lot but he tells stories to go along with it to keep your interest there are almost no assignments in this class but the tests are pretty tough even though there are only tests including the final they are pretty much your entire grade the textbook mandatory but it will help
2.0,M,do not take his drugs society class idk if the other reviewers were high when they wrote their review but he is a very difficult professor his final and midterm were outrageously hard if you miss more than time he was start taking off letter grades he also tells stories the entire class and very hard to stay awake
5.0,W,i took this class during the summer and it was a breeze there are three tests and a cumulative final dr williams is funny enthusiastic and always has a smile on her face she gave us fifteen minute breaks between lecture and film presentations and allowed us to eat during the films if looking to knock out a fine arts credit take her
2.0,M,intelligent but bad at explaining material expect to teach yourself office hours always packed he accuses you of skipping class and looks at you like your an idiot when you ask questions to clarify his confusing lectures only professor seen yell at a student or call them a liar a is possible b is likely c is common drop rate is high
4.5,M,cuevas was awesome he really helped expand my writing and improved critical reading and writing he will answer any and all questions you have and even encourages you to email whenever you have a question outside of class pretty funny and nerdy too and the essay topics are actually fun overall a cool class
1.5,M,just unless one of his favorites like you think you understand the assignment you could even meet with him about your ideas and be supportive and then you make a low grade because you apparently give him what he wanted
5.0,M,he was extremely clear during lectures and made sure that we understood the material before moving on he seemed to genuinely care about his success there was also a built in curve with the tests
4.0,M,he was pretty clear to understand and wanted everyone to succeed he posted last years tests and answers in order to help us review even though he gave some of the hardest webassign homework the tests were cake walks not even kidding he built points into each test and was huge on partial credit made calc a breeze
4.5,M,vo is a really nice guy and you can tell he definitely cares about his students and how well he teaches he changed his teaching style halfway through the year to make his lectures better tests are similar to the review that he hands out but can be long
4.5,M,really nice try to get use to his accent and you will see that he just asks you to be hardworking
3.0,M,biostats is hard with his lecture book and sample tests you will do fine be aware he is deaf in one ear so if you sit on that side of him in class your questions or attempts to get his attention will go un-responded to he is very shy but very kind if you meet him in office hours
4.5,M,a very nice professor exams one being the final and research papers quizzes are online but it helps to attend class if you want to understand the lectures better then reading the books help a lot i came by his office hours and he helped answer my questions
3.5,M,i took scripps for comp sci he certainly knew what he was doing when it came to programming and he usually was able to get the information across no real tests during the class other than midterm and final he uses a flipped classroom so be sure to watch the videos before class good not great teacher would take him again though
3.5,M,scripps has a very unique style of teaching you watch all of the lectures on youtube before class as homework and then go over the topics in class this method helps a lot because you can code right along with him and can pause and rewind any questions can be addressed the next day in class as you go over examples very good professor
4.0,M,not really sure why he has a chili pepper because he is old but nevertheless an awesome really hard but it was worth it he tells it how it is and give you all the politically correct bs a very cut and dry person really enjoyed his class
5.0,M,i took two of mr classes but i had withdraw during the second class now he is no longer teaching at tcc he is an excellent teacher and a very nice person thank you mr smith
4.5,W,i see why there is so much negativity her class is bearable and so long as you turn in your work and participate your bound to get a good grade she is reasonable and offers great info prior to your essays i would personally recommend the online class i got an a in the class and did little more than expected of a student
4.0,M,i took as an online class with rorke he definitely knows his stuff i would say he is not the most approachable or understanding professor his class is very interesting though all online exams are only open for a short window of time be prepared not an easy a study for exams even though they are open notes
4.5,M,his class was really fun he was very entertaining and kept the class interested he is very passionate for what he does and loves to interact with his students there are only three tests and are very easy if you read dont buy the humanities textbook posted online he has his own textbook that he requires you to buy tell you what to get
1.0,M,absolutely no structure to the class making it extremely difficult to know when or what to study must buy text book written by him and filled with spelling errors excessive rambling and organized poorly do not recommend
2.0,M,the tests are incredibly hard i saw that pretty much everyone in my class was getting the text book is a book that he wrote and full of typeos the lectures were extremely boring he does not have power points or notes so if you are a visual many people interested in this class may bother nice guy though
4.0,M,papers quizes harsh paper grader never felt like they were that bad go to office hours and let him read them before turning in quizes are all on reading but he gives you a heads up beforehand class was kinda boring unless he got off topic loved his accent though would recommend but he is hard on papers
4.5,M,his lectures are pretty straight forward and easy to follow he likes to give out exam related problems during the lecture so best to show up he grades a bit harder than most but you will do fine if you do the recommended problems and show up to class
3.5,M,he basically gives the type of questions that are asked on the exams and final he mainly just takes questions from hw and lecture notes and just changes them a bit so if you understand the concept your fine it is important that you come to his classes on time
2.0,M,he is not very clear when giving assignments and he have good people skills at all seems very nervous when teaching and treats students like little kids not good with controlling the classroom do not take course
3.5,M,makes the subject matter more interesting than many other professors can down to earth and understanding professor loves to play advocate during open discussions so take his comments personally much better class than expected
2.0,M,he is very boring soft spoken and likes to ramble he talks so slowly yet quickly that hard to decipher the gibberish that he speaks his slides are not great either keep your studies to the textbook
5.0,M,dr ferguson is also my advisor he is one of the best if not the best teachers ever had in my life not because of the content he taught me but because of the life lessons he cares about his students more than we care about ourselves sometimes if you love pe sure you will after just a few conversations with him love him
4.5,M,i really enjoyed taking this class you have to do the readings but he is very clear with what will be in the exams regarding lecture and what covered in class interesting approach to adult development he has or random days in which he will take attendance i recommend going to all lectures regardless they are very interesting
4.5,M,lectures are interesting his tests are very straightforward and the homework is minimal great professor and if you show up to class pay attention and read the textbook his class should be a breeze no surprises with him
2.0,M,mr meany is mean he is opinionated and quiet sarcastic however he knows his stuff he can be a great teacher if you and him share the same ideas but if you then going to be a nightmare
2.5,M,his course is pretty difficult probably not the greatest teacher ever had he can go off on a tangent that can definitely come off as self-indulgent but if a college student going to get professors like that and probably a good start in preparing for those sorts also pretty funny
4.5,M,i would be lying if i said he was easy but his personality is the besy he hates kids which will become apparent through his sarcasm and comments he is a genius and i personally think he is very attractive as for papers be prepared to cry and know your topic pass him off before you pick it but if you get on his good side he will help
1.0,M,do not have class with this professor he will tell you to follow the writing guide and mark you off for doing it if you have your own opinion on a reading and it is not like his you will be wrong he insults students in front of the other students and acts like he is better than everyone else first words out of his mouth is no one makes an a
5.0,M,everything is on webassign homeworkquizzes except for the midtermfinal so make sure to get it the ebook comes with webassign so you really need the actual book i fell a little behind in his class but caught up and passed with an a good luck really laid back and a great teacher you regret taking him d

1.0,M,hes not that great of a teacher he talks about a lot of irrelevant things you learn more about him than you do about the actual subject he does curve but you learn which sucks hes nice but his class and ethic are annoying he teach well his test and lecture correlate just study and stick thru the class
2.5,M,i took his mathematics for liberal arts class and it was ridiculously easy attendance mandatory there are open book exams he gives a review sheet before each exam that is basically the actual exam with the numbers changed he can be pretty unclear at times but if you ask him to explain himself he will
5.0,M,he straight gives you the answers to the test so if you listen get a you have easy papers every week easy a and he does not have class on fridays even though it is mwf
3.5,M,this class was by the far the easiest class i have ever taken at eku dr holcomb is very nice a little weird but you will learn to love him and make sure you go to every class no class on fridays and do your web assignments and complete your wellness project and theres no way you can get anything less than a b
4.0,M,his class was cake we were scheduled to meet mwf but we only ever met on mw his class is easy and you really have to do anything to do well other than your wellness project which still that hard
5.0,M,a really great teacher that really cares about the subject matter and his students
4.5,M,geib is a great guy and is very knowledgeable when it comes to management the class is focused on two case study projects and two exams so there is not a whole lot of extra work other than these his lecture and discussion sessions sometimes get a little boring but overall it was a good class
3.5,M,he will work with you but be ready to work
1.0,M,i have never known an educator more self-absorbed than griffin his classes when not completely empty of substance involve lectures pertaining to topics that only he would find relevant no clarity in assignments or grading criteria a discouraging presence in the classroom
3.5,M,i had dr bodek for my fyse-war trauma and culture and he was an awesome teacher he is really enthusiastic about the subject and has a lot of knowledge about it he is a very easy grader as long as you follow the simple criteria a lot of reading was necessary but no tests or finals great teacher easy class would definitely recommend
1.0,W,she gives a lot of work she know how to explain things and when you ask her questions she seems like she be bothered
4.0,W,an awesome teacher who depends on her students too much if the students feel like talking the class will drag on very sweet and easy to get along with but the class will drag if you do not participate lots of readings but papers are clear and not too hard
3.5,M,he is a great teacher and you can tell he is very passionate about what he does however for the career profile and seminar he is super super nit picky about what he wants other than that assignment in his class are just busy work
3.0,W,upon meeting dr iten she can seem rather intimidating but you need to go introduce yourself i struggled at the beginning but then realized that if i just start preparing at least a week in advance it is so possible to do well dr iten and the lab manual both put on a scary front but she makes a way bigger deal of it than it really is
1.0,W,professor iten wrote the lab manual for her class hence why the labs are extremely confusing the book is full of typos and wrong calculations unfortunately this class is required for biology majors so no way around it
5.0,M,great instructor can be intimidating at first but he just gets really excited about programming really helpful for new programmer at explaining concepts in plain english
2.5,W,not very clear always had something bad to say about accountants and lawyers never had an assignment graded by her as she leftwas removed halfway through the semester

5.0,M,mr rooney is a excellent professor his lectures are long but crystal clear with the use of humor and enthusiasm which makes the class interesting his class is composed of written work only and he is a tough grader you really need to take notes study the book and avoid skipping class in order to pass the class
4.0,M,i am taking the final for this class tomorrow but overall a good class the lectures are long but it really clarifies the concepts at first he was very repetitive but with more material it was very helpful his examples are funny and if you think funny at all then you probably have boring classmates you have to work but worth it
4.5,M,he is one of the best teachers i had in this community college although he is hard he is the fairest grader i have ever met if you want to learn how to think critically you should take this class he is very serious and afraid to tackle very critical logical misconceptions but if you want an easy a this the class for you
4.5,M,he comes across pretty strong at first scary even i thought that he would eat me alive if i ever asked a question not true he is incredibly helpful and respects you for trying and actually asking for help great guy great teacher he is too funny
2.5,W,tough class she expects endless amounts of detail in your short answer questions on tests the are tough too nice lady though who is very knowledgeable in psychology reading the textbook helped me a lot in the class she has in-class assignments worth marks so make sure to attend all classes to get some easy marks

3.5,M,he grades fairly easy the hardest part of his class is understanding his accent once you get past that class will be a pretty typical math-lecture class
4.5,M,very concerned with your understanding easy to understand once you get used to his accent quizzes are once a week and exams are based on incorporated on quiz makes math easy to understand

3.5,M,i took this class twice because i never understood npv fv and fell behind early in the class took this over the summer one midterm and a final homework is easy i got an a and ill tell you how you can succeed i read every chapter after lecture and before discussion take notes during class of his ppt and attend class
4.0,M,make sure to learn npv pv and fv early on in class understand these three key concepts and how they work if you do then be less hard to understand the course later on be careful if taking this class with or any jasso class if you do work hard i like chung he knows his stuff which is why not easy
2.5,M,class is tough he is not very helpful and is very snarky towards students practice midterms really help because the problems are completely different on the test only good thing about the class was the huge curve because the class average on midterms was

2.5,W,dr gfellner in her prime was apparently an amazing professor i think gotten burnt out over the years and her class content reflects it i passed because i bought the textbook and just took notes from it i blocked her out during class and just did my own thing from the textbook her wardrobe is super jazzy though interesting to look at
1.5,W,memorization regurgitation seem to be paramount no powerpoints made available unrealistic in her expectations confusing lecturer

1.0,W,dr perdue has her good moments but i would avoid her if you have the chance she is super opinionated and shoots down others opinions before they even try to share very intimidating does not like to answer many questions and rarely answers emails she does allow for make up exams the study guides she gives help much read the book
1.0,W,this professor is not clear about her expectations at all all of her exams are take home and you will not learn anything about the material in class use the book to find the answers she clearly hates men and fights stereotypes about women using stereotypes about men avoid this professor at all costs she is petty and spiteful in her grading
2.5,W,she is the least conventional professor i have ever had she is fearless in sharing her opinions and experiences an incredible person to learn from if a young woman looking to be inspired to stick it to the man take this class not a hard class if you can articulate your opinions and are a good reader
5.0,W,very easy class attendance is not mandatory but if you sit in the front row and are absent she will remember your face and wonder where you are very accommodating to those with disabilities gives a make up exam session at the end if you miss the one in class get ready to hear about her own sex life
2.0,W,if you have a choice do not take her people say she is honest but more like disrespectful its her opinion or nothing her tests easy and i end up teaching myself because she talks in class instead of teaching she does have makeups if you miss the test though attendance is not mandatory i never look forward to this class
4.5,M,frank is a good man i highly recommend him to you
5.0,M,mr sorem is by far my favorite instructor at pierce he is very helpful and clear as to what his expectations are you do have to work for your grade but he gives you all the tools needed to be successful in his class i would recommend his class to anyone who is a serious student and ready for a great educational experience
4.5,M,i thoroughly enjoyed my econ class with sorem very knowledgeable about his subject and goes into great detail about what he wants you to learn and take out of his lectures emphasize what he wants you to get out of his learning and the parts you need to focus on
3.5,M,had sorem for micro macro and have to say that macro with him was much easier than micro he goes through the process of graphs with supply demand rather quickly so you need to be paying attention or fall behind macro was much easier and a lot of fun with him he definitely knows his stuff and keeps the class fun and interesting
3.0,W,this teacher is very friendly but the tests are extremely hard and she gives quizzes every single day in the last minutes of class which i found very frustrating especially at the end of the day after a hour lecture
1.0,W,she will make you wait outside the classroom if you are late for even a minute if the assignment is pages she wants full more and no less this is a vigorous course cuz you hav to work in groups its already tough for people like me who prefer solo but its whatevs getting an a dont think so gettin that a is impossible

4.0,W,thee most toughest course you will ever take this is coming from someone who is an ed major this is a course where you actually learn and not be lazy this professor is obsessed with the friendships the critical issue for this course is that there is a lack of time hours per class would be love this class why must she retire
3.5,W,she is a great prof im a transfer i have to say my other school edu wise was much better until i took dean willis class theres a lot of group work but thats preparation for us as future teachers we are going to make a community with others so we need to start now i hope she doesnt leave shes the most helpful person in school of edu undergrad
5.0,W,the fact that dean willis can put up with me proves she is a worthy professor saying that helpful is an understatement yes all the work is done independently but we need the class time for stuff to prepare us future educators i dont see her class as a form of advertising but more of an informative ty for this experience
5.0,W,dean willis wants people to get to know each other because it is important to know your students whomever wrote the comment before should not be a teacher at all take advantage of what you learn and teach it and look to hurt someone who truly cares about her students she is an amazing person and i am so sad she is leaving sju

4.0,M,very hard but a good teacher accent but not too bad says right too much sometimes absent during his office hours but otherwise these were useful
2.5,W,at times difficult to understand with her accent but after a while you get used to it and her not too big of a problem all she does is read the book word for word she rushes through the problems as if we should understand them already she does help with homework once a week which is helpful
1.0,W,i did not like this class way too hard for a basic math class lectures were so boring and confusing she just did problems the whole time which help me definitely the worst class and probably worst professor had at uw so far seems like a nice lady but tests were so hard and were nothing like her practice tests

4.5,M,i learned a lot in this class honestly if a pre-med you need this class he teaches on the med school level he is hard but if you put in work you will make an a he had sunday sessions and after class coffee sessions no professor puts in this much effort to help his students go to everything make you get to know him and live
2.5,M,this was one of the most confusing classes his handwriting is impossible to read and his lectures were all over the place basically memorize all the amino acid structures and know all of the pathways and cycles backward and forward
3.5,M,this class was easy there really is no interaction with the professor so all up to you online resources are helpful if you need to take this class because a requirement take it because easy but if you want to learn and use it later take another teacher he is not the most friendly so expect much
1.0,W,do not take her
5.0,W,professor borgwardt is one of those professors that gives hope to the world of academia by ensuring future academics are mentored well her lectures and discussions are fascinating and she is attentive to students and their interests outside of class her office hours are frequent her insight is incredibly valuable and she is genuinely kind
2.0,W,clarity is not one of her attributes could be that english is not her first tongue
3.0,W,honestly one of my favorite professors i am through with my undergrad but her lectures are the ones i remember with great fondness
2.5,W,ewa is tough you will learn more than you ever thought you would three exams and two papers due she assigns a ton of reading i am taking five classes and half of my study time is just for her class alone make you work for the grade as all good professors should really interesting stuff just make sure you have the time
1.0,W,this professor is confusing to say the least essays questions are very unclear and she will not budge a millimeter when grading if you want to get an a you need to write a turn paper for every assignment i took this class to fill upper level class requirements and it turned into a nightmare i am a very good student but she is so condescending
1.0,W,tact test questions are ambiguous as are paper critiques she attacks students privately submitted work through discussion posts if you paraphrase and reword research and give credit to your sight source she will still give you an e for plagiarism cr hr class w an easy hr pr week work load
1.0,W,while the content she lectures on is very interesting and done well you will struggle to meet seemingly arbitrary expectations on the essay tests then as a added bonus your class will receive a lecture in broken english on how bad your english skills are the novelty of these occurrences fades quickly i would not recommend this course
3.0,W,karen douglas was a good lecturer but we have weekly chapters to read and weekly sometimes twice a week quizzes the quiz questions came from a question bank and she check the questions over before putting them on the quiz a lot of times the questions make sense but the one group presentation was easy if you got a good team
1.0,W,do not is unhelpful and super rude if you ask her a simple question she gives you a condescending answer and makes you feel stupid she make things clear and there are way too many quizzes the last few weeks you will have two a day i really feel like she sets people up for failure
1.0,W,terrible she is not helpful when a student understand she is very harsh and makes them feel very stupid maybe she is better online but i had her for in person but in my opinion she was not a very good teacher i can say i do not feel like i had a chance to connect with the material because it was not taught very well
4.0,W,took dr douglas developmental psychology during the summer and it was super easy only negative i can say is she grade the one and only writing assignment in a timely manner but still recommend her class
4.5,W,great instructor crystal clear about her expectations i had her for gen psych and lifespan would take her again in a heartbeat entirely up to you if you want an a
2.0,W,professor douglas grade assignments in a timely fashion so you were always left wondering and she give comments as to why she give you the full amount of points you have to read and memorize the chapters if you want to pass the quizzes and these are page chapters all in all i would not recommend taking her class
2.0,M,he was a terrible teacher he could not answer questions his quiz and test questions were unclear and there is never a word bank he counts answers wrong for spelling he took too long in the beginning of the semester and rushed through the end we even make it to the last chapters do not take him class started with and ended with
1.0,W,most unhelpful college instructor ever her exams are very confusing and reflect her lectures you can be a great note taker and do your best and read the text boooks but for the exams and papers unless you write specifically what her opnions are on the subject she will fail you many of her questions on the exam are subjective unclear
2.5,W,avoid her if you want to pass or get a good grade her tests are extremely hard and you have enough time to deal with out there to trick you everytime on the exams and her project is impossible
4.5,M,he is very kind--one of the best professors i have had so far at tech
4.5,M,take this class you will have a better understanding of humanity amrine is incredibly intelligent and really helpful his lectures are full of interesting notes on history science music art religion etc lots of reading but manageable and worth it
4.5,M,great professor very good to talk to during office hours he speaks with a passion that is hard to find in a lot of professors lectures often relate to the books but still are very interesting to those concerned with german culture if you have the chance take a class with this professor it will be a good experience
3.0,M,looking back at it i loved this class but he does get off topic and is a little confusing and eccentric all his tests are take home and you can always go to the tutoring center for them but he has links online that will help you pass easily he is an easy grader and really loves his students if you get on his good side then you will love it
5.0,M,wilson is such an amazing teacher definitely take him horrible at math and got an a in his class easy a
2.5,W,very nice lady but not a good instructor she has big assignments due very close together and thinks this is the only class we are taking there is so much work to do that difficult to turn things in on time her tests are ridiculously hard but she puts the hardest questions in the back so i start with the last question and work backwards
4.5,M,everyone has that one college professor dr ruckh is that professor he makes you think critically and while you will be over your head at times learn how to swim and it will be so rewarding you can take an easy a honors class but if you want a challenge are truly an academic deserving to be in the honors program take ruckh
1.0,M,this class is so much reading and ruckh is not very clear about what he expects from you the vagueness makes it impossible to get an a--unless he favors you of course
4.0,M,this class can be challenging and the lectures can be kind of hard to sit through but if you do not understand something dr ruchk and his are always willing to answer questions after class and in their office hours dr ruchk wants to make you think and he teaches in a very different way with that you have to go to class to keep up
3.0,M,ruckh is not easy but if you persevere and show interest and participate he will grow on you i ended up ending the class with an a a surprising a most interesting class i have ever took
5.0,M,i love hupp as a professor this is my second time taking him and i have zero complaints the field study was super easy only easy test and paper that is really your reference letter for him to write take him for any class he offers great professor
4.5,M,dr hupp is amazing he cracks jokes in every lecture that are actually funny his grading criteria for the paper is literally step-by-step and i actually learned a lot in his class because his lectures are so engaging great choice for child psych
3.5,W,her lectures are thorough but dry and copious notes are required to retain the relatively unimportant details that seem to pop up on the might be a better prof for a course that interests her more but i recommend taking departmental with her if it can be avoided
4.5,W,professor sparks is an absolute delight and her classes are highly informative intellectually stimulating and has a sophisticated veneer but is actually incredibly warm more so than most other professors when you go to see her in office hours and really validates participation in but fair
1.5,W,okay so this was one of the most boring classes i have ever had she has this monotonous voice that drains the life out of you she simply reads off her notes and looks up once in a while yes her exams are hard but not the problem the unstimulating lectures that kills the fun out of english class dreadful class avoid
3.5,W,last night i dreamt i went to sparkyville again i know that i could never go back but i would like to professor sparks is one of the most effective instructors in the department her lectures made me feel like oliver twist for i truly wanted more take her class learn quite a lot and you will enjoy it
3.5,M,do not expect to coast through his class do not expect him to give you answers go to him with problems and he will lead you to solutions he wont give you the solution he will lead you to it and leave you to figure out how to drink if you want to learn you will learn a lot from him
1.5,M,this is by far the worst teacher i have ever had in a philosophy class he discusses environmental issues it is also a how-to for moodle never seen a teacher go so crazy with that website
1.0,M,terrible teacher was forced to take the class due to fig he had hundreds of hours worth of homework that had nothing to do with the class asked for help and support several times and he was helpless avoid at all costs
4.5,M,very passionate about computer science he gets really excited when talking about certain topics he keeps the mood up with lots of geeky computer jokes labs and projects are challenging but not too difficult if you pay attention if you like computer science you will enjoy the class he require a textbook either
4.5,M,if you come to class be fine spent a lot of time covering certain topics and then rushed through others very helpful if you go to his office hours but beware he may sit and talk to you for hours if nobody else is waiting knows a lot about his topic and overall is a very good professor
3.0,M,his classes are fun and entertaining really smart guy but kind of disorganized in his teaching methods extremely practical you are not clear as to how to study for the exams
3.5,W,chase is such a nice professor she loves physics many old exams floating around which aids studying her exams are not difficult per se but one must prepare a lot buy keeping up w trying problems over and over chase passed me w a i averaged a w the final lab counts as a test grade too and i think i got roughly a avg got me a passing grade i was a senior and went to talk to her though
4.5,M,barden was awesome and did a great job of making microbio interesting very helpful especially when you talk to him outside of lecture the class itself is about the same difficulty as bio and just a lot of memorization of slides there are always free points and extra credit questions on his tests and best of all you do not need the book
4.0,M,he is very nice and wants to help if you go to him for help read the material before class to actually understand what he is saying rewatching the lectures before the test also helps
1.5,M,i studied my butt off for weeks before exams books previous tests and still got blindsided and absolutely bombed the tests withdrawing was better than risking my gpa on maybe scale it because he did last year i even went to him for guidance after exam i was talked down at and out of his office talk about not caring
4.5,W,best person ever she does get off topic but the things she talks about are so interesting even if everything you say is bull she will still listen and relate it to the class and make you feel smart once i thought a paper i wrote deserved an f and i ended up getting a
1.5,M,johnston is the sort of teacher that probably should have retired twenty years ago his classes are great if you want to listen to him complain about his personal life for an hour and a half but if you actually want to learn something you better find another teacher he have clear grades and very articulate either
2.0,M,i can say very honestly that i learned nothing he actually discussed what a cowboy is what a cowgirl is the fact that young woman love horses and really anything but geography he was very scatter brained unorganized and unclear three eight hour long field trips so this should be more like a six credit course do not take his classes
3.0,M,took rudi for geography of colorado a really nice guy but a little scattered in his lectures he had required field trips which i actually enjoyed they may be prohibitive for some students as it required driving our own vehicles or carpooling far distances ne colorado and vail valley not my favorite professor but informative enough
4.0,W,dr polin is one of the remaining few professors of education i know who actually give real grades she expects her students to work and think she is an amazing mentor to those who show up to learn she is a nightmare for those who show up to get by
5.0,M,he is amazing i have taken two classes with him he sometimes has paper assignments but not difficult it is more of your opinion on the matter being discussed in class you learn so much i decided on minoring in chicano studies after taking him my first year
5.0,M,helpful clear allows you a good amount of freedom in his papers
5.0,M,avdulov-sensei will change your life his classes are rigorous although not necessarily difficult to do well in dedication and attendance are mandatory however if you put forth the effort he will make sure you get an a in his course he is both professional and enthusiastic and integrates both japanese culture and language into his lessons
5.0,M,took this class language with him again saw two sides i recommend this to everyone its very light fun an amazing person and professor and is very passionate about japanese language and culture if you took japanese with him but not this be afraid of this like a totally different prof in this class then what he is in jpns
3.0,M,seen two sides of him he is very passionate about japanese culture and language as am i however as a language professor his course is very rigorous and demanding requires a large time dedication regardless of your willingness to learn the language and this may interfere with other courses if taking this as an elective doing bsc
5.0,W,she is the sweetest woman on campus cares so much about the students and preparing them for success in the class and in the real world weekly reading assignments and quizzes questions are given with the reading and if you answer them you will do fine on the quiz two midterms and a final all open note so take good notes final optional
5.0,W,great teacher very helpful tests are clear and she prepares you well great at explaining things gives great examples
2.0,M,he is smart as hell but really teach he just wrote on the board without consideration for the existence or uniqueness of any audience deciphering missing steps from the board was like solving a puzzle and there much value in going to class i went anyway lots of independent learning was needed nice exam very challenging
3.0,W,prof perry is a very unorganized but she makes up for it with a lot of extra credit i can honestly say that if you study what she gives in her study guides then you should be good she require finals for people who have and above and trust me i had like a cause of the extra credit
1.0,W,skips through power point slides in lecturesthen go back to them but moves on to other power points say much towards slides devastating how she give time to write down info from slides all she says is on blackboard how are we suppose to learn this way we pay to take the class for what to teach ourselves
2.0,W,get the book her powerpoints have much to do with on the test grades on a curve over all easy class
2.0,W,get the book her powerpoints have much to do with on the test overall easy class just have to learn on your own
2.0,W,really nice and funny but she is all over the place her powerpoints and lectures are interesting but rarely have anything to do with her tests she covers alot of material but you know where to start when you study her little study guides very useful either she curves her tests so that helps tremendously okay overall
2.5,W,very easy class she curves her tests so receiving a b is easy the powerpoints and study guides help much with tests i never read the textbook and still received an a i have a in the clas
1.0,W,boring instructor all she did was lecture from the book and test what i learned was strictly from reading questions are not welcome
5.0,M,my experience with dr greg detweiler made me choose a different career path originally i pursued music as a hobby i graduated from msu with a degree in political science through his support and guidance i now coach voiceover and have a successful career in the arts it started with concert choir and ended with practice
3.0,W,cynthia is a really nice and knowledgeable lady she use the book so i waste your money she is all over the place when it comes to when things are due or whats going on in the class in general shes really frustrating in regard to any type of class schedule and you have to remind her of things several times
5.0,W,cynthia is awesome i never write these reviews but i wanted to for this class because she is fabulous she actually makes the subject material make sense she has a real passion for what she teaches shes very prompt at answering emails and is extremely helpful i am hoping to have her again as an instructor
4.0,M,jim was great and was usually always prepared for lectures he oftentimes went over indie games and how well designed some of them are this helped contribute to our design decisions he met up with each team each week and gave critical brutal advice not all of it was gold but he definitely helped us especially with art direction
1.5,M,he is a nice guy but should not be teaching game design classes he gives horrible advice that drove our project into the ground he understand games at all if you take any of the senior capstone classes with him it would probably be in your favor to ignore what he advises you change about your game which is to say everything
4.0,M,he is a good professor he teaches well although e dies stray off topic sometimes
1.5,W,although she clearly knows what she is talking about she is not clear when teaching she acts as if you are stupid if you ask questions in class the one good thing i have to say is that she is much nicer outside of class and gladly gives you help if you ask for it only outside of class
2.5,W,professor class is very easy and it is chock-full of extra credit however she teach very well and makes students do online tutorial quizzes about the content you can keep redoing them until you get it right she also seems to get flustered at any questions that fit right into her framework
5.0,W,i am a recent graduate and nina was my saving grace at cmu she provided creative outlets through choir and challenged me to be the great musician that i became over my years as a vocal student i had several voice teachers but nina was the one that taught me the most about music and responsibility do yourself a favor and join her choirs
4.5,W,never physically met her but she responed to emails promptly i enjoyed the class we used the test and the tests came right from that make sure to study for exams lots of memorization and cover a lot of material
5.0,M,great professor smart sharp understanding always willing to answer questions i took two of his classes during the summer tests are hard study the lectures pay attention in class attendance not mandatory but he will give hints for the testsquizzes get a good group in i wish more were like him would take again
5.0,M,professor hage is awesome take his class i drive minutes to get to class but i do not regret it his notes are very clear and his test are based on his notes if you study your notes before test you would pass his class with a good grade
5.0,M,tony is an amazing teacher for those students who understand the hype it is because some of us just get chemistry but he makes us feel like it comes naturally i dropped another professor tacked on extra miles to be in his class would do it again i really hope he considers teaching organic chem take his class
4.5,M,professor hage is an amazing instructor he not only has great analogies for learning chemistry but also gives plenty of review and instruction for his students hage made himself available prior toafter class for specific questions over lecture material i clear on in class participation goes a long way with professor hage
3.5,M,tony is a competent professor his lectures are understandable and he answers questions in a mostly clear manner however one thing that was annoying to me was how he bragged every other week about his amazing ratings on this website and the awards he got from the school because of them no offense but he certainly does not live up to the hype
5.0,M,tony hage is hands-down one of the best teachers ever had if not the best i taken chemistry in probably years graduated hs a long time ago so the fact that i did so well is a testament to his teaching ability he breaks things down so they are easy to understand does tons of in-class an excellent person
5.0,M,one of the best teachers i have ever had in my anyone who struggles with chemistry take this teacher he is extremely clear in his teaching and goes above and beyond for his students he lectures in a way where his students can understand and encourages questions never met a person so kind
5.0,M,great professor my chemistry was good in high school but this professor made it even easier to understand for me with great explanation and examples he knows the chemistry really well u can almost ask any question and he knows the answer really great personality with a lot of knowledge
5.0,M,just like all the rest of these reviews i concur he is the best teacher ever he makes chemistry fun if you ever get the chance to take his class do it you will appreciate chemistry for the rest of your life i took his class over years ago amazing professor
2.0,M,perfect teacher if you can teach yourself math so just come for quizzes to ask what will be on the quizzes which he will tell you his accent writing is rough take if dependent on teacher explanation very generous with points on tests attempts will get you far weekly quizzes midterms final
3.5,M,the only reason i took this professor is because he grades on a straight scale is a is a etc his lectures are a bit confusing as he unnecessarily explains things and ends up making it make less sense i just used the book to teach myself most of the material and since an easy grader got an a in the class
1.5,M,really tough class he is very hard to understand and his lectures are really confusing for some reason his example problems come out unnecessarily long and confusing tough time keeping up mostly studied on my own quizzes and tests are pretty hard although i question his grading because his answer key make sense caution when taking
3.5,M,dr zhang does not have the greatest of english but the man is a master of math for his lectures if you can get past the wordage and minor broken english then they are a great source of info gives partial credit galore also gives credit for showing knowledge of material ran out of time showed i knew how to do it with indicators fx and got
2.5,M,he was hard yeah but this is college differential equations is not supposed to be a walk through the park i went to every lecture and asked questions i would spend hours every day at the library studying for just this class but again this is college what did you expect put in the work and get an a
2.5,M,the majority of the exam had content on it that was not covered very well i hope you understand math and word problems if you take him
1.5,M,very nice and knowledgeable man doesnt have the best or most useful lectures but if you ask him a question he will answer it if you ask him a question on the he will definitely help you out if you do the assigned homework will be a breeze if you dont mind learning on your own go ahead and take him
1.0,M,by far the worst teacher i have ever had he is probably one of the most brilliant at wayne state but does not know how to teach by any means he spends whole entire classes doing proofs and does not even teach on what we actually need to know for his impossible tests i will say he is helpful during his office hours i recommend him to no one
4.5,M,he was a great prof made the class very interesting and easy to follow able to really keep your attention i really enjoyed the class
5.0,M,prof vyse has done a great job sparking my interest in psychology he does a great job keeping the class engaged with his helpful powerpoint slides succinct explanations of main ideas and integration of out-of-textbook materials he will make you work hard but you will learn a lot in addition he is very kind and has a good sense of humor
4.0,M,an excellent prof teaches really well explains everything clearly and is very helpful if you go during his office hours however his exams are very tricky so you might want to get your concepts clear solve his past exams make sure you really understand the solutions and you should be good
2.0,M,this was probably the worst experience i have ever had if you are a female forget it if you correct him when he is wrong forget it he thinks he can grade you at the end of the semester by just what he thinks my a was brought down to an a because of it
1.0,M,this class is easy but professor is horrible at explaining and a lazy unfair grader he is even worse when you try to contact him for any issue whether it be class related or advising related his jokes are not funny at all grab the handout and leave the class fortunately for you the handout does a better job of explaining than he does
4.5,M,very clear and great in lecture he grades his tests tough but if you know the notes and do all of the practice problems they that bad
3.5,M,he clear about what he wanted if you want an a make sure that the shapes you draw are neat and there are no messes outside and inside of the border no matter how ugly your painting is he accepts it as long as neat and it is based on the guidelines he also lets you to redo any assignment and turn it in
1.5,W,she is a good teacher but not very helpful to the students on a equal level
3.0,M,my advice skip class do the homework problems and ask for help if you need it horn goes straight to the tutoring lab every day after class and if you ask for help he gladly will underestimate the exams try to study with someone else who is in the class teaching each other and learning together will help you more than book work
1.0,M,take chemistry from horn he is more concerned about how your are participating in his pogil project then teaching sometimes he answers students questions hit and miss most of time spent working in groups very little lecture homework solutions are hidden by the professor does not teach engaged learning at uvu
1.0,M,he puts you in a group of and gives you chemactivities to work on every day he lectures for min and then leaves you with your group to figure out how to do chemistry when i asked him a question he responded look it up in the book this is a teach yourself class expect to learn anything from him worst teacher ever had
4.0,M,he is actually funny and very passionate about chemistry he understands that this class is a lower level chemistry class and require you to know things above this class he responds to questions quickly and helped with any problem i had you are responsible to teach yourself this class is in no way a breeze go to class and read your book
4.0,M,this class requires alot of self teaching i liked the class and the group that i was assigned to you must go to class he does in class clicker questions that are graded he responded to questions very quickly read the book make sure you know your stuff because its up to you to learn the material he lecture in class at all
3.5,W,do believe the hype dr richards is funny honest and fair she requires you to buy the book the questions for the midterm and final come mainly from them dont use your phone in class she hates that she gave the whole class a makeup quiz because we didnt follow her instructions on the midterm i loved the class and learned alot
1.0,W,dont do it i took this class online for a ge over the summer hour long films from the sfsu library every day boring no lecture every single one of her emails was condescending and rude did not do any teaching herself she just piled on the work and sent rude emails about how students never put in work or effort avoid at all costs
1.5,W,focuses too much on student misbehaviors no extra credit will kick you out of class if you text mandatory attendance give students enough motivation to truly succeed and help them knows subject material well but acts far too superior over her students very difficult final exam and paper thankful i was able to pass this class
4.0,W,pretty easy class as long as you actually put some thought into the essays and reports extremely nice and helpful professor attendance is not mandatory however she did take attendance daily lectures could be pretty boring but helpful when you understand the material all the lectures consisted of her explaining the reading
2.0,W,sweeet lady that loves her in-n-out not into this class made me not want to take interest in philosophy even more class was boring and i attend of the time except on test days passed with an a because i actually did a bit of reading for the tests and i took the assignments seriously
3.5,W,professor hood loves her in-n-out throughout the semester she used burgers and donuts and used them to make philosophical arguments which was pretty hilarious though her lectures dragged on and were most of the time boring i still learned some interesting stuff when i read the book and wrote the essays do your best on the tests and papers
5.0,W,easy class readings are sometimes confusing but just do your best email her for any concerns or questions she is approachable overall do your best and it should be a chill class
4.5,W,easy class if looking to boost your take her class it consisted of tests which are pretty straight forward questions are always welcomed and answered in a clear way great class overall the key to doing well is to not over-think things
4.0,M,harvey arrogant he is just extremely intelligent world politics is not a light subject and he expects that people are intelligent enough to see both sides of arguments loved his class he was super helpful when i emailed him a question and i believe my exams were marked very fairly the final was difficult
3.5,M,dr harvey was a fantastic professor passionate about the subject matter often made jokes which lightened up the fact that it was a longer class and was friendly when approached with questions great class great teacher hard material but strongly recommend to political science majorsminors also he posts all the readings online to save
3.5,W,joann is great she really wants all her students to succeed and is always available to help you out if you have any questions she taught a flipped instruction course which required a lot of studyingonline lectures for homework but her lectures class activities always make the material easy to understand love her
4.0,W,lots of physics involved not a mathematical genius so this class and the were slightly confusing at times overall a good class though i really received the help i needed when i needed it i would recommend her
5.0,M,i loved this professor his way of teaching his notes are very helpful would take him again especially if taken other professor for same class see the difference passed his class with a b without any tutoringgroup studyingreading book so if you try a little more then i did sure get an a do just fine
3.0,W,super sweet lady but be prepared her slides are not posted on blackboard nothing is and the slides are really the entire book put on power point if pressured for time she gives a study guide for the exams but its just as long as her power points she is very mum on what to expect for exams i feel im going in to it exams blind
4.5,W,although the tests are tough she is usually pretty generous with grading in the end if you participate and show up to class she is quite hilarious and tries to make the subject as painless as possible
5.0,W,i have never had a professor care as much as dr sweely she genuinely cares about her students you have to take her as a teacher
3.5,M,prof mccauley got straight to the point during his lectures never went off topic he was a pretty understanding prof although it always seemed like he was in a rush to leave class the class was usually very quiet so he would always end class early pretty easy marker always takes attendance but can sometimes be intimidating overall good prof
5.0,M,he takes attendance at the beginning of each lecture his lectures are not long and they are very clear he posts them on his website so you have to go crazy jotting down everything his exams come from the slides usually a few mc concepts and an essay q he is a fair marker there is also a essay he is also very understanding
4.5,M,is one of my favorite professor at york very easy to approach and his teaching is very clear all tests or exams are based on the lectures powerpoint study the lecture slides on his website and attend lectures regularly you will definitely do well in this course prof mccauley made sociological theories more interesting
3.5,M,good proof gets straight to the point know what he s talking about
4.5,M,dr fisher taught the first half of the semester of my class and i really enjoyed taking his class he explained everything very well and always made sure to answer questions sufficiently the best part of his class is his great sense of humor that makes each class interesting without taking academic value away from the class
3.5,M,dr fisher was a great professor i liked his lectures he tried to keep it interesting and sometimes share a scrap of his personal life he tries to answer any questions during a lecture i never used office hours but i knew they were available his tests bad compared to other bio professors bio is just a hard course overall
2.5,M,you have to read the textbook or you pass any quizzes or tests quizzes are worth and each exam is majority of the time his quizzes based on his lectures
1.5,M,i do not recommend his class to anyone who is not a history fanatic he assigns an ungodly amount of reading and has quizzes every week with other assignments as well he is not clear when you ask him how you should study if you can take another professor i highly recommend it he also had midterms and finals super hard class to pass
4.0,M,i really liked him i took his class on-line he does a lot of discussion boards and you have to write a few papers but he is a very good instructor i learned a lot from his class
3.0,W,really confusing at times so try to pay attention she is very serious about only talking in spanish from the minute you walk in the door you have chapter tests and have lots of temas every week having the text book is a must you spend most of class talking to other people over microphones in spanish so if you social good luck
1.0,W,by far the worst teacher i have had wish i paid more attention to her reviews majority are accurate save yourself the headache
5.0,W,great teacher im taking her class right now and that is the best class i have this semester shes funny and full of good jokes while talking about the book read the book and do the hw and you will pass her class with an easy a oh and participate to the conversations because mrs allen has a grade for participation take her class
4.0,W,she is nice and a very social person her tests are relatively simple as long as you study and know terms and common sense she is a teacher you will definitely remember after the class
1.0,M,i took his online class and pretty sure be the toughest teacher ever have the tests are unbearable his feedback and instructions are unclear he expects things he ask for the tests are long essays and you only have to write them not kidding i recommend him at all
2.0,M,this is class is pretty easy but very boring his class lectures are pointless and you need to take notes because they give you no information needed for is a hard grader but i find it hard to believe anyone could fail this is out of the books and he lets you do all your work at home prior to
3.5,W,i have taken three of dr classes at cscc now she is a wonderful teacher all of the classes i have taken have been online and dr lape makes instructions clear she grades fairly and offers wonderful feedback on papers i highly recommend her classes i am an english major and her classes have deepened my love of literature top notch
3.0,W,lets see for this online class she has made us read about different small readings per week and then is knowing small quotes from all the readings over the past weeks are you kidding me she is a critical grader and unorganized sure nice in person but take online unless the only class you take ridiculous
4.0,M,perkins is friendly and will certainly help you understand the material he actually wrote the course textbook so the course is very consistent the work itself is very difficult and requires an immense amount of practicememorization to master makes you realize the level of commitment required to go into accounting though
3.0,M,this class is not as easy as he comes across like it is study all material before test good guy though
4.5,W,very great professor i had her for two classes and she mentored me for my student teaching yes she does get off topic but she has great stories and so much knowledge regarding special needs students her class required writing of reflections for each class
3.5,W,going to class was really important for filling in the study guides and notes she provided if you studied those the class was pretty easy it was a little boring but definitely not bad she gives extra credit quizzes can be taken an unlimited amnt of times that were worth up to extra points for our grade good class
5.0,M,this course is absolutely a difficult course regardless of the professor you have if not invested in learning russian then gerry is not the professor for you he is brutally tough but he is an excellent teacher and makes sure that you learn russian correctly and to a good level of proficiency
4.5,M,steve is a very good teacher he takes an interest in students and helps encourages i enjoyed his class because he treats you with fairness and respect
4.0,M,really great teacher who wants everyone to be on the same page and will go out of his way to make sure you know whats going on long lectures and even longer tests with some last minute marking but overall a stellar time
5.0,M,briggs is an excellent teacher he cares about his students and helps you succeed with understanding self defense tactics
4.0,M,such a great class he brought in people from nike who showed un-reveled products he is a great person to make friends with and a respected recommendation letter and the quizzes every day are easy
5.0,M,dr ryan is an amazing creative storyteller and is renowned in the multimedia community for his skills and expertise during my time with him we had many influential people come in as guest lecturers including the creative director for coca-cola design moguls and renowned faculty get to know him stay after class and participate it will help
1.0,W,elle feth is awful her lectures are not only boring but incredibly complicated and far too detailed the tests and assignments are easy but in the end end up regretting taking the course the testa are straightforward however she uses confusing language and will not clarify do not take this course with her
3.0,M,the class was mostly discussion and lecture based the topics were fairly interesting and he made handouts of all the information we needed to know quiz and exam questions come straight from his handouts not a very tough grader and not the most interesting professor either but the class was very easy
1.0,M,this class was absolutely miserable there is no clear syllabus and or curriculum two twenty minute presentations or a page paper so tough on grading and shows little respect for his students i dropped my minor because of this do not take this class
1.5,M,this professor seems like a nice person but his class is miserable no clear curriculum lectures are confusing and make no sense pain in the butt about attendance and participation literally nothing makes sense in his class he seemed to play favorites gives out and b i am trying to avoid any of his other classes
5.0,M,professor ghorashi is an excellent professor if you are a decent student he cares about whether you learn so he requires active participation and studying if you do this and are careful to take very good notes in class this course will be easy taking good notes and paying attn in class is key to doing well on exams
2.0,M,we use the textbook he made us get there is a quiz every week with open ended questions not easy i missed class because i had a bad cold and i emailed him asking him what homework i needed to do and he refused to tell me and i got a for it picks on you if you look tired even if paying attention you never get out of class early
3.5,M,ghorashi is a very good professor economics is a challenging subject nonetheless if you commit to understanding the concepts rather than memorizing you can do well in his class there are only exams so make them count there is very little chance to get grades elsewhere there is no homework
5.0,M,professor thielen was awesome he allows you to use your study guides on the tests making them easier if you like purchasing textbooks find someone who can share theirs with you you will need it you might get some last minute cancellations and he allows you unexcused absences but he makes class interesting enough i recommend him
5.0,M,dr thielen was probably the best professor ever had at pvcc he is helpful considerate and so clear in his direction i learned a lot from his class he comes highly recommended as long as willing to really do the work read the book and study for the tests
5.0,M,mr thielen was an excellent teacher the subject matter was not to difficult he made coming to class a joy he is very charismatic and you can tell he enjoys what his work
5.0,W,best professor by far she is one of the few that truly cares about the well-being of her students as a result she devotes considerable time and effort into improving her students and preparing them for life after graduation she is also extremely approachable i am a better person because of her
5.0,W,best professor by far she is one of the few that truly cares about the well-being of her students as a result she devotes considerable time and effort into improving her students and preparing them for life after graduation many students mirror these sentiments but some do not truly realize how much she has helped them until later down the ro
5.0,W,dr mcfadden is an excellent professor she goes out of her way to ensure students learn the material the cases in this class helps with real world application there is a team research paper that further enhances your learning there are tests and one non-cumulative final an a is attainable but you must work for it overall a professor
5.0,W,dr mcfadden is one of the high knowledge teachers came across in my college career she has a passion for teaching the students and genuinely wants you to learn and succeed she enjoys the topic and you can tell it is her passion most of the real world experience she draws from is in healthcare and aviation one of my favorite niu professors
2.5,W,class is easy until the final a lot of math problems that are hard never take both of her classes at once it is unbearable she has no understanding that students have other classes in addition to hers she is arrogant and mean not approachable
1.0,W,if this is the only class you have she is great but most likely that is not the case i had more homework in this class than all of my other classes combined she thinks she is the best person in the world always brags about her being on cnn she also talks about airlines like there the best thing in the world and bashes the healthcare feild
5.0,M,a very kind sweet man people are critical of him for no reason at all clearly bright and enthusiastic even when others are not
2.0,M,awful does not know how to lecture nor teach anyone anything i studied and also had a tutor be lucky to get a high b he teaches all application so you have basically no idea when taking the test i know ers students cannot avoid him but be prepared
5.0,W,dr sipple is absolutely amazing her discussions are always interesting and never fail to get me thinking i love most of the books read and she brings up points that i have thought of otherwise in addition to this super understanding and kind recommend her any day
1.0,M,not a great speaker we use our class book at all required reading is a big part of this class lectures are long and boring he seems awkward and says um times per class take another professor
1.5,M,he is very monotone and not very helpful only test grades and a lot of reading
1.5,M,the worst lectures to be present for so monotone and boring asks if there are any questions and then acts like you are inconveniencing him when you actually do have one i would never recommend his courses to anyone
4.0,W,she was very nice and her class was easy enough two take home exams that need your book for and three paper all of which being relatively short she does get a little sidetracked during her lectures but not too much to not get through the notes i would definitely take her other courses teaching if need be
2.5,M,dr eierman is just okay sometimes he expects you to know everything and when you ask help from him be you should know this yeah if i knew everything i come to you and ask for help his test are pretty okay if you study well from his study guides
5.0,M,he really made class interesting and marked really fairly
5.0,M,he is an awesome prof i loveee his class very interesting stuff and he makes them so easy to understand thanks prof bartel
4.5,M,the best professor i have had at york he is so passionate about his work and extremely engaging one of the only classes that i found time flew by during lectures i would highly recommend rearranging your schedule to take his class if you go to class and read his notes you will do well he often reuses his quiz questions on the midterm final
3.0,M,i fee like he actually knew much about the subject drugs and behavior he read directly from the powerpoint he never was able to properly answer questions from students when they came up in class
4.5,W,so knowledgeable and so kind an amazing lecturer however a lot of what her lectures cover in intro to cinema studies is exactly what is covered in the readings
5.0,W,corinn columpar was the best cinema studies professor i had at the university of toronto she is very confident in her understanding of film theory and she elucidates her thoughts eloquently and efficiently she made me see film in an entirely new way and grateful for the perspective she gave me take her classes
1.5,W,the lectures and tutorials are a joke they consist of re-gurgitated summary of the text book chapters reading and quotes and she goes off into tangents about her interests in art history music a bit of a money grab scheme to intentionally force students to pay extra for academic readings when she could easily chose readings off of jstor
2.5,M,lectures are long if a visual learner have a hard time trying to learn all the information he gives you all the lectures are on his website in pdf format and exactly what he uses during his lectures rarely writes on the board tests are very tricky truefalse and matching if you love micro think about taking him
5.0,M,rose is amazing helpful he really made me regain interest drive in my intended profession as a rn one of those teachers you will always class was tough but he makes the information fun he loves to ramble off about random but he is entertaining and opens your eyes to a whole new world in the healthcare field
5.0,M,excellent teacher keeps my attention the entire class in his and has been teaching at the college for years he is a national treasure miss taking a class from him
4.0,W,a lot of reading involved in this class essays are kind of long toward the end of the semester but she is willing to help would take again

5.0,M,hyde is probably my favorite professor at spscc interesting engaging and knows what the hell talking about his stories spice up his lectures and the information he shares is really interesting i learned more in the classes i took with hyde than in any other classes and it was incredibly easy if on the fence do it
5.0,M,i am obsessed with david hyde i am majoring in sociology and have taken every class he has at sps he should be teaching at the university level because he is a walking talking genius if you print out the pp notes at the start of class and follow along with lectures taking notes on you go wrong every day is interesting
5.0,M,had him for emac my freshman year of art college great teacher super helpful and knowledgable of what teaching class has a lot of freedom but also just enough structure great lecturer as well highly recommend jason
2.0,W,very nice teacher good on grading but hard to understand hand her handwriting also hard to understand her accent she is all over the place can be very confusing
5.0,W,this professor was amazing i enjoyed every minute and she is soo good at teaching if anyone needs to com class take her

4.5,M,my tips for anyone taking a class with blitz do not come to class unprepared participate enjoy yourself he is awesome a little scary sometimes but he really wants his students to do well
5.0,M,teaches with sarna both are great blitz can be hilarious but is also very serious about students doing their work he seems to know a lot about a lot of things never boring tough grader not tolerant of laziness at all probably best teacher had at jj
4.5,M,intelligent but also challenging he as difficult as i thought but you definitely need work hard
2.0,W,do not take her any way
5.0,M,hes really funny and cool i would love to take him again
1.5,M,gosh when i took this course psc fall i saw that he had good rating so i decided to take him i know why some people rated him stars on easiness you can not really understand his lecturers his voice are very low and exams are hard plus pages term papers the worse class i have ever had do not take him
3.0,M,do it his tests are not checked making some answers wrong that are right hard to understand thinks he is always right my last year in college and by far the worst professor had as of yet
3.0,W,i thought public health would be really interesting her tough grading is making me regret taking this class worked very hard on all of my homework assignments but there always seems to be a problem when she tells me to fix something and i do then something else is wrong
4.5,M,this guy is amazing he has a thick accent yes but if you come to class and show that you truly care you are fine i absolutely love him i hate that we have to use avid as the main editing software but he will help you all you need to do is go to him he is so inspirational cant wait to take his ap class
3.5,M,camilo can be hard to understand with his accent and some of his assignments very clear cut the class can be tough at times and a stickler for doing things his way however i think an amazing person the class been hard but glad i took it with him
4.5,M,camilo is literally by far the best professor i have ever had at dutchess everything want in a professor if you are interested in the subject and willing to work hard every day he is hilarious witty and always willing to help with whatever he really strives for your absolute best and does not accept any bs
2.5,M,i learned a lot in his classes gets u to work hard good very passionate about the can be good and bad in this case good u can learn as much as in a known film sch at the community coll also bad if u get too that still a community coll crse for credit for a degree balance
1.0,W,her attitude shifts from one class to the next she acts like she is only there to draw a paycheck her teaching is vague and dependent on her emotion she can be very rude even if you try your hardest she dismisses it if possible find a better instructor for stats and probability even with her credentials i question her scientific capability
1.0,W,worst teacher ever i swear every time i walked into that class my iq dropped the teacher is late all the time except when there a test being given complicates the lesson does not know how to teach and bother asking questions she just laughs and makes you keep guessing before telling you the answer and wastes half the class time doing so
1.0,W,she is the worst college professor i have ever took because she is not helpful at all and encourage students to pass the class including me of course that is why i failed this class also she give extra credit and pre-test reviews in fact she is more like hal from a space odyssey than a professor
1.5,W,i am currently taking her class and she does rush through the material she is late sometimes the tests are graded strictly she review before tests because students do not feel they can ask questions my advice is to seek tutoring however you can take the departmental exam to opt out repeating which is what i might due
1.0,W,she is the worst professor that i took because she is not helpful at all
2.5,W,ok not that she laughs at you is her way even when you are right she laughs but if you are not good at math take her she expects you to know what you are suppose to know no extra nothing what you got is what you are going to get she help you with extra points she does not encourages you nice but tough not easy class
2.0,W,because she a native english speaker she can be confusing when she is lecturing she mixes up the definitions of words you have to do pointless check up homeworks for every class when most of the time she will lecture on that material later on as i said pointless she grades your work not according to the methods but correctness
3.5,W,i really liked prof dogru and enjoyed her class her quizzes were not too hard and as long as you payed attention did your homework and tried you would do well when you understand something just ask she is always willing to change her ways and explain in a way that may make more sense to her students
4.5,W,she was extremely helpful she is the best professor i have ever had even though dr dogru teach in a style i was used to she tried very hard to help her students understand the material not just how to solve the problems i would definitely recommend her
1.5,W,how dr dogru taught was very frustrating she was hard to understand at times due to her accent and her somewhat poor english made newly explained concepts more confusing got a good grade but had to spend a lot of time figuring out concepts on my own she marks things wrong but doesnt explain why extremely nice lady not a good professor
4.5,W,professor dogru is extremely nice very approachable and always willing to explain concepts until everyone understands easy to listen to for those hour courses and gives a break if you need it i would definitely recommend professor dogru to any student taking mth she made retaking a breeze
5.0,M,his tests are difficult because of the short responses but he is a great and passionate teacher
4.0,M,the best professor ever loves to joke around but he definitely makes you have an interest for science requires lots of studying if you study pass his class if not struggle
4.5,M,professor arminio is awesome he explains topics very well has flexible office hours for extra help announces exams well in advance and loves to give pop quizzes these quizzes really pop though as he always says to expect one soon arminio also gives great advice about future schools to apply to overall he is the best
5.0,M,best professor in mdc i acquired an interest in science after taking this class he gives vocab quizzes that you have get from the book and gives handouts to study for the test if you study you will get an a i did
2.5,M,i took his week course for earth science definitely not an easy a but he gives u chances to improve grade with quizzes book wasnt neccessary
3.0,M,pretty condescending towards non-native english speakers his essay corrections are often very unclear and difficult to learn from claims to be a generous grader but in reality is harsher more nit-picky and less forgiving grader to be fair he always offers private office hours to those who need it i unfortunately did not benefit much frm thos
5.0,M,hade a fun day with kerry at my house and hope to hang out with him again
3.5,W,dr fresolla is a great lecturer makes you connect the dots is she tough yeah but not horrible test is challenge but it is a wake up call and makes you realize that this is nursing and one cannot compartmentalize knowledge however this is the test that will eliminate many be prepared for it and respect it she is nursing boot camp
4.0,W,dr fressola was tough but a great clinical instructor she make it easy but she respected that we were students and would tell us if we were making mistakes she was very good about being professional when telling you about mistakes she always had you step off the floor for comments i learned a lot from her and i am very thankful
3.0,W,surprised to see that people had a positive experience with dr fressola she is disrespectful and condescending towards students as someone whose original background is in teaching her behavior is appalling my dislike for her and her contempt for us did however motivate me to refuse to ever fail her exam i passed out of spite
1.5,W,most unorganized teacher i have ever had she is a very sweet woman who will work with you depending on what you have going on in your life but she assigns more homework than she can even grade thanksgiving break is next week and i have not gotten one grade back all year all of the homework is tedious and you basically teach yourself
4.0,M,you need the book for his class if you want to pass the test he gives you the test on angel then you take the test once again in class i would suggest make friends and split up the test by chapter amongst yourselfs to make it easier you need to take notes so even bother
3.0,M,not great dont take him tests are way to hard
5.0,M,amazing professor i wish i can take him again for another class

5.0,M,he is the best college professor i have ever had his classes are very interesting and he is very flexible and funny
4.5,M,if you can take dukes and avoid lofton do it your life will be so much easier he is a great stats teacher and i hated the subject he is easy and helpful and it is nearly impossible to get an a in any other cj stats course
5.0,W,dr albanesi is by far the greatest professor that i have taken at uccs i thought i was going to hate this class but she made it incredibly interesting and it ended up being one of the best classes that i have taken during my undergrad she is incredibly knowledgeable and her lectures are riveting
5.0,W,i wrote my paper for this class before the semester started and did well with it she gives weekly quizzes instead of something like or exams and it generally helps keeps grades up she is the sweetest lady with a great sense of humor she is very smart and fun
2.5,W,this class is hard when it have to be she spends an incredible amount of time going over things like how to find mean and median and not enough going over new concepts she does let you use notes for one test and drops your lowest grade i got an a but the class was much more challenging than it should have been
1.0,W,easy class but she is rude not helpful at all tells you your answer is wrong and that be that the lectures can be a bit confusing but the math is not hard to comprehend take her if you feel comfortable with the subject must take it but she is kind of awful
1.0,M,horrible teacher ask questions his answer is either i think so or no i show examples cause it would take too much class think taking a week to go over the intro of each chapter takes more class time no one pays attention or shows up for lectures only good thing is he curves every test
1.0,M,i highly suggest that you take his online course very unorganized and is unclear with directions he takes forever to respond to emails he also grades your group as a whole for discussions instead of individually so you can get screwed over if your group participate which i thought was so unfair online exams are very difficult
4.0,M,nice guy gives you study guides for exams map quizzes if you actually study do well bother buying the book never used it goes over exam study guides in class and usually gives you the answers so note taking is a must once he cancelled class and i there the class before so i know and he send an email
3.5,M,great professor but something you should know right off the bat is that tests arent multiple choice theyre matching true and false and a type of fill in the blank he knows a lot of interesting facts but the textbook really necessary you need to study but he offers a lot of help you never use the textbook so buy it
3.5,M,at first i though this course was some sort of joke and this was what sociology was all about after taking two classes i realise this is bs do not take this class unless you want to hear about his disrespect you will not learn nothing
1.0,M,terrible professor was extremely easy for me to do the work in the class but because it all revolves around study guides and learning where countries were on the map i can assure you that this class is a waste of time and that this teacher will spend of the class time talking about his grandson or other things other then teaching
3.0,W,a very nice lady but this class is extremely boring she makes you do five papers throughout the semester on the in-class exercises which hard to do a very fair and easy grader there are four quizzes as a means of evaluation no tests which is nice the class hard but take another class for the gs credit
1.0,W,no if you are not good in math take her one of those professors who expect you to know everything before you came to class
5.0,W,she is great a little bit boring but makes sure everyone gets everything i guarantee after this class you will understand all you understand before gives a lot of homework but you have to turn it in however it helps a lot to do homework take her if you want to know math
5.0,W,she is good professor give a lot of homework but you will understand everything
5.0,W,she is the best professor i had to finally help me understand math i love her teaching style she just tell you how to do the problem but explains why something is for what it is the thing with math is there are sometimes more than one way to do a problem but she tells you her way and explains it well
5.0,M,great professor if i was majoring in astro physics definitely take more of his courses good teacher and takes the time to help you but he is pretty busy i went to every class and tried it was a small class and for those of us that tried i think we all did pretty well recommend him to anyone
5.0,W,hands down one of the nicest professors had so far she is extremely helpful and is always willing to go over the material if you were to ever have a question she even helps you out with the homework study the book and the notes and do the hw and you should be fine
5.0,W,great professor spend sometimes up to half an hour after class badgering her and answer and discuss every question whole-heartedly
1.0,M,you get yelled at if you follow his order suppose to help you not make you feel little self defense not a military class all i can say is take it with him
4.0,M,i loved this class i really learned a lot i recommend this class to others it helped me overcome a lot of hears i had he explains things well i hope to take additional classes with him too
4.0,M,mr martin is very passionate about his career and it shows he does offer extra credit which is very helpful during the semester you take tests and he drops the lowest grade very nice man and i do recommend him but please take it serious he is there for you
5.0,M,loved his class i just finished his class but i would take it all over very nice cool guy pretty easy class i recommend it
5.0,M,loved this class i recommend it to everyone with this prof he teaches things beyond the textbook and has helped me with life skills
3.5,W,i really liked professor iftode at first i was on the fence about her but as time went on she really grew on me the class is a little challenging but if you ask her questions she will always talk you through your confusion really sweet and a fairly easy grader participation definitely makes a difference too
2.5,W,good professor not very clear with what she wants so you may need to ask a few times to get the answer lots of papers so you better like to write you need to set aside at least an hour a night to get an a possible but tough
1.5,W,i take her for a class but i did attempt to be a part of her research had a meeting with her and she was completely rude my freshman year i got a c in calc while working two jobs and being a full-time bio major she let the c go i even told her i would quit my jobs to be more available nothing wasted mins in her office
3.0,W,she is a terrible lecturer but an easy grader read the textbook and do the practice problems she gives you before the exams she is very understanding and will move dates around if you really need her to she is a really nice lady and is always willing to help
4.0,M,tests no attendance very chill guy and you can tell he really knows what he is talking about lectures can be boring get the book and study his powerpoints and you can easily can a b or a best teacher if you have to take this class
2.5,M,he isnt very structured which makes it hard to write notes there are no powerpoints a lot of pointless examples he tries to make jokes that arent funny prefer someone else there are example test questions which are very helpful but the in-class questions do not have answers unless you get them when you go to class
4.0,M,great teacher really cool loved his class but really not for the sensitive a touch grader but i really enjoyed the class he makes it interesting
3.5,M,he gives a lecture every class and you watch a movie after that you need to attend class even if you have seen the movie in order to take notes he tells you what you need to know for the exams exams and one research project easy class he is sarcastic and funny you need to read the book
4.5,M,midterm final paper paper is extremely easy emphasize the extremely midterm final are both open notebook book come to class write down everything he says highlightunderline the ones that he says will be on the test print out the class lecture notes instead of copying it from the screen stay for the movies will be on tests
5.0,M,fantastic class you watch so many great films and he gives great in depth back story to each quizzes which are super easy and papers which are very manageable easy and a very awesome guy great sense of humor
3.5,M,super easy show up to class take some notes stay for the films only tests midterm and final both are open note and open book and one extremely easy paper no reason for anyone to get lower than a b a no bs kind of guy he knows what he is talking about
3.5,M,taken three film classes with sierra because not only is he awesomely cynical but you have to be a complete idiot to get anything lower than an a he makes all of his papers and quiz material extremely clear to follow this class is even enjoyable for non-film majors
5.0,M,one of the coolest professor he always make jokes and share personal experience to entertain and at the same time he has a extremely detailed note coverage makes along with online proof reading tests are from the reading if you have all of these prepared this class would be extremely entertaining and easy
4.5,M,ridiculously easy class he tells you what will be on the test as he lectures he can be really condescending at times by talking to the class like but i guess he is just frustrated that a lot of people somehow manage to fail this class
5.0,M,you will love this teacher very funny and you can tell he really know his stuff his lectures are very easy and fun to listen to many time he will hint out the mid term final answers during the lectures so prepare your grade will be based of a mid term essay and a final the tests are open so sweat easy a take him
1.0,M,he is by far the worst teacher ive ever had in my life he doesnt care if you fail or do well he was supposed to help me with doing a program with my internship and rarely answered any of my emails when i asked him what to do i messaged him at least four times a month for the entire summer and he answered times
4.5,M,definitely a course on the tougher side but i would take it again without thinking twice the information is extremely interesting his passion for it makes it so much better you definitely need to set aside an hour a day to look over the information from the class before then be golden he is an amazing person and teacher miss out
5.0,M,he was an amazing professor i learned a lot expect pop quizzes every week and a lot of memorization take this class you regret it

4.5,W,jans does an excellent job of teaching the basics and technical aspects of cinema while putting a spin on things great professor who cares that her class learn new perspectives from her lectures she is a solid grader and gave great feedback whenever i asked for it my writing skills have improved from taking this course
5.0,W,really enjoyed her class took it as a hybrid block class so it was very fast paced and all the assignments were submitted online she was very clear about how she wanted you to write and was very willing to help i would take her again i was very impressed with her teaching style
1.0,M,this professor has no concept of how to teach a class i should have read the warning signs he waits until the refund date for classes to actually assign homework his list of specifications took a full minute just to scroll through he double deducts points because he lists them in different ways do not take he enjoys taking points off
4.5,W,dr white is one of the best professors i have ever had she truly loves students and what she teaches she is like a mother in the classroom she is also really funny she gives pop quizzes a lot and there is assigned reading
5.0,W,great teacher knows what she is talking about super nice and funny explains things clearly

5.0,W,mrs mitchell is definitely the best teacher i ever had she is caring motivational and wants you to succeed she is brilliant and gives amazing lectures she can be a tough grader but clearly states what she is looking for be sure to participate in discussions she loves that mam will not only teach you theatre she will teach you life lessons
5.0,W,mam is inspirational this class was fun and thorough helping me learn about each play we analyzed she never says your answer is wrong but helps steer you into the right direction i would love to take this class again

1.0,W,she a fair grader offends her students honestly there are way better professors to take rather than her maybe outside of class sea better but probably not she divorced and angry it seems like
5.0,W,i had reid for and freshman seminar reid was a very understanding and amazing professor she knew that people got jitters speaking in front of crowds and penalize you for it she could tell who put work into their speech and she would grade accordingly always asked questions about your topic and was interested great professor
4.0,W,she was the best history teacher ever had in my life she was fair in her grading and even gave us extra credit multiple times i usually am not good at history but her lectures were actually so interesting she captures your attention and if you go to class she helps you understand the essay prompts and suggests general ideas
3.0,W,the questions for the papers are poorly defined and can lead to a lot of confusion when writing them fair grader very boring class you have to read the book online so there is very little reason to go to her class
5.0,W,a hilarious teacher with a sense of passion for what she does ask her about the most interesting roman leader and she will talk your ear off papers are tough but put in the time and get a good grade need the textbook for the papers overall an awesome professor
4.0,W,a weird class in my opinion was confused a lot of the time and not sure how all topics related to each other but her class is set up pretty clearly she gives reviews the class before the test and is pretty much exactly on it the prompts are hard to grasp for papers but i never got lower than an on one recommend still
5.0,M,i cannot understand how anyone can say that dr kent does not offer feedback he is always available after class and during office hours he will answer any questions you have but you have to ask expect him to know that you get something ask him tests are intense but he practically gives you the test in his reviews study them
5.0,M,hands down the best teacher at vscc infinitely knowledgable and just read from slides he physically teaches on a chalk board extra credit is available on tests as long as you really put effort into studying the material sometimes it feels like moving too slow but all because he cares about student comprehension
5.0,M,professor kent is hands down one of the best professors had my college career he gives a ton of extra credit and tells you exactly what he expects and what ask on his exams extremely knowledgeable and a great person in general a real gem he always comes to class with a smile and a hawaiian shirt on
5.0,M,kent is a great bio prof for a and p i recommend him i learned so much a lot of memorizing but he gives you study guides out of class help and extra credit on exams show up and pay attention and you should get at least a c or better
4.5,M,dr kent is flicking awesome most definitely not easy but easy and i am grateful to have had a professor that was so committed and knowledgeable since i have drawn greatly from what i learned in his class
3.5,M,dr kent is one of the best teachers i have ever had he is very thorough and passionate about his work he is very approachable likeable and generally a nice guy he gives tons of extra credit on his exams but his exams are tough he gives a study guide and will tell you what essay questions will be on the exam you can pass with an a
5.0,W,she is an amazing instructor who has much knowledge
3.0,M,an ok prof lectures are dry but mandatory as he has weekly quizes that count for percent of your total mark midterms no final and exams are all written and very easy no need to buy the textbook even though he says you have to read the powerpoints and come to quiz days and you will get an a
1.0,W,do not switched into her class and not only is she a hardcore feminist that only gives women a chance she is a really tough grader she also care about her students again unless a woman passionate about feminism do not take her she will have you rolling your eyes as she complains about male privilege
2.0,W,she is old-fashioned in her approach to teaching the subject matter she is definitely not a political scientist and is probably best suited for a different discipline altogether i found her courses to be poor preparation for graduate school
4.5,M,dr cherry is a great professor a discussion based classed with a relaxed atmosphere where people can share their ideas about the text you need to read in order to do well but he chooses good texts for the class he has a great sense of humor and is clear about what he expects you to accomplish in your papers i recommend taking his class
1.0,W,one of the worst professors ever had she tells you to follow the directions carefully but the directions could not be more unclear she initially introduced herself as the head of the computer and technology department at aacc but there is absolutely no way true if it is shame on you aacc she know anything about computers
1.0,W,terrible communicator she does not respond to emails and when she is short almost annoyed you even asked she does not do any grading at all the computer does all the grading and she does not check over to see even if that is correct we were given extra credit assignments and she did not even include them in the final grade terrible
1.0,W,one of the worst professors i ever had she does not respond to emails which is not good for a professor communication is a plus she is all into herself in class she does nothing but play on her little computer she is good at telling you what she want to do when she retire good at telling students not to ask her questions ask a group member
1.0,M,had some terrible teachers but he definitely made it to the top of the list i learned anything about the actual course but can tell you anything there is to know about his personal life and family do not take i repeat do not take unless you want to have a terrible semester
1.0,M,he teach the first times i was there i realized that he only talks about his life and it then the other times i was there was to find out when we will take the exam uh well we were very behind so he gave everyone a on the second exam dropping the lowest grade of the two easy a but you learn a thing just stay away
2.0,M,want a ancient professor whose lectures coherent and so boring they make you want to rip your eyes out then this hungarian psychologist called erdelyi is your guy you learn squat in his class he take attendance he gives midterms and a final other than that a really nice guy probably suffering from amnesia
1.0,M,i took him my first semester and all i remember is that he has an asian wife who he spoke of most of the time and joked that its good that he has tenure i gave him a for difficulty bc i was totally unprepared for the tests because he teach he even yelled at me once because i asked to many questions actually yelled bc i showed interest
1.0,M,do not take him he does not speak about psychology of personality he speaks mostly on statistics but what does stats have to do with this class he keeps on repeating what he says and stays on one chapter almost for a month his textbook does not make sense as well terrible professor
1.0,M,not even weeks into school and dropping this course this is the only time i have ever needed to drop a course mid semester he is an absolute idiot never stays on topic and repeats everything times over do not take him you will regret it he needs to be fired stat
1.0,M,harihar khanal is a nice guy and he knows math rather well however due to his accent it is hard to understand him very well and it is hard to learn from it he does not respond to emails very quickly and he loses some assignments if you turn them in outside of class he tries to have a sense of humor but its more dad jokes really
1.0,M,does not speak comprehensible english you will not understand him he calls n yen and s yes and says yes after every word so when you need s he says yes yes making it impossible to understand there are many other butcheries of the english language he thinks himself hilarious and will laugh at his own jokes and no one understands what said
5.0,M,one of the best things that happened in my life was having him as my professor i feel bad that the semester has came to an end he is brilliant
3.5,M,good teacher no hw or quizzes just exams exams were difficult but open book if you show up to lecture every day and ask questions it shouldnt be too hard also his grading rubric is very generous
3.0,M,overall an average professor gives good explanations requires a lot of textbook reading because his lectures are very vague tests are pretty tough but if you read the textbook you will pass
2.5,M,read this very carefully do not take this man do yourself a favor and take another psych class bc the only one that gives his lectures have excessive information and its hard to keep up in class beware of cumulative final its impossible to pass like i said do yourself a favor and do not take him im warning you your gpa dies
1.0,M,if you dont have the best memory and have issues professors who say thats the text book now go read it do not take him i have no doubt that he was once a good look at the amount journals he has published over the past decades and how his reviews have gotten worse over time long story short if you take him be ready to read for hours
4.5,M,his lectures are great he puts up detailed lecture notes on blackboard he does his best to help the students try to read the textbook read the summary section at least there are exams and a final all of which are multiple choices
5.0,M,aaron kozbelt knows his subject and he knows how to explain concepts he is organized his presentations are clear would have liked to have him for other courses some professors at brooklyn college should be watching him teach so they can brush up on their lecture skills
5.0,M,amazing angel of a professor dr kozbelt is an interesting professor his lectures are clear and concise and he is very understanding and reasonable even in a graduate level class take him
5.0,M,respected organized and professional he gives over hard concepts in a clear manner a focused setting
4.0,M,the class is hard you have to work for your grade but hands down the best stats professor at brooklyn college take him
3.0,M,an overall nice guy but this class is very stressful if you good at math you will struggle it was hard to follow along and there much tutoring hours my ta help much and from what i heard the other ones either if feeling lost and it seem any better drop the class he tried to help though
5.0,M,professor loparo is a really cool guy gives out extra credits when indians won and going to class before holidays the class material is hard but if you do the assigned homework you will be fine quizzes are easy as long as you do the homework final is kind of hard but he curves
5.0,M,extraordinarily smart and knows his material the department chair and rightfully so
2.0,M,try to be objective and critical something that this professor is not the most bs class ever taken his lectures are tangental without evidence and leaves you thinking that only of what he said is true his exam questions are his interpretations of the readings not the actual points any answer could be correct
5.0,M,lot of students wrote a negative review for saying that his lecture is dry but more like the topic is somewhat dry the professor definitely goes above and beyond the textbook and teaches useful programs that are currently used in the mis field really cares about his students hw is challenging and makes you think gives generous extra crdit
5.0,M,this professor is awesome if you show him that you care he will help you raise your grade make sure to do your homework and and go to his office before you submit a quiz and after you submit in exam this will guarantee you to get a higher grade you willl not regret taking this course with him the best
5.0,M,you will not regret taking a class with him i have always struggled with math and thought calc would be impossible for me but he made it understandable very funny cares about students and makes a lecture for a very boring subject interesting the textbook for this class is very complicated so expect to pass easily if you show
4.5,M,made class more enjoyable and made a rather complicated subject understandable has available office hours before class and is always willing to help he is also one of the goofiest and funniest professors had
5.0,M,professor strong is an awesome teacher he teaches the science and relates it all to real life if you stick with him he eases up towards the end of the semester he is knowledgeable and wise he is always willing to stay after class to help and even held a study group on a saturday morning before finals the best take him if you can
5.0,M,professor strong wants you to learn the material so he will make you work for your grade if you take your education seriously and expect to have your grade handed to you take this class this class taught me how to study for a test without memorizing general information truly one of my favorites
4.0,M,i was worried when i decided to take this teacher this is not an easy class the teacher is wonderful and takes time to explain the material if you hope to pass without studying this is not the class for you if you like to learn from somebody who knows i recommend this teacher he is absolutely one of the best you have to work very hard
4.0,M,prof strong is extremely energetic makes sure everyone is participating throughout labs and lectures if you put in the effort he will do the same skipping a class the best idea he does move quick but the book and powerpoint do help he makes all of his tests and makes every question critical thinking really tough
2.5,M,prof strong is an okay professor i found his lectures i basically taught myself by reading the chapters going over the ppts and creating my own study guides his tests are tough study everything if you ask for help he is willing to help though lab practicals are easy if you study and go to the tutoring center
4.0,M,he is a hard grader but he wants you to know the subject not just memorize it to pass the test if looking for an easy class this is not for you you will have to try really hard to make an a he does not curve give extra credit or make things easier for you
3.5,M,strong was one of my most favorite teachers about half of my class dropped but i feel it was due to laziness if you are not a lazy student and you put the time in you can guarantee an a or a b i had a month old baby a job and took this class i worked my butt off and made a b with a lot of help from mr strong he is an amazing teacher
2.0,M,run i mean you want to pass with a decent grade do not take him i have taken i have a massage license and i am dropping mid semester nearly my whole class is failing in which he takes no blame his tests are personally made and make sense compared to the lecture take someone else
1.0,W,the prof was missing in action the entire semester she seldom interacted with students maybe teaching is a low priority
1.0,M,highly would not recommend taking a class with this individual his grading for exams is non existent and his as a professor is severely lacking to say the least
3.0,M,professor cooke cares about the subject and the students but is extremely disorganized overall the lectures are interesting he is a harsh grader but curves the grades a lot the textbooks are completely unnecessary even though he made us buy four of them
4.0,W,i took mrs griffin during my first semester of college i know what i was getting myself into it was challenging she was very intimidating but she did help with giving good feedback on my papers we had to do like a mid-term timed writing and a page paper as final and a presentation of you presenting your thesis that you wrote about
2.0,W,i took this class online and regret it because eventually had to drop it you have to come into this class as a professional writer very stressful and makes you write a paper in a short time span not really clear on her instructions and expects you to already know do not take if english is not your best subject
5.0,W,i absolutely loved this class she had such a huge impact on me and sure she even realize it she is a wonderful teacher and she makes sure that the students make her do her job leave this class until you understand here because of and for you wonderful professor taken for i would take her again
5.0,W,i loved this class professor griffin was so fun and sassy it was not an easy class professor griffin believed in us and had high expectations i have fond memories of my semester with her
1.0,W,professor griffin is not helpful at all her organization skills are very poor we missed two weeks of class because of her personal issues and we had no sub during that time she does not explain anything right might come up with rude comments tries too hard to be funny very confusing tough grader recommend to take her classes
5.0,M,dr kuhlman is a great professor he is helpful willing to make time if you need assistance and is really clear on what he expects of you
5.0,M,he is a really great teacher and if you put effort into the class you will do well
4.0,M,dr winters is a great professor he will spend a significant amount of time helping you if you need it he is passionate about his work and puts in a lot of effort to push students to get out of their comfort zones and think about topics in a more abstract manner if you want to get an a in his class you have to be willing to work hard
2.5,W,make sure everything is turned in correctly you will not pass if you accadintally forget something i heard that she is great if you go and talk to her in person but she does not understand how to use technology in the least she will give zeroes if she feels need and even if she
3.5,W,dr asplin is really knowledgeable and is good at explaining tough material she is a great resource of information for psych students especially she can come across as very serious at times but also very laid-back and forthcoming about her expectations attend class regularly because she really helps you to get the material do the
4.0,W,not much homework all test are written response but she give awesome test reviews if you come to class you will pass
5.0,W,i highly recommend this professor she is intelligent and cares about her students very much i loved her class the most out of all of my political science courses so far be prepared to read everything though and to work for your grade the tests too bad if you read all of the material and keep up with your assignments
4.5,W,this was such a great class i learned a lot and it was really easy to pass as long as you showed up and you did the work she ask a lot of students there is a page paper so beware of that if you decide to take her class
2.5,M,chris is a thoughtful and conscientious professor not always exactly crystal clear with his instructions but if you have an higher than that of an earthworm you can usually figure out what talking about and if you have questions just ask him really approachable he expects a lot out of you and a good thing
5.0,M,great guy lets you turn in papers whenever it is convenient for you really cares about his students
5.0,M,dr rayson was by far the best professor i had in my time at normandale he is truly inspired me to do better in each assignment i handed in his tests are essays in which you will know about weeks in advance he allows revisions to these essays until you get the grade you want i highly recomend this instructor to anyone
5.0,M,i was not a history major but i took classes with david due to his ability to engage and inspire all of those in his presence his experience and wisdom are so profound that i always left each class feeling empowered and more compassionate the best of the best i highly recommend him to any student
5.0,M,take him an amazing teacher i got an a and did moderate work you also learn a lot from him like others said he is funny too and has a good personality
4.0,M,there are no tests in his class only papers but they are weekly he is very spontaneous and funny in class and some of the movies he shows are good attendance is very loose and extra credit is very easy to get and there are lots of opportunities for it also a very easy grader as long as you make all the points he wants to hear in papers
4.0,M,david was easily the best professor ever had hilarious and kind you can make up any assignment he ever assigns without penalty so wise i could listen to him talk for hours if you need a history credit and into history even if you are this is your guy take a class with rayson and you be disappointed
3.0,M,daily attendance grades posted so your grade is unknown till the end make sure you listen closely to lectures and take detailed notes quizzes a week he spends class time talking about different essay topics instead of essay writing but if you work hard and follow his instructions closely an a is attainable
2.0,M,he refused to put any grades in the grade book i had no other errors in my papers except him writing confusing next to seemingly random sentences in my paper somehow warranting me with a c grade on most papers english has always been my strongest subject and i usually ace papers not with this guy miss a peer editing day on that paper
1.0,M,this teacher has no type of personality his lectures are boring he is not clear about what the assignments are going to be about he is very unorganized he care for his students attendance is a must he is a horrible teacher the whole class received no higher than a c avoid this class
3.0,M,torn about this professor there was a distinct rudeness from him at times that was very degrading and stand-offish i want to maybe believe he is too intelligent to communicate with people of regular emotion at times he was understanding other times i felt his subtext was saying you are an idiot and i am more intelligent than you
1.0,M,this is the single worst teacher i have ever had in any of my years of schooling his criteria for grading is not well done but if you stray from what he wants you will lost points heavily extremely strict on grading and bother putting logic together about why you did what you did extremely lazy and very bad feedback on your errors
1.0,M,this is the only professor had that refuses to put grades in the gradebook i am paying a lot of money for his class so it is lazy of him to not simply do something nice for his students he is hard to talk to extremely boring and only does things that are convientent for him it almost seems as if he can care less about his students
1.0,M,rude like to take correction or be told he is wrong and unfair i do not recommend this instructor unless you are error free in everything you do
1.0,M,difficult teacher unless an advid writer do not take his will not help you even if you ask for can at times be when you try to ask something doesnt like being corrected even if you point a mistake out can tell he is not inspired to teach anymore dean refunded me right away without hesitation
1.0,M,very tough grader wants everything done his way i took this class online and unless you go to his office for every little thing you get a bad grade even if you email him the comments he gives for essays are subjective and demeaning would not recommend or take his class again took research writing classes at university they were easier
1.0,M,do not take this class he has no idea how to teach would talk about random things and is never helpful with the papers so hard to approach really care what your asking for unless you are a professional at writing take his class has stupid tests every class which are no help
5.0,M,great professor had him for and again for great in the big lectures but try and take a smaller class with him if you can the only professor at eastern who even bothered to learn my name really wants to hear what you have to say challenging but not unfairly so highly recommended
3.5,M,i love this professor taking him again in the summer totally knowledgeable in his field but he understands that students are not and that is why we are in class to begin with his tests are tough and need to devote some study time to any class with him but overall easy to learn from a wealth of information one of the best
4.5,M,loved this professor easy and right to the point if you needed anything he was always there
3.0,M,a great lecturer but he have an email and post notes online so be prepped to write your own good notes as he lectures fast also i be concerned about asking questions in class as he will ignore you he marks harder than my level profs give remarks on how to do better just calls undergrads stupid a lot
5.0,M,you get what you give bracken is not afraid to call students out on laziness and his honesty and high standards seem to unnerve undergrads however intelligent and well read and classes are funny and exciting he like email and office hours were near nonexistent but if gone to every class he will make time to talk to you
3.5,M,honestly such a sweet guy and genuinely cares about his students however his tests get more and more difficult as the semester goes on and he seems to be teaching less and less relevant material be prepared to do a lot of the learning on your own
4.5,M,dr bergeson is amazing his lectures are entertaining as well as helpful his tests are pretty tough though they can have tricky questions but mostly because not very many questions so if you miss a few you end up with a b or c on the test which ends up dropping your grade is an a
5.0,W,she is very patient never get mad or angry gives back fair marks very friendly
5.0,M,currently taking this class englander is an excellent professor the material is hard but if you pay attention its really not that bad tests are challenging but you can bring a page of notes and he is generous with points i definitely recommend taking a class with irv worked with computers since they were invented and he knows his stuff
2.0,W,i regret taking her class so many better professors at york in my opinion i really do think there are many more qualified professors at the institution than her to be also found her class really boring a decent person over all though
4.0,W,one of my hardest classes yet she grades tough but is pretty fair make sure you go to class for the in class problems as well as doing the take home problems she knows a lot about her field she ended up curving our overall grade even though she does not curve tests
5.0,W,this by far one of the most knowledgeable professors wmu has her class was tough and she makes you work for it but if you go to class and actually study the in class notes you wrote that is exactly what is on the exam btw you will pass and more importantly learn probably wont get an a though do no buy the book do not buy the book
1.0,W,this prof is completely useless i took this course online for only weeks and had to drop it after the first quiz her modules made so much sense however the questions on the quiz were worded so confusingly it was like she wanted everyone to fail horrible prof made an interesting useful course into something hideous and disgusting avoid
1.0,M,although a nice guy prof g is the worst professor had at pitt he teaches straight from the book and you learn any application which is basically what the tests are went to his office hours many times and find it to be helpful at all he knows what talking about but he sucks at teaching
4.5,M,good professor for this introductory class the lectures reinforce exactly in the book so attendance really mandatory but he ends early almost every day work through the chapters to answer the weekly true false quizzes and be fine
4.0,M,professor abert was a good professor he teaches a little fast in my opinion but he is very knowledgeable he takes attendance but does not give any in class quizzes of your grade is online loncapa and this alone will teach you everything you need to pass the class he does not give study guides for the tests but you can just review loncapa
4.0,M,great teacher going to his office hours is very helpful because he is willing to go over and workout any problem you ask him too lots of homework but it prepares you for the test pretty funny tests are based on the homework very fair grader skip class this class will not be an easy a study and do your work and you will get an a
2.0,M,he is a great teacher do not get me wrong but he is teaching format is for students who clearly grasp the concept of math i am terrible at math and i did terrible in this class do all homeworks attend all classes if you are good at math i advise you take this class because it may be easier for you
2.0,M,awful professor this was his first time teaching an mgf class and it clearly showed
5.0,M,he is a mathematics man awesome i had him for precal and will take him all of myh maths if i can
2.0,M,mr abert was not my favorite professor there were times that he would preform examples in lecture wrong and he could not correct them the lectures were unclear and hard to follow also the tests were very hard compared to examples we had done in class and after talking to classmates it was a communal feeling that we were not prepared for them
1.0,W,she is super strict if you do not complete something be ready to be kicked out of class she thinks her class is the only thing going on in our she assigns mass amounts of homework to be due immediately random pop quizzes are huge if you think you can come to class and review what you just read forget it you should know everything
1.5,W,she care about any excuses if you miss a book review or a test expect a she makes you read books in one semester
5.0,M,best math teacher ever had had to drop calculus twice before taking his class but got a b with him
3.0,M,tim is a really nice man and is very knowledgeable about his subject but as a teacher he is often inconsistent and frustrating a lot of reading and busy work
2.0,M,overall this class is pretty easy his syllabus has most of the words that will be on the quiz and final is optional he assigns two papers at most throughout the whole semester even try to email him he reply one thing i like was that you know what your grade is until the last few weeks no e-college
1.0,M,dr gallaher is an unfair grader he will not follow his grading key he will not return assignments from your first semester until your second semester so if you end up with a c you will have no idea why he also has made students feel stupid when they ask him question and has had to apologize it
2.5,M,if you can get to him on a good day he can be kind and helpful but on a bad day he is rather condescending and makes you feel like a complete idiot he makes really weird and boarding on inappropriate jokes his tests are really tough and there is never enough time for examples in class he is also a very slow grader when it comes to lab reports
1.0,M,his exams are way harder than his quizzes and the homework he assigns i got and on all his quizzes i went to tutoring a week and to peer study sessions once a week i went to him for help and was told that he expect much from his students and he understand why struggling i attended every lecture
5.0,W,i dreaded speech class and laura made it fun as long as you follow her grade sheet which is very clearly laid out on what she wants get an a you do need to know your speech a wonderful teacher i miss her class even though speech is my number one fear
4.0,M,me stettnar is a really good teacher his lectures are very understanding
5.0,M,he comes off weird at first but get used to it he knows his stuff and truly so nice he offers a lot of extra credit and chances to do them so he wants you to pass you can do bad on the exam and still pass the class with a b with all the extra credit opportunity he crams a lot of questions on the exams too
5.0,M,craig is an amazing teacher probably my favorite and i do not like science classes quirky and a little weird at first but you will love him by the end hilarious do not take bio if you do not like going outside because that is all you do if you do like going outside an easy a no homework except to read study for tests
4.5,M,craig stettner is awesome i did not want to take a science class at all but he definitely made it worth my while he offers so much extra credit over points i got on tests but still ended with an a in the class every lecture he gives you exercises which are nice grade boosters expect to go outside craig is really nice and helpful
3.0,M,he has us to a lot of speeches quizzes bought books but only used one is an okay grader would choose someone else
5.0,M,very approachable professor understands that public speaking can be nervous to many so he harsh when he gives criticism his grading is easy to understand overall practice your speeches ahead of time so that be in a good spot there are a few exams as well so you do have to read some chapters if you want to do well on those
5.0,M,he makes you feel at ease and his grading method is clear and precise he is also very approachable i highly recommend him if you have never taken speech and super nervous about it
5.0,M,really good professor he cares about his students and always wants them to improve he knows everyone fears of public speaking but he makes the class a friendly environment tests are easy never opened the purple book i used the white one to help me with our speech outlines very kind you have free absence passes if you go over you fail
5.0,M,he generously grades speeches even if they are bad and understands public speaking is hard he wants you to succeed and was my first professor in college to see good in me the tests are easy as long as you read the book learned so much in this class so if you take be sure to take him ask about extra credit i got points added
5.0,M,took spe at my home place almost passed but no luck had to repeat it at harper thought the course would be a joke wow i was wrong professor b is the dude to take prof b is dope he makes you learn how to speak publically and then you grow confidence and stuff lot of hands on in front of everyone be prepared you will learn a ton from him
5.0,M,mr b is a very good speech professor he understands most of his students hate public speaking but he just wants you to do your best some of his lectures are painfully boring but listening to someone talk about speaking tactics fun anywhere show up for your speeches on time and do fine
4.5,M,mr b is very enthusiastic about speech he loves what he does and it shows hes very easy to talk to and will give you feedback on his thoughts of your speech he creates a comfortable environment in his classroom so when you go up to speak it isnt scary you must show up to his class or you wont pass he keeps track of attendance
5.0,M,he was amazingggggggg
5.0,M,awesome professor his class are tough be expected to read and analyze the material because the questions on mid terms and final exams are not going to directly jump out at you unless you actually read read the material he is a honest person and he is understandable unlike some professors so just be honest with him and you will do fine
4.0,M,awesome professor i loved his approach to teaching we did have a surprise group project which was not on the syllabus but i liked that he graded on individual contributions because some people were just terrible he was great wit answering questions and clarifying topics and he participated in the forums along with the students take him
1.5,W,there was a major lack of communication with this professor she did not return emails and seemed very confused about grading i would not recommend her if you can find another professor for this class go with it she takes weeks to grade and is very last minute about it i paid for her class and yet was never able to communicate with her
5.0,W,brandie has the highest expectations of any prof had at byu she makes you earn every single point on tests papers and participation getting an a from her is a real challenge but the best prof had i learned so much from her and will take every class i can from her in the future if you really care about your edu take brandie
5.0,W,prof siegfried teaches her subject so well and in such depth you actually learn truths about life and not just forgettable test garbage she will invest in you prof siegfried has written me quality letters of recommendation first job law school app and after dont be afraid of getting a b and learning from the best english prof at byu

5.0,M,dr hardy was a great professor read many negative reviews about him but those must have been the students who were expecting hand outs and did not show for class dr hardy is fair you must comply when he tells you to show up for class and turn in assignments on time he helped with test prep and gave extra credit he was awesome say
2.0,M,he is an awful teacher cancelled class so many times in the semester with short notice without approving it through the department assigns essays which are very subjective and unclear grading recommend him
4.0,W,i absolutely love dr woolard a kind soul and she genuinely cares about her students and wants to help them succeed the class is not difficult though i did experience some technical difficulties with my computer which she was always willing to work through with me she believe in making a subject harder than it needs to be
5.0,W,my favorite art history professor super sweet is a practical professor she make you remember dates which is awesome if you know art history classes clear on her requirements and always accessible
5.0,W,professor von barghahn-calvetti or bvb as she prefers is easy to like because she clearly enjoys her work lectures are extremely well-researched if looking for an easy a with little work go elsewhere she expects a lot of research for papers presentations still she is always available for feedback is generous with grading
4.5,W,professor shelton was one of the best professors i have had she is always there for you when you need help during office hours after class and she is invested in success
1.0,M,literally so unclear grades papers harshly take his class going to regret your life if you take his class
1.0,M,weekly blog posts are long boring and graded very harshly he also does not give feedback would not recommend to other students
3.0,M,i said so many papers because the weekly blog posts have to be minimum words given a chance to make them up he uses an emoji grading system on the blog posts so i constantly had to look at the syllabus to see whether i got a or or whatever do the blog posts every week they are a huge part of your final grade real make or break
3.0,M,tough at grading but makes it clear that he wants you to write well-written blogs that look and prove that read the texts and have thought critically about them british so his humor is rather dry and sarcastic--i loved it very nice as long as you are respectful
2.5,W,dr spievak is a nice person but as a professor i would never take a class with her again cognitive psych was a nightmare she assigns long dry readings for every single class and you not have a quiz on every single reading or class period no powerpoints just speaks what you need to know very hard grader never satisfied
4.0,W,very professional and focused on her work keeps students best interests at heart and pushes them beyond their comfort zone in order to better then
5.0,W,dr spievak is an outstanding instructor she is an expert in her field as long as you put in the work and dedication she will ensure that you do great she genuinely cares and your work in her class can without a doubt take you far beyond the class itself she prepares you for grad school do not take if you willing to work for it
2.5,W,i will never take her ever again you guys say no text book is a plus but with cognitive psychology you neeeed a textbook and also the fact that she do actual power points with notes she expects u to read a bunch of articles but heaven help you if you miss one day of reading i will say she tries to make it fun as possible
3.0,W,the reviews about this professor below regarding what type of course work is expected during this class are accurate however if you want to work with somebody that wishes to challenge you into becoming a better student i suggest this professor tough but she cares and if you put in the necessary effort and work hard you will see that
5.0,M,i hated math until i took dr calc i class then i took his calc ii and he convinced me to be a math major extremely grateful to dr neal for making me feel so confident in myself very caring and notices when something is wrong with a student
1.0,M,worst prof terrible sexist prof makes jokes or comments and then spends mins explaining he mean it to be sexiest or racist lectures suck all he talks about is his life and things from toronto has biased opinions that he will share tests are complete bs puts stuff on there never discussed you have to read every word in text
5.0,M,he is the best person ever he is a genius totally energetic and all over the place and totally devoted to teaching also one of the funniest people on campus and definitely has the biggest personality on campus i love him and have taken two classes with him and because of him going to be a religion major learned so much from him
5.0,M,ron cameron is the most amazing professor ever had he is an incredible lecturer and he is one of the leading experts in his field he runs around the room acts things out you can tell extremely passionate about what teaching also hilarious be sure to take a class with hime while at wesleyan
3.5,M,he is one of the smartest proffesors on campus because of the fact he has taught this class for around decades his grading however is ridiculous and i assure you that you will get no higher than a b do not make the mistake i did by taking this class gpa killer
1.0,M,horrible teacher he seems passionate but it is about nothing hard to understand i stand one and a half hours in a class with him worst lecturer ever had he outright said christianity and every faith is beautiful but wrong so derogatory
4.5,M,best teacher had a wesleyan his enthusiasm for the subject was infectious i went into the class thinking i was going to drop it because the first reading seemed dense but he manages it to make it interesting and enjoyable as long as you do the reading and take advantage of office hours when something is unclear be fine
3.0,W,dr hall is a genuinely nice professor she will let you make up quizzes and homework with some leniency homework and quizzes are assigned bi-monthly without the use of a syllabus calendar rachel will say at any rate about times per class very hard to wake up for this class if its at
2.5,M,he gives a lot of papers and is vague on the material for the midterm and final he gives you six essay topics to memorize but only two are on the test extremely stressful
1.0,W,i tried going to her office for help she asked me questions then i tried to answer them but got them wrong she then said i needed to get help um what i was there for she has a difficult language barrier no matter how much i did i could not pass who grades homework anymore that did nothing but have my grade go lower and lower
2.5,W,the first half of the semester is on book material and the second half is doing a confusing as hell group project it did not help that she missed so many days of class the tests are somewhat difficult but if you read the book you should be good to go make sure to ask her questions outside of class because her instructions are often vague
1.5,W,the course was pointless provided no insight into simulation due to her teaching style and like all of her classes she taught it like a management class and you learn nothing about the subject because she know anything about it this is the only class that directly involves simulation in the bgs major and it added nothing to my knowledge
1.5,W,you essentially need to have your book and constantly read it in order to understand what is going on she lecture but has you become the teacher in the course and teach everyone else difficult to understand what is happening because she constantly switches between talking about the class and hypothetical scenarios without warning
1.0,W,her lectures were incredibly specific and too advanced for an introductory class she would wonder why no one was understand anything and the concepts were uninteresting in the way she presented them she seem to care about the intro class at all is only in it for her own research
2.0,W,she is an incredibly smart person but a terrible professor i had her for an introductory class but she acted as if we were supposed to already know everything she spent at least half the class rambling about nothing important and then wondered why nobody understood anything
3.0,W,she will make you print out almost every reading for class will have at least three readings every night of at least pages outrageous amount of work
2.5,W,if you are a design major like i was i do not recommend taking her her class is way too demanding she assumed her class was most important when it even relevant to my major expect to read every night and have a lot of homework she assigns a long paper that is split into smaller ones but still makes it difficult for you
1.0,W,if you have a full time job and are taking three classes do not take her class the only people who have time for hrs of studying per night are running start students who have no bills or other classes she barely responds to emails you will not know your grade until the report after the final do not take this class
3.0,W,i love christina a lot her classes can be demanding if you miss or skip in for a world of hurt everyday is new subject material just do your reading and do your homework be prepared and you can learn a lot her clarity was sometimes an issue i was always asking other students what did she say
1.0,W,this is the worst class ever take new language is hard to start most of students had learned spanish in high school but not she help me at all i rather spend time with tutor than spending any miserable second in her class never recommend this class if this is the first time you start learning spanish
5.0,M,grades on a point grading scale he is so nice and always energetic and ready to teach i would recommend him to anyone
4.0,M,i learned a lot from him
4.0,M,i absolutely love dr milner he is very passionate about teaching and learning class generally meets once a week with discussions and online tests and there is nothing too difficult if you want to be inspired take this class
3.5,M,easy class scattered professor but effective miss a few weeks you will suffer in the class miss once you are ok quizzez fill in the blank tests are covered in the class so you know exactly what he wants to see just show up take decent notes its a pretty easy a
4.0,M,professor karras is stern and speaks in a monotone manner he show much of his personality a reserved fair guy pick your karate partner wisely because be stuck with them all semester my partner had a nice body so you know i was chillin d no flying kicks in this class mostly defensive grappling maneuvers
4.0,M,theirs a written midterm which he basically tell you all the answers to the class before and a final for the final you have to perform all the moves you learned through the semester i thought i was going fail because i could never remember any of the moves from the class before but he let us record him doing the moves i ended up getting an a
1.0,M,do not take this class worst class i have ever taken first off the class is located in the colleges wrestling room which smells absolutely terrible and the mats are infected with a skin fungus known as ring worm he makes you stand infront of class and perfom kerate moves embarrasing he can be very irrational and rude stay away
1.0,M,very rude if he doesnt like you better off not asking anything good luck with this stand up guy lol
5.0,M,i was very hesitant to take this class but honestly prof karras is the best he really knows his stuff and is willing to help anyone who asks for it there is a midterm and a practical final but every technique is clearly reviewed and gone over multiple times throughout the semester take karate with this prof have fun and regret it
4.5,M,he was intimidating at first but as time unraveled he turned out to be a cool guy when he explains his demos he is very deliberate and clear he is also willing to go over something you missed my favorite thing about him was that over the course he would give little life speeches about maintain awareness very nice man and i overall learned a lot
5.0,W,love love love dr wall as a teacher i have had her for several classes in my graduate program she is very well organized with class content there is no way to mess anything up or not to understand what is expected i love that she uses schoology for the class setup it is a million times better than wish i had her for undergrad classes
5.0,M,welcoming and informative plays music before class sometimes class consisted of lectures and a weekly quiz lectures were enjoyable and engaging quizzes were easy if you read the blog posts and documents overall one of the best professors especially at mount holyoke would recommend taking his class even if not majoring in politics
5.0,M,take this class without a doubt the most inspirational professor i have ever had he was one of the reasons i chose to come to this college you be disapointed
5.0,W,get on her good side she is full of connections
5.0,W,tina laplaca is very great at what she does she juggles a lot being both a professor and an advisor she gives great advice and wants you to succeed in life her lectures are fun and informational because she shares both her knowledge and personal experiences she is highly recommended you wont be disappointed
4.5,W,i love professor laplaca like a mother to her students extremely pleasant and genuinely wants you to succeed the problem is that she gives you an extremely long time to finish each project which how the real world is also seen people with bad projects still manage to get because a very easy grader
4.0,W,sassiest professor ever had no drinks or food other than water but over all her class was pretty easy if you show up do her daily reflections and follow her syllabus to the dot lot of papers to keep up with i ended up dividing mine by week in a binder
2.0,W,she is one of the rudest professors i have ever taken she will not let you eat or drink in class unless from a water bottle no sodas or coffee she goes over activities in class but her tests are nothing like what she goes over she will call you out if caught on your phone or talking while she is talking beware of her
3.0,W,easy if you pay attention she teaches based on application not content expect things you know to be on the test she grades easy but it is the tests that will get you make a study group quizlet helps immensely with this class sweet lady but not the nicest of people and will treat class as if it is an elementary school classroom
5.0,M,have had him for several classes study the power point and you will get an a but know it inside and out he is a wonderful caring professor who will go out of his way to explain things sometimes he seems a little annoyed if you ask too many questions but he always is willing to answer them you get out of class early
4.0,M,prof harding is funny and personable he grades a little tough but gives you the rubric before hand so you know what going to be graded on he put almost any grades in bb until the very end of the semester so hard to know how doing in the class he is a fun professor and tries to make things interesting
4.5,M,harding is definitely one of the better english profs on campus he is extremely intelligent and his english accent bad to listen to either he really appreciates when his students go to him for help and participate in class went to his office hours once for help on a presentation and he guided me through the whole thing go to class
5.0,M,jim is one if the greatest professors i have ever met a true mensch he cares deeply about theatre so much so that even if you have a limited knowledge of theatre he engages you to constantly do more to grow your knowledge is fed by the true genius of the mans knowledge he invites the best of the best to come in to do workshops take his classes
4.0,W,weird but in a good way read a lot in her capstone but a very inviting and pleasant atmosphere a professor that really truly engages with what she reads and works hard to make sure everyone is just as excited about the novels some work but one of the most memorable classes taken here
4.0,M,dr allard is very funny and very engaging even as a hard marker he cares about his students and is very helpful everything you would want in a professor is in dr allard he is not only good at teaching but also good at communicating what he wants from students his marking is difficult but very challenging and helps students learn and grow
4.0,M,i thought that professor allard was awesome he is an excellent speaker which made lectures interesting and engaging this was my first english class in university and he made sure that the students understood clearly what was expected of them and was very approachable if you had any questions i am always looking for more of his classes to take
3.0,M,professor class was my college course taken in years his technique annoyed me at first but once i got the hang of his style he so bad read the book follow the syllabus and come to class and you will be fine his stories are quite literally
1.0,M,this professor rambles for hours about stuff marginally related to the chapter at best self-centered and conceited he believes no one is smarter than he really teach tells you first day to get an a read the book but also to not trust the book would not recommend overall
5.0,M,this professor will teach you more than any other professor at ccc he lectures for the entire class but always interesting if you have an open mind and enjoy critical thinking this is the guy for you he will willing to help and clarify anything if needed
4.0,W,she might seem intimating but only because she cares about her students she is very knowledgeable about the subject and answers any questions you ask her her lectures are long but always interesting pass the class as long as you do your reading take notes and do the projects
5.0,W,she is the most organized professor ever had and the class was fun looking forward to it at all but it was great no pushover but as long as you come to class and do the assigned work be fine
5.0,M,best art teacher hands down i learned so much from his classes and improved dramatically under his wing he definitely cares about his students and will go the extra mile for students
5.0,M,jim is by far the best art instructor had at elac his dedication and level of expertise are unparalleled learned so much from him without hesitation i enthusiastically recommend him to anyone
1.0,M,easiest class ever taken if you know how to do the bare minimum in microsoft office you can get an a bother showing up on time because he sure as hell he makes you print out your assignments so be prepared to spend money on the print service old and confuses himself a lot so be prepared to teach yourself
3.5,M,you definitely need the book because of the online code only tests during the term easy homework and assignments if you have essential knowledge in microsoft office you have problems getting a good grade sometimes is not clear explaining in class but not a bad teacher pd if you ask him many questions he might get mad sometimes lol
2.0,M,the lectures were actually pointless for this class make sure you read the textbook i learned all the stats i know from the textbook not him
1.0,M,we use datadesk a program he invented years ago instead of something more modern his ego is so big we use a real stat program since it was made by someone else makes it very difficult to get help cause no one knows how to use his program
1.0,M,he loves the sound of his own voice take another professor if you really wanna learn stats
2.0,M,promises to be your statistician for life but ends up talking down to students and using the class to inflate his own ego excessive number of ambiguous problems from an overpriced textbook he wrote himself take another professor for this required class if you can
1.0,M,never heard of having to do papers in a math class but we have almost weekly papers on concepts he even taught yet
1.0,M,i was amazed that someone could have such a large ego he acts like too good for an intro to stats course but i think he only teaches it since he gets to sell his textbook to all his students a lousy textbook with many typos and every student pays that goes right to his pocket
4.5,M,very clear lecturer excited about statistics does have an ego but you interact with him much anyway if you study and practice with the questions at the end of the chapters do well on the exams put in the work and learn stats i understand the subject so much better now take this class you regret it
2.5,M,fine at best he is disgustingly arrogant however if you can get past his ego he is more concerned that you understand statistics overall opposed to just the math behind it which is good some days he can be very boring tests are fair and papers yes papers quite a few of them are not terrible at all overall not terrible but not enjoyable
5.0,M,i had not taken algebra for over a decade when i signed up to take college algebra with mr ream he truly wants students to succeed and as long as you do the assigned homework and reach out to him if you are struggling he is more than happy to do whatever he can to help he tries to make math fun and gives curves on the exams highly recommend
5.0,M,i am very fond of mr ream never done well with maths but i did very well in his class he is patient and makes sure you understand the concept he allows you to make up for partial credit he is old school but that is partly why i enjoyed his class so much-easier undrstd he is friendly and very sharp i would take him again
2.0,M,professor ream was a sweet old man and tries really hard to teach well but a struggle his lectures are wildly confusing and he goes off on tangents and abandons problems without actually showing us the answer he gives a ton of extra credit and curves everything so this class awful if math is a tough subject for you stay away
4.5,W,she s a good teacher that makes sure her students understand very well her explications are clear highly recommend to do previous midterms and finals which is really helpful
4.5,W,really good teacher always tries her best to help and takes all her time to do so unlike several other teachers she explains elaborately and her notes are so beneficial would take another class with her if i can thank you ewa duma
4.0,W,i really enjoyed her class i undertood her teaching style she was clear in her directoins and she helped me become a better writer overall she does asign a lot of papers but she grades quite easy in my opinion i would take her again
2.0,W,she is not a good professor class would be so pointless showing up very late at submitting grades she is super nice and funny and class is very chill but as a professor she is horrible her grading is not clear she changes things last minute and before you know it class is cancelled take her if you have to
1.0,W,worst professor ever this class was credits but been she gives too much homework makes you do a group project where you interview other professors students she gives too many long papers for this one project some papers not even related to our project she is the only teacher that waits until the last day to submit grades
1.0,W,very disorganized and unprepared she never passes back your assignments to show you your grades and she post midterm grades so you basically need to guess how well doing the whole semester she made everyone come to class the day before thanksgiving break just to tell everyone minutes into class that she will cancel it
1.0,W,absolutely horrible professor terrible temperament and very unclear about assignments she makes everything as complicated as possible seemingly in attempts to trip up students very unwilling to help students when confused and simply has no consideration for anyone other than attractive male students in the class avoid her at all costs
3.0,W,professor sheryl gifford is an average instructor she provides you with positive feedback and truly does care about how you end the semester yet she is not the most organized she is constantly pushing back dates when she is supposed to hand back final drafts and does not post grades on blackboard so you basically have to calculate your grade
2.5,W,a very tough grader she wants essays done very specifically to the style of her liking and not very clear about exactly what she wants she is somewhat helpful
2.5,W,she has a very specific way she wants you to write your essays especially for i would not say she is very clear most of the time she confused me because she would condradict everything she said this made it hard for me to write my essays
4.0,W,shes a very nice lady who likes to crack some semi-funny jokes she is not a tough grader and is always willing to help especially if you go to office hours class just consists of peer reviews which is fairly simple
4.0,W,take advantage of the peer reviews she helps comes up with ideas for the topics papers are only pages long but they make you think
5.0,W,i have taken three classes from professor murphy-lee at uw-milwaukee and absolutely love her as long as you attend class and do the readings this class will be easy peasy she literally goes over word for word the answers you will need to write your papers and take your exams she will help you endlessly so long as you ask definitely recommend
5.0,W,she is at uwm i have taken her non language classes attendance is important in her class tho with a valid reason you can miss some you will have an assinment every week a quiz in some classes every week and papers and exams its not an easy a but if you do the work participate you should get an a an awesome teacher
5.0,W,i took this class at the university of wisconsin milwaukee with her a class about vampires and it is really interesting but take it if you just want an easy course that involve much if you like to read and write than it will be super easy be sure to show up to class though
5.0,W,i had her for asl and i wish i could have her for my teacher for every class she always gives good feedback she also tells stories along with vocab to make it easy to learn she also taught us how to still use signs even if we do not know the exact sign by description best teacher i have ever had from kindergarten to now she really cares
5.0,W,she uses real life situations to go along with lessons there is homework every week but like the rest of the class participation shows in your grade attendance is graded try to just write random stuff for homework or it will show in your test scores i would recommend her i will take her class every chance i get
4.5,W,i thought yasmin was a great prof the first day she specifically tells you the class will be boring but it she makes it interesting and has a good sense of humor there were exams total with no final and some compositions but they were all pretty easy and straightforward if you go to class and pay attention you should get an a
5.0,W,prof topping is a great instructor who cares about her students and wants them to succeed show up do the work show interest in the subject and get an a no problem
5.0,W,topp truly cares about her students and definitely has a passion for what she teaches i would recommend her class to everyone
5.0,W,top was absolutely amazing i would take all of her classes if i had the time and money she makes college fun and i love her to death
5.0,W,awesome professor really easy class just take notes and listen definitely would take her again if possible
5.0,W,professor topping top is so hilarious kind and knows her stuff you wont find yourself with any questions that she cant answer about psychology her class will be entertaining and before you realize it the semester has flown by and you have learned so much more than you probably expected
5.0,W,awesome sad day leaving her class for the last time hilarious keeps you interested and really wants for every student to pass no way anyone should fail her class
3.0,M,his lectures can be boring at time all he does is lecture the entire time and the tests are essays based on mostly the text some on lecture however he is super approachable and willing to help as long as you ask he has been the most helpful professor had so far he wants all his students to succeed you just need to reach out to him
2.5,M,midterm and final make up almost all of your grade tests are essay questions he gives you the class before the test he gives you questions but only two are on the test and you write about one the questions are confusingly worded and have multiple separate parts personally do not recommend
1.0,M,he is probably one of the most picky professors i have ever met his grading is very inconsistent for one speech i used a visual aid in a way he liked for the next speech i did it in the same way and for some reason he did not like it and gave me a lower grade also tell you something is ok but then later you it is not
1.0,M,he has set ideas politically and if your speech happens to conflict with his beliefs your grade will reflect it even if your research is extensive discredit it because he agree with your point i feel like people who side with him politically love him because he grades to encourage his beliefs so much for open
4.5,M,great teacher very enthusiastic and genuinely cares about his students great guy one of my favorite teachers had
5.0,M,i absolutely love this man his theater background makes his history lectures extremely entertaining and you will have several good laughs he require you buy a textbook which is fantastic and you get points taken away you only add on only downside is he use canvas take this class you will learn so much
5.0,M,professor damen has a different way of grading you earn points by doing assignments and taking tests rather than losing them if you get a bad grade this makes it possible to get a good grade even if you do well on tests he has a lot of guidelines for his papers i really enjoyed his lectures if you put forth the effort you can get an a
5.0,M,karpinski is definitely a real gem he gives you extra time to turn in papers he is a fair grader he has amazing lectures he is more interested about you knowing the material than passing so you most definitely will pass if you just show little effort in the class i love this man graduating if not take him again one of the best
3.0,M,i recommend that you read the course description because the title of the course is misleading the books for the class are necessary every assignment is based on the readings he can come off as a little rude to the skeptics however he really tries hard to be respectful be prepared to hear rambling from the die hard christians in the class
5.0,M,dr karpinski made it clear during his first interaction with the class that he was there for the students although it was an easy class he made sure that the students got the most out of each and every class through participation great reading material and discussion
5.0,M,highly recommend taking his class at depaul encourages participation and makes everyone feel included
5.0,M,dr k was awesome he always kept my interest and made a thursday night class tolerable which is really impressive
3.0,M,his class hard just really easy to get bored as long as you know your terms and definitions be fine he like making things too difficult so the bare minimum is how his classes are set up
2.5,M,this class is just hard period physics is not my forte mr dipert can come off as condescending and confusing but found if you approach him outside of class he is a different person he tells you what to expect on quizzes and exams and leaves plenty of room to ask for help if you do well on final and project pass
1.5,M,never ever have i met a more condescending and rude teacher in my life if you have thick skin you can pretty much expect to leave in tears after every class claims he wants you to succeed but then tells students they make a good such and such if they do do that word cannot describe how awful he talks to students
5.0,M,this class was way easier than i thought he lays out clear guidelines for what you need to do to pass and you decide how you will do every week he has a quiz which you must be present for to be able to get your points that build up to an a but as long as your getting a decent grade you can leave early he is very willing to help
1.0,W,ask a question and spend five minutes giving you a non-answer definitely got a second-waver feminism vibe from her
5.0,W,very thorough tests go over what we learn in class and she purposefully make them difficult i feel like she cares about us passing and wants us to succeed we have a few take home tests which help to raise our grade gives extra credit and us drop our lowest grade meaning we can skip the final if doing good enough
3.5,W,she is very straight and to the point it is helpful to highlight in the book during lecture most of what she says and puts on the test comes straight from the it highlighting makes it a lot easier to study for her tests use that as your study guide she does not take attendance but her lectures are definetly helpful for the tests
4.5,M,hunter henson is seriously one of the most intelligent professors ever had and even ever known as a person it took some time to figure this out because he is super super humble he is about yrs but has been teaching ems for yrs he is a truly good person has strong moral compass is an rn in spare time expect breaks
5.0,M,what a guy abbas is a german genius mathematician with a slick accent always cracking little jokes bringing a little light to a very dull and stale topic the class is stone cold but not gonna change with a different prof plus lectures mandatory because he posts his notes online go to recitation for the quizzes
4.0,M,i love abbas with all my heart having him as a prof is like having a genius grandpa teach you math super approachable clearly cares for students explains ideas offer alternative explanations writes down everything he says and posts online this can be annoying in class but makes it easy to miss class but skip super funny
4.5,M,not an easy class but he definitely helps the homework problems are very similar to those on the quizzes and tests
1.0,M,i have always been a good math student so good it is my major however conrad is a terrible teacher he is hard to follow and is corrected by his students at least once a day might as well take it online because you will be teaching yourself i will probably retake because his test are of your grade and his grading makes no sense
2.5,M,he teaches directly from the book and is very boring makes many mistakes on the board and has to be corrected by students tests of grade and homework of grade very difficult if you are not naturally good at math
4.0,M,class is very difficult because calculus he do a great job at explaining the material during class but if go to his office and ask for help explain it much better you have to show up to his class if you know calculus by heart let him intimidate you during the first couple of weeks either he is a nice man
5.0,W,mrs johnson is a wonderful teacher one of the best i have ever had she genuinely cares about the success of her students and wants them to do good she is more than willing to help when a student needs extra help she tries to teach each lesson several different ways because everyone learns differently highly recommend this teacher
1.0,W,at first she seemed very enthusiastic about teaching the class after a while she seemed to get confused and second guessed herself and very helpful a lot of the time outside of class she was pretty responsive other than going over homework questions and being redundant with lectures i felt as if no one was really learning anything
3.0,W,i had prof fenton for algebra she lectures over everything you need to know but moves very quickly and if you slow her down she will make you feel dumb for asking a question if you pay attention show up for class and do the homework its an easy a
5.0,W,i had professor fenton for college algebra she made all the concepts very clear and worked through problems in a very thorough manner she always makes time for questions and will work with anyone who is having trouble with the material
3.0,W,interesting like everyone else said make you feel dumb if you slow her down with questions but she is still willing to help very understanding if respectful but i exactly recommend her if you are semi good at math and pay attention for the most part you should be okay though
3.0,W,i recommend this class if you know you are not great at math she moves really fast if you slow her down by asking a question make you feel stupid
5.0,M,he was a very tough grader but graded very fairly to what you actually knew i used the textbook quite a lot also to answer his questions he has certain papers to write that you need the textbook for or else you might not get a good grade but overall he was a great professor and i am very glad i took him for psychology
5.0,M,he is very specific on how assignments are completed make sure you complete initial discussion posts deadline retake exam tests-he gives unlimited attempts you must be detailed and give essay answers in your own words class is not hard but requires lots of grading if you follow directions and he offered
1.0,M,refused to grade my assignments citing book page number not shown when i even have the book it was listed on the class website that i would receive credit if i used and cited the class page sources which i did when i complained to him about this he gave me next to nothing points for the assignments then a few weeks out from the end of the semester he told me there was no way i could re-do my assignments and that i would need to make perfect scores on all assignments and quizzes and tests from then until the end of the semester if i wanted to pass even having the gall to suggest re-taking the class during the summer horrible teacher do not take his class if i could give a rating lower than one star i would
2.5,M,literally win teacher essay them included pg s either i really suck at essay questions or he just hates me but i got out of points my heart sank research activity-combined part with because they were the same he give me the points for because according to him i complete it boo
4.0,M,loved this class i took it in high school and often find myself comparing him to professors i have now he is so funny and lectures were interesting we even took a field trip to a prison very helpful and knows how to entertain students
4.0,W,i liked the way she taught we got written and oral credit it was a lot of worl but it was all well worth it
4.0,W,good class liked the paper of my work even though it is not criminal justice take her
3.0,W,she is a so so teacher she truly cares about the students be prepared to learn the majority of the content on your own i got an a in this class she is a very easy grader the people who said she was a tough grader and gave hard exams are the ones who did not prepare this is a tough subject you need to study
1.0,W,bar-none the worst professor had throughout different institutions only take her class if you are already an expert on programming lectures are vague and unhelpful no study guides but very difficult nasty attitude broken english grades ruthlessly lots of homework w material not covered in class
4.0,W,she will give many extra credits i think her logic and lecture is clear if focus on what she said and no tired of questions we have to be really careful with homework because of so many details i learn preciseness and patience from her
4.0,M,i dont understand why he is useless david martin has specific teaching experience there are times the class is tough to understand but he makes you work for it giving you quizzes every week in class a big deal it wakes you up he gives lab homework and his grades assignments hes not like other teachers that dont grade hw
1.0,M,i just feel like he just made his course difficult on purpose on the first day he told us that more than of his students fail so i know if its his fault or the students he gives out quizzes everyday which is fine but what he teaches in class is completely irrelevant to what he gives out just as stated in the comments below
3.0,M,he is a nice guy but his teaching style is really hard to understand
2.0,M,his class was okay i would recommend lots of studying outside of class because his voice is little monotone so makes you sleepy in class
1.0,M,worst cis teacher ever seriously he needs to retire or something he seems like a pretty decent guy but what he teaches is completely irrelevant to what he gives out in his exams trust me just take another teacher and get a better grade
5.0,W,cis in general is a pretty boring you basically learning the fundamentals of programming so look for this class to be extremely fun just study hard learn these fundamentals and look forward to taking cis trust me make sure you take professor kendall martin for her teaching style is inspiring and you work on cool stuff
4.0,M,he definitely prepares you for make sure you read the book ahead of or after he lectures on this topic the book definitely explain concepts alot better reason why i feel he prepared me was because he tests you on every detail explained in the book which is needed in understanding java so you can program fun stuff in
5.0,M,hilarious guy must take this is a gpa booster i had him as an online class and i was cracking up while reading the study guide take him
5.0,M,hilarious man i enjoyed attending his classes i highly recommend him for non-bio majors
5.0,M,professor warwick is the best i took his online course plus the lab and i actually learned a lot he explains bio in a way in his lab book that normal people can comprehend i highly recommend him if you stay up to task you will get an a he is very understanding and you can email him with best prof ever
5.0,M,i took his class a few years ago and i really liked him he seems like a genuinely nice person and he has a really funny sense of humor i recommend his class
5.0,M,of our grade participation was given by attending class was awarded for doing in-class readings and small projects in which he would rarely assign quizzes are easy online and of our grade midterm and final are of the grade are also online tests you take at home if you get an a in this class sad lol
5.0,M,professor warwick is amazing he is funny and super understanding one time i got an answer wrong on a quiz and i gave him an explanation as to why i chose that specific answer and he liked my explanation and said that he would add that point back on he is eager to help and i highly recommend taking his class wish i could take his class again
4.0,M,i took both biology and the lab you cannot use used lab manual kit you have to buy new each semester because he uses different colored lab sheets labs are easy be careful if you search google for answers because some are wrong rent textbook instead to save money very easy class overall but it help you if you are science major
4.5,M,dr kurtz is a transformational educator very rarely do students have an opportunity to learn from a teacher such as him he does not parent you but he expects a mature student to be prepared and engaged each day he is wicked smart he is hilarious in his own awkward offbeat way he cares a lot about what he does and it shows simply great
4.5,M,a hard grader i got a b yet one of the best professors i have ever studied with at denison expect to read a lot but the workload is still manageable his lectures were really good and enjoyable provided you read the textbooks
1.0,W,this professor teach how to use materials i recommend watching youtube videos to master materials because one will not learn technique from the professor she gives a lot of pointless lectures too class time is not used well and can be boring she is very spacy but has a kind and enjoyable personality a good ta saves the day
3.5,W,she a bad professor but definitely give a lot of work
5.0,M,great nice lectures alongside films related to the class take home midterm and final with some hw assignments inbetween he make your semester a living hell and learn a lot from his lectures and just speaking to him in general
4.5,M,hot professor went to yale and he is a lawyer would definitely take and yes even if he talks that kean is the worst it is true
5.0,M,mr filson is a very kind and understanding professor it is not the easiest class but if you work hard to understand what he is saying you will get a good grade before the tests he gives answers to the study guide which really helps understand what will be on the test i would love to take another one of his classes and highly recommend him
5.0,M,great teacher and advise taking him he really helps out and the exams are a piece of cake if you study for them
5.0,M,love him
4.5,M,great lectures very clear and consist however go see the tas if you have a question unless you are absolutely stuck if you ask him a question because confused get ready for a verbal thrashing
1.0,M,prakash is honestly very overrated loves to intimidate students and is extremely cocky and arrogant i went to him for help and all he did was spit in my face about how i need to pay more attention in class i obviously went to him because i understand his notes but he understand how anyone could not understand his amazing notes
4.0,M,the online class is great his test is basically directly off of his powerpoints it is worth taking his class he is easy and a down to earth teacher which makes easier to digest than others but is naturally a lot of material by itself i am in the nursing program just make sure your nursing program will accept an online class
5.0,M,i thoroughly enjoyed professor biol class at the highland crest campus i will be taking him for biol this upcoming semester he tells you exactly what he expects you to know on each test there are no guessing games test questions come right from his power points
4.0,M,dr mann is an awesome teacher he knows the material inside and out you know exactly what he expects on exams and where your grade stands at any point in the semester he uses schematics to explain main points and online lectures give you a chance to review for exams he is very helpful and an all around good person
2.0,M,hate this professor a student who loves all my professors thought i loved him too very tough especially with his grading took off points because i had a comma in the wrong spot help if you go to him he told me good luck other students have told me the same he use technology read anything he writes
5.0,M,i enjoyed the way he lectured but you really have to work for your grade in this class i recommend you to print the notes out and just fill in the blanks there was a weekly online hw and quiz but they were usually pretty easy just as long as you put some effort into studying for the exam do fine
4.0,M,if you just go to the lecture take very good notes and do the study guide you will pass his lectures are clear and understandable he gives current examples to allow the student to understand the topic at hand homework quizzes and in class work are given tests are mainly multiple choice but problem sets are also included
5.0,W,she is very kind although hard to understand has a great grading scale and gave extra credit very often in lectures will stay after and help you comprehend
4.0,M,great at relating all topics in class and is interesting in his lectures read the textbook for tests though
4.0,W,ms lester helped me test out of learning support classes through the summer bridge program a very nice lady and a very clear teacher she can come off as rude or condescending but honestly i think she means too
5.0,M,dr lombrana is the best he really cares about his students and wants them to do well if you are lazy or show up to class you will not pass this class you will need to study his powerpoints a lot but he does a great job explaining things to help you understand i will be taking him for as many biology classes as i can
5.0,W,she has a hunger to teach everyone well she deeply cares about education and wants to make sure everyone learns the material she teaches great she gives plenty of time to complete assignments she also works with you to help you get a better grade if needed manageable workload easy grading one of my favorite teachers yet
5.0,W,i loved her im defintley taking her again shes incredibly sweet and has really good advice and will help you with anything you need coming into csm from another school was hard so i felt so relieved when she helped answer many of my questions fair amount of essays but topics are fun and relatable research but she walks you through it
2.0,W,very nice and understanding but the only form of teaching is by talking and rambling for an hour says obviously at the end of every other sentence when nothing is actually obvious goes off topic a lot but does get material in she is very open to helping you with your work
1.0,W,if you want to waste an hour of your day or you just need a place to sleep i recommend this class because just sit there and listen to her ramble on until you forget the topic of the discussion she is a nice person and can speak of good topics but at the end of the day wonder why you even went to class that day
1.0,W,unclear on assignments unprofessional and rude grading criteria on papers is extremely subjective she has no problem handing it extremely low grades for fully completed assignments taking again because of her
2.0,W,pretty rude and a unreasonable prof stay when she says to study do the homework and you should be fine her grading criteria is not to bad though gives what you give to her still would not recommend her though
5.0,M,great professor cares about his students as long as you do your work and extra credit pass
5.0,M,dr bob is the best proffessor i have ever met you have to take his class to believe he touched my heart he does everything possible for you to pass the class he has extra credit and he is flexible you will love his class
5.0,M,he is really nice professor that i have ever seen he helps me a lot i wanna take his class again
5.0,M,dr bob is an amazing instructor his lectures are beyond amazing and so enjoyable i took both is psych classes my first year at highline and i absolutely do not regret anything very organized too make sure to do those readings and study those before an exam there are no secrets just read memorize and study do the pt bonuses
5.0,M,one of those professors that remember for the rest of your life his lectures are engaging funny and packed with information that sticks with you he assigns a lot of reading and memorization because he wants the students to realize how much capable of every member of my class got to be friends with eachother
3.5,M,never dropped a class never not had a i walk into his class first few days are good a lot of handouts given but i loved his lectures he made the topic fun and enjoyable to learn but you have to study your butt off tests are really hard many of them they are long if you want a challenge have him as a teacher recommend
4.5,M,dr bob is the best teacher i have ever had he is respectable friendly funny and brilliant on the first day he gives you all of the essential information needed to pass the class it can feel overwhelming at first but incredibly helpful he fulfills his promise of teaching you all there is to know about human relations highly recommend
2.0,W,personally i enjoy this class while tas were very helpful and kind professor ho tended to go on angry rants during lecture very passionate but she would digress from the readings and run out of time educating us on the history tests were relatively easy if you did the or pages readings per week that is
5.0,W,asa is the best class taken so far prof ho is very passionate in her teaching and i suggest you participate ask questions answer questions sit near the front to be engaged in the course as she can go on tangents this course will fulfill a lot of ge but you got to work for it a lot of reading and papers discussion worth a lot
1.0,W,prof ho is one of the worst lecturers ever had in my three years at uc davis do not take her class asa with her was extraordinarily difficult and been taking upper division classes in ethnic studies for two years she cannot explain things simply she always has to take the long way around answering a straightforward question
4.0,M,i feel like dr andy is a love him or hate him kind of professor because he talks about things he likes poetry film music and gives lots of factoids in class it could mean amazing or bust depending on what type of student you are i personally liked him because i learned a lot during class and office hours he nurtures creativity a family man
1.5,M,he makes a great deal about being in class in order to pass yet all he talks about in class is his poetry or his books or his columns on newspapers he spends of the class time bragging about the same things on a daily basis how he got selected how he was awarded the bragging never ends it amuses me how he manages to sneak it in everyday
5.0,M,devastatingly handsome but mostly a great professor who cares a lot about his students make sure to speak up during critique
5.0,M,a great professor he goes into detail and explains everything to the t take him again
4.0,W,a good professor just very boring you always seem to get sleepy and just want to sleep all throughout her classes
4.5,W,listen to lectures do the homework read the book she gives good feedback and will clarify any questions asked
4.0,W,overall pretty good prof her lectures can be pretty dull but you have to remember it is accounting pay attention to her lectures and do the homework she is a generous marker so on tests make sure you write whatever you can as she gives part marks she even hinted at this during a test
5.0,W,she teaches straight from the book but she will go over it in class before you attempt it just in case the book was not clear enough the actual class and material were easy and she simplified it even more great teacher
5.0,W,professor herbert is by far my favorite professor i have ever had online or in a classroom she was extremely helpful and truly cared that her students understood the materials she also made it to where success was easy if you put in the work i appreciated her teaching style very much and would definitely recommend her as a professor
5.0,W,easiest class i had last spring semester mrs herbert is a very inspiring and amazing instructor she helped me so much and inspired me to keep following my dreams as long as you listen show up for class every time do the work and ask questions than an easy a i received an a in this class i would take her again in a heartbeat
4.0,W,she was a good instructor but really she instruct anything everything was based off of your textbook and a lab website i had some issues arrive and she willing to work with me outside of one instance the only reason i take another one of her classes is because its not really my thing i take much away from it
5.0,W,the class is about she goes through all if you know much about functions and querying in these program you will do just fine she teaches you the basics and then goes very in depth so pay attention everything comes from the book so hesitate to get ahead of the game grading is amazing hundreds of points likeable
5.0,W,i took this class for an week semester pretty good with microsoft office in general so this class was pretty easy plus herbert is very nice and everything is very clear i even emailed her and asked if she would open a couple tests up early so i have to take it finals week and she totally understood and opened them up
3.0,W,cindy she is okay i guess she expects a lot of work for a bs computer class you have at least to assignments due each week and then when you do them and you follow the directions as best as you can she takes off points without explaining why so you can better yourself i mean do the assignments and be fine
4.0,M,you have about homeworks per semester the tests are based on the concepts covered in the homeworks be afraid to go to his office hours he will try to help you without giving you the answer directly his class is challenging but you will learn something
3.0,M,he is pretty funny but can be hard to understand due to his accent costa rican i think the biggest problem i had was that we would learn the material and have homework then start learning the next topic then have the test on the previous topic a week or two into the second one more of the fault than his
4.0,M,danny fon is a great teacher if you go see him in office hours he will give you the answers to the homework final is not cumulative i would recommend taking him
5.0,M,if you are looking for an easy a do not take him he is a great teacher he knows what he is talking about if you go above and beyond on the world he gives you he rewards you with bonus points i would recommend him but not if you are looking for a easy grade
3.0,M,dr curra is a great person he really knows what he is talking about unfortunately he will lecture from the start to the end of class without taking a break there is so much information and a lot of it is unclear his tests are extremely hard take him if you are looking for an easy a
3.0,M,mixed feeling he is really nice but his voice is just too quiet and i cannot follow from time to time because of that
5.0,W,dr carmean is a great professor and excited to take another class with her worksheet on a minute film and a quiz over the book every week no actual textbook but you do have to read two books show up to class take it seriously you will be better off for it
1.0,W,i took this class in spring of this woman is highly intelligent but if you one of her favorites then she will be rude to you i just asked just question in class during the mos she shut me up i learn anything from this class i wasted my money on the text book
5.0,W,mrs zrolka is the best math in gsu decatur take her you will not regret it she gives out review for every test all the quizzes are take home assignment the test is not difficult if you study ahead and complete the review she gives out extra credit and the best part is she is so orangized she is willing to help so use her office hours
5.0,W,best teacher ever posts her class notes on icollege which helped out when studying for final gave out extra credit if you need help she will tutor you in her office after class i highly recommend her
5.0,W,best math teacher ever come to class do the work and its really no way to fail i wish she taught every math there was lol i would take her class again again
5.0,W,best college algebra teacher on campus math was my worst subject but her teaching techniques are amazing and will help you better understand the math come to class do your homework and the extra credit and you will pass the class i left this class with an a
1.0,W,professor does not tell students about online projects due expects you to see something on blackboard hope for your sake you log on everyday gives feedback on a paper and if you fix it still gives negative feedback for paper somewhat scattered on what she tells students would not recommend
1.0,W,avoid this teacher even though her syllabus says no quizzes she does them and puts them down as assignments on blackboard if your on her good side you might pass but if you are on her bad side you might have to drop the class being late or unable to attend class an option lots of reading never satisfied with your work
2.0,M,rambles a lot he takes up half of the class going on his midkiff diversions paying money to get an education not listen to stories his in-class examples are nothing like the test questions and the homework problems are unnecessarily hard if you get above a he counts them as a because the program messes up the book sucks too
4.0,M,i loved midkiff as a person he was hilarious and told awesome stories a lot but sometimes his lectures were boring or there were things on the exams that we ever go over all of the homework is due at the end of the semester but keep up with it because it helps on the exams most of the homework was way harder than the exams though
5.0,M,pretty easy class a lot of the math-based problems are just plug and chug be careful with the conceptual stuff look at the notes he puts online pay attention in class do the homework and be just fine
5.0,M,dr midkiff is one of the most liked and respected professors in the me department he regularly assigns homework dealing directly with the material that will be on the test and devotes almost the entire class to working example problems so that you can actually figure them out on your own his lectures are useful and he has a good sense of humor
5.0,M,a little difficult to understand but i took this class at he focused more on computation than conceptual questions but does a great job at explaining both
2.0,M,not a great lecturer just does a few examples with little context or general formulas tests are moderately difficult and he is very stingy with partial credit no dropping grades or anything like that homework is very time consuming and small errors hurt your grade would not recommend if you very good at physics
2.0,M,so im still in his class right now but i wanted to write a review for people looking to take haque the beginning weeks of his class are very easy but dont be fooled the information picks up i would say go to his classes but his accent is very thick so its not very worth it if anything read the book
3.0,M,not bad not especially good if cool with physics mechanics you got it if not not easy to get help the first weeks you can skip some classes later you learn things he checked attendance randomly times over the semester
2.0,M,his accent is difficult to understand and not helped by his incredible messy handwriting have to teach yourself the material out of the book also very condescending to anyone who asks a question he gives a lot of homework but not too tricky his tests are almost always just like his review questions which is nice
2.0,M,i find dr sharif very difficult to understand his accent is thick his handwriting is messy and his lecture notes are unorganizated a lecturer that works examples without telling you what your solving for what topic on etc he also wastes a lot of class time waiting for the class to participate when no one knows the answer
1.0,M,professor sharif is not the professor to take dynamics with we spend class going over future homework examples while this may seem nice our homework did not relate to the first exam also when a student asks him a question in class he simply repeats what he has said before which is not helpful i would not recommend him for dynamics
4.0,M,sharif was a great choice for fluids he was very clear in grading criteria explained things very well and kept the class moving at a good pace i took the class during the second summer term but even though the class only lasted about a month the work required to do well in the class was very manageable i would recommend taking sharif
3.0,M,the accent is the worst part very hard to understand but the class overall is easy to pass with little effort attendance mandatory but homework is due every class he reviews the class before the test and a great indication of what to expect on the tests his tests are multiple choice and easy to do well on textbook used for hw
4.0,M,mr hu is a very nice guy but also one of the most difficult math professors ever had i struggled to earn a c but hu is very well organized and you can learn a lot from his lectures not recommended for the faint of heart but if you identify as a math geek and like a challenge then this is the guy for you
3.0,M,head of history department as with almost any elective at bentley he takes the classes too seriously and the tests are graded toughly that being said he does give you the list of terms and essay topics for the midterm and final a week in advance so that helps overall meh take again but a super nice guy who cares a lot
4.0,M,dr pecorino is incredibly smart no denying that however often times he forgets that he is teaching college students do the study guides and be fine for the tests go to lecture and make him explain the final however was awful i scored above a on every test and barely got a on the cumulative final of your grade
1.0,M,avoid him no matter what care about his students in the slightest since a research professor will nickel and dime you on every test so much so that all semester i never received full credit on a single question changes study guide questions to be nothing like test questions horrible teacher all around even bother with xc
2.0,M,dr pecorino is one of the most confusing professors i have ever taken i have never had to put in more hours studying for a class then his he will change every practice problem from the study guide on the test and confuse you to no end would definitely recommend taking any other econ class
1.0,M,hardest undergrad class had in my ec major exams are really hard would probably be easier if he gave you the tools you need your studying tools are to examples of the question which he will change drastically you need to memorize the textbook his slides his lectures and google all the info he give you if you want an a avoid
1.0,M,pecorino makes ec the hardest class at ua do not take him for this course half of the class dropped before halloween and the other half mostly has cs my advisor said this is possibly hardest class at ua taught by one of the worst teachers here do not take
1.0,M,dr pecorino is one of the worst professors at ua i am a straight a student and i think he makes class as hard as he can i do not recommend his ec if you have another elective you can take
4.0,M,there is a lot of extra credit and he is very fair in the grading criteria he is super sweet if you show up to every class you get four points on your final average would take him again
4.5,M,dr pecorino is honestly a great professor his lectures are somewhat boring but economics the grading system is incredibly fair and dr pecorino offers very generous extra credit if you show up to every class he will give you points on your final grade you can get an easy a by just showing up to class and studying for exams
5.0,W,she is so sweet and understanding
1.0,W,i express how much i disliked her and this entire course this course should have been driven through discussion and opions but seems too only care about her opinions she give too much work and grades way too harshly if you miss one small thing on notes alone you will fail that assignment do yourself a favor and avoid her at all cost
1.0,W,this professor only lectures about why students should be good people and be classy come time for our midterm everyone asked what the test was going to be on because no material was covered or understandable in class there even enough time to take her midterm because she talked the majority of the time about her day never again
2.5,W,professor lee stated from the first class that she is a strict professor however sometimes she is unclear with what she expects her discussions were interesting although sometimes irrelevant from the topic but the time go by faster her class is easy to pass if you do the work and ask questions when her instructions clear
2.5,W,do it just so much reading she goes off topic not clear about anything remember due dates the midterm and final are essay exams late to office hours the subject is interesting but her class is no bueno
3.0,M,dr beneski has a pretty monotoned voice but he knows his stuff his lectures are dry and can be ridiculously boring but going is essential and worth it it is a hard course but it is totally doable flash cards will be your lifesaver
1.0,M,beneski is an intellegent man he knows what he is talking about but is an awful professor he has no idea on how to relay the message anatomy is a comprehensive class in which you have to take a question test in minutes its absoutley obsurd i got roofied one weekend and he let me re-take a quiz i had my hospital records also
3.0,M,some people are not used to the terminology so that can get confusing if you already have prior knowledge about anatomy the two most important things are attending lecture and taking really good notes his tests are all based off of what he says so re-read your notes to understand thoroughly
1.0,M,dr beneski was by far the worst professor i have ever had he was impatient cocky and he was not very good at explaining the material most students have to retake his courses and he is proud of it i strongly suggest you steer clear of this professor
3.5,M,beneski is a little monotone but if you pay attention very good at explaining and the class can be easy skip class he has powerpoints online but he goes into much more detail during class say something once and it might pop up on a test take good notes overall a good teacher
5.0,W,this class was interesting and an easy a really trish just wants you to show that you are involved in this class she is a clear grader and her readings are all online saves you a textbook her tests give you two chances to pass so that makes it really convenient
5.0,W,i learned many things about health science from her class class discussion posts are confusing hard to follow she gives extra credits so if you work hard be fine read the material carefully and do quiz no textbook everything is online
4.5,W,you can tell she loves to teach incredible helpful and fair no textbook required all reading is online her syllabus is very clear would highly recommend taking a class with her she is also a phys ed instructor so you might see her around the wellness center a lot
5.0,W,i have taken classes with trish and she is pretty amazing if you have taken biology or chemistry before health class should be easy a gives a lot of extra credit and her assignments are so fun to do
5.0,M,rick is a wonderful professor--engaging intellectual and intelligent he is passionate about political science and how it affects daily life lectures can be dramatic amusing and poignant although you probably need to take notes work is minimal i ended up writing down many inspirational things he said awesome class and teacher
4.0,M,this professor has an innate understanding of the american government and taught it in a way that students could relate to i really enjoyed his lectures i came into this class prepared with a notebook thinking that be a lot of powerpoint notes have to write down but i was mostly just writing down quotes of cool stuff he said
1.5,W,this lady is crazy i took her for calc expecting it to be not as bad and boy was i wrong she makes no efforts to make sure her students succeed hammers everyone on grading and her tests are impossible not to mention the racist rant she went on in the middle of my class she can explain it well but other than that awful stay away
4.0,M,professor rose was phenomenal one of my favorite professors his lectures are engaging he is extremely knowledgeable about the media communications industries definitely take him if looking to learn a lot work hard have a professor who truly cares about each of his students i would absolutely take another class with him again
5.0,M,professor rose was the only professor my first semester who really challenged me his lectures are consistently engaging but he expects a lot from each of his students if you think you can meet some high expectations take his class extremely helpful very clear in what he wants and very passionate and knowledgeable about what teaching
4.0,W,dr donahoe is very passionate about her work which makes the class so much better the homework assignments are through pearson so they can be kind of difficult the quizzes are online but pretty easy there are tests and a final not cumulative and she drops the lowest score of each category the only thing i like were the labs
2.0,M,not helpful at all he left on two trips during the semester and did not care at all study edge and his class notes barely helped either
4.0,M,talham went to chemistry seminars around the world in his absence the ta would take over the course the ta sucked at lecturing talhams lectures are very interesting though he use power points i finished with an which is an a one important thing use study edge as supplement if you wish not as a learning tool understand the notes
5.0,M,he is a great professor and seems very cool
4.0,M,talham is a great guy but thinks we are geniuses he made the final very hard but because the average was pretty low he changed the grade scale to help us out a bit i had an which was an a in his class so yes its hard but the scale makes up for it i studied so hard for each exam but every exam was very difficult and he covered more topics
3.0,M,dan took the last two weeks of the semester off when material was taught by tas that would make up of the final exam tests were hard study at least a week in advance and read the text book he is not a horrible man or teacher hes just harder than other professors he covered two more chapters than the other chem class
4.0,M,dr talham was a great lecturer and very kind unfortunately he taught for years so none of his practice exams were up-to-date he assigns lots of optional reading and problems but you have to do them if you use study edge being horrible at chemistry se saved my grade awesome review sessions and practice problems
1.0,M,avoid talham at all is an extremely uninvolved professor i believe that he does care about chemistry and teaching however he has not displayed that this semester his exams had nit-picky details and he went at a considerably faster pace than all the other teachers for this course the only practice exams provided were over years old
1.0,M,i would never take dr talham again was out of town the two weeks before out first exam and the week before finals tests are very hard and he gives practice exams from and which are not helpful would recommend anyone else yeah hes a nice guy but thats about it would not recommend
4.0,M,very knowledgeable teacher his tests are not easy but they are only of material covered in class and nothing new or tricky knows the answer to all questions and is very nice and respectful can get an a but you must work for it and study for the test a day or two in advanced fair teacher and very good balance of material learned vs difficulty
5.0,M,he is a super nice guy and want the best for his class that being said if you go to his office hours he turns into a mean person and kinda judges you but other than that he was awesome and would def recommend him
5.0,M,i absolutely loved dr talham he was very clear in his lecturing and made sure to use real world examples to accompany the topic if you ever have any questions he is always willing to answer them in terms of the exams he was very fair with his exam questions and always willing to discuss them with you after the exam great lecturer
4.0,M,professor talham is the best a cool guy who knows how to make chemistry interesting and a hard class accessible to students he presents the subject matter in a clear and concise manner and even hand writes the notes along with his students so you never miss anything because the professor is going too fast would take again
5.0,M,i loved his lecture style frustrating when professors put up slides and expect you to just copy them down while talking fast dr talham put slides up and wrote items down on the board and explained as he went lots of great visual aids in class he made a note to learn every name in class during summer a kind guy great lecturer
1.0,W,possibly the worse teacher ever had her lectures were scattered and confusing and often we ended up off topic this class claims no prior programming experience however this did not feel like the case considering i felt constantly lost despite reading the book and never missing class not good for beginning programmers
2.0,W,she is a tough grader tough to the point of being borderline unfair each project is correct or wrong if you had an error no matter how small you would get a zero luckily she lets you retry the homework you turned in for a slightly reduced point total which you will do a lot
4.0,W,not as bad as many students on here say she is she lets you know exactly what is going to be in the tests in her study guides she covers the important topics in class i had a bit of knowledge in cs before taking this class but the class would be just fine for someone who has no background in cs
2.0,W,although not receiving a bad grade at the moment i cannot deny that she is not the greatest of teachers she skips over some things in class and her assignments occasionally will cover things she did not discuss make sure you go over her review guides and do the reading and the homework otherwise probably fail go to the tutors
3.0,W,fine she straight up tells you that she takes pleasure in making questions so hard that people will get them wrong
1.0,W,i think it says something that the positive reviews all have negative user reviews whilst negative reviews have positive user reviews this professor is just awful stay away from this class i recieved an a so i am not just complaining her teaching style is godawful many people drop out of the major cause of her awful role model
3.0,M,very big ego if you patronize him and stroke his pride you will do well make him look good at the ashrae competition and he will help you if you challenge him he will lose his temper and his ears turn red smart but totally vain
5.0,M,his teaching methods are not normal he would yell at you and tell you that you did it wrong but on the other hand he would gladly help you correct your issues and understand what you were doing wrong he would even come in on saturdays to help his students learn and make sure projects were done on time great prof and helps with real world sits
4.0,W,agree you must read because she asks questions on the test about information not in the lecture but she also asks about information in the lecture material interesting class i learned a lot attendance not mandatory but you can get rewarded for good attendance
1.0,W,avoid at all cost she lectures the entire class time and the majority of what she says even what will be on the test she talks more about her personal life and personal opinions than the material that we actually need to know her test are tough and without the book you will have no idea what is going on this class is miserable
1.5,M,i generally love all my teachers because i check them on here this teacher however was extremely inappropriate he made jokes about handicapped kids the first day he spent at least two months looking at uncovered people mostly women and even admitted to going to an adult site for some of his material take again
4.0,M,chuck is a great professor he frequently leaves the country so classes are sparse and his grading sometimes can be questionable if you do the assignments and answer the questions get an a with no questions asked a very respectable man and probably one of the nicest people ever meet
1.0,W,shes horrible hands down take her class
1.0,W,awful do not take her class so hard to understand and never stays on track with anything worst teacher i have every had
3.0,M,ruhi can be intimidating when it comes to asking questions in class it seems like he gets frustrated for you needing clarification this class would have been a lot harder if i had not taken ap stats in high school although the examples he gives in class give a good insight to the tests he always gives a formula sheet too
5.0,M,teacher is passionate about what he teaches very thorough and explains what is expected for the exams assignments and homework
1.0,M,smart but rude to his students very bad at explaining the concepts to students ask him for help act like wasting his time if another option take another teacher spend hours reading the textbook and watching youtube trying to teach yourself
1.5,M,i have a very good experience with him i took him online and he was not very helpful at all no matter how many times i emailed him he always treated me like my questions were dumb a science major so i took this class because i was required to i tried to get help from everyone i could think of for his assignments but it never helped
5.0,M,dr vo is the sweetest old man his lectures can be a little dull at times but they are incredibly informative and are indicative what his tests will be like gives study guides and practice tests for all tests including the final
2.0,M,he was a really sweet and nice guy homework is really tough
5.0,M,i have him for cal ii his tests are easy and always give extra point for every test would take him again
3.0,M,calc with him at first it was hard to understand him trust me you get used to his accent give both online hw and hw he made up test is heavily based off the problems he made so if you can solve them quick ace his class
1.5,M,not nearly as easy as expected had to teach myself the course material because he is not only hard to understand but also does not explain things well at all he provides old tests as study material but sneaks in several unexpected problems he is known for giving wrong answers in study guides without even realizing it take someone else
4.0,M,a wonderful sweet man but he can be hard to understand at times his test are hard because the proofs are very specific but if you take detailed notes complete the homework and read the examples in the text book manageable
5.0,M,i knew him for years he is a tough and a hard enough teacher to make sure you will learn enough to get a job he is one of the smartest teacher in my animation program he is a very friendly person he does teaches new things like how to make a digital storyboard he also knows a lot of how the film industry works as well
5.0,W,although i understand music nor have i ever taken a music class she made things very simple the only way you pass this class is if you do any of the work if you put in the effort regardless of your test grades you will pass with an a
5.0,W,professor lindahl is a great professor who does a good job at explaining the idea of music to non music majors she gives you guided notes and if you pay attention you will do good on the exam she offers lots of extra credit and gives you ample time to complete assignments
5.0,W,professor lindahl was an awesome professor she is very passionate about music and it makes it easy to put in the effort if she can tell you are trying you will get a good grade attendance is highly recommended
4.0,W,susan was a great professor she gave many extra credit opportunities and allowed everyone to pass with at least an a if effort was put in showing up to class is not mandatory but is very helpful in order to receive a high grade she is very passionate about music but is also respectful to those that
4.0,W,i really liked her she was very respectful to students and understood that not everyone would learn at the same pace very organized loved the online quizzes that you could take until you reached lots of extra credit opportunities she really cared about music and teaching music to students who probably have never studied it yet
5.0,W,she is by far my favorite professor here at cmu she is so nice and is willing to work with you in any given situation there are quizzes online every week but you can take them until you get i took this as a writing intensive and there were only short papers so it was a relief i would definitely recommend her for mus
3.0,M,my only complaint with dr scripps web applications course was that his material was somewhat dated direct questions about or new javascript standards fell by the wayside that being said scripps has an interest in data science so his thoughts and answers on the internet and web technologies as a whole are very insightful
2.0,M,tough class he seems to struggle to help the students who know nothing about coding but is willing to do what it takes to help lots of projects which he go much over beforehand and he expects you to try it on your own first
2.0,M,if you do not pay attention you will not pass the class he is an extremely tough grader that being said you only get graded on separate things midterms paper and a final if you pay attention and do the reading you will be fine for the most part but showing up to class is a must or you will fall too behind and not do well good luck
4.0,M,i absolutely loved this class i would definitely recommend him as a professor a no-nonsense kind of guy and his lectures are really eye-opening to happening in the world
3.5,W,nice instructor will answer texts if you have questions about assignment grades based on papers and journal entries does not require textbook but will print out short passages for you to read lectures tend to be long but she seems to care that you do well and provides you with useful feedback fair grader and opportunity for extra credit
5.0,M,charming witty cultured and charismatic i would date him but this is not a dating site do the weekly assignments and study concepts he tells you are going to be part of the essay questions and study guides and you will do well in his class
3.5,M,he probably only has clarity and funny going for him his class requires to be fully engaged and participating every class in order for him to like you if you participating in his mind you trying and it seems like he grades your things even harsher for those who just like to listen and can learn without having to participate gl
3.5,M,boucher is a really chill funny guy he knows his lectures can get boring so he cracks jokes and gets off topic sometimes to make things more interesting you have to take a lot of notes so hard to know what you have to study but horrible at history and never read but i still got a b
5.0,M,jay ko told us one the first day of class if you pass this class with me you be taking it he give you all quiz answers in the lecture and the test are comprised of the quizzes
4.5,M,jay is a great teacher and is very clear in his description of calculus ii concepts he is extremely funny and always engaging during class the perfect balance of a teacher who actually does an effective job of explaining material and making class enjoyable
4.0,M,it was much easier paying attention in class jay he keeps things entertaining his tests are very standard he is more worried about understanding concepts than memorizing equations
3.0,W,very annoying voice she will get very easily upset with a class and will baby you in gba the material in the class is what makes it super easy study skills how to use university resources etc so the class is dumb anyways
2.0,W,i had an a at midterm and then she lost my papers after taking a leave of absence for over a week right before finals i can only imagine her do all of her grading and getting your grade changed is a hassle as she never replies to calls or emails being a professor is clearly not her job so beware
4.0,M,i had him for calc i would definitely choose him as a prof again homework mandatory which means quizzes and exams are the only thing he grades i study as much as i should have and when final exams came i struggled easy to understand and helpful outside of class if you show up to class you have any problems
5.0,M,i really like this professor one of the best math teachers at parkland he teaches with students and not down to them and always encourages questions and tries to answer them the best he can very pleasant guy to be around and found his grading to be very fair diff eq is a tough class but he wants you to succeed
2.5,M,he is a really funny and good guy and i like his personality class was also cancelled a cancelled a couple time so that was nice the in class workdays are optional so if you want to go on those days you have to the feedback he gives is confusing and the answers he gives very straight forward sometimes
5.0,M,highly intelligent and interesting professor be professional and participate as well as willing to learned something their is no right or wrong answer so be involve and have fun doing it the class will only be as hard as you make it i will definitely take his class again honestly enjoyed every moment while able to take with me some knowledge
4.0,W,this is a hard class i know that i done as well with a different type of instructor dr mills lectures are clear and easy to understand she gives you tons of practice problems that are similar to the graded quizzes and assignments get overwhelmed take it week by week watch the lectures and do the work proud of my a
5.0,M,this class is not easy so much work in connectmath insane but professor gutliph is great he knows you have lots of work to do and he tries to help you and make it easier on you as much as he can for example his discussions are easy and he gives a great review for your midterm and final exam definitely recommend
4.0,M,no matter what professor you take on-line a self-teaching class connectmath have any mercy on students load work is insane we had about videos to watch about questions homework and hour quiz each week not a multiple choice professor gutliph gave us a great midterm review will take him again
5.0,M,i would highly recommend mr gutliph there is a lot of work in connect math and it can be very time consuming so be prepared to do the homework if i have the opportunity to attend one of his classes in the future i will he is a great professor and actually cares that you pass his class
2.5,M,i took this class online in the fall it is basically self-teaching and i fell behind everything is on a e-book homework quizzes ect he teach anything you teach yourself lotts of hw find yourself behind i failed the class
5.0,M,a brilliant constitutional scholar that is not afraid to tackle the sensitive constitutional issues that confront our nation he is very clear about is stance on the issues the court but he does not attempt to get you to adopt his views he teaches the class in a fair objective and balanced manner and he will go out of his way to help students
5.0,M,dr rahimzadeh is an amazing professor in his class you feel respected and you want to be there he is so funny and smart very approachable and is so willing to help and encourage you there is a group presentation but most of your grade on that is for preparation so just do your work and be fine attendance is mandatory
5.0,M,dr rahimzadeh is brilliant and he knows it which can be very annoying been everywhere read everything and he thinks right about everything but also the nicest most supportive funniest professor had at eastern and yes nice to look at if you take his class you are missing out on a key eku experience
5.0,M,dr rahimzadeh is by far my favorite professor he is so helpful and tries to connect with each student i have been to his office multiple times and he always encourages me and tells me what to do to get better with my work he also keeps his lectures interesting and makes the entire class laugh constantly i would recommend taking him
5.0,M,a silver fox with a side of awesome sauce he has a gazillion lines of shakespeare memorized so every class starts with a performance sometimes with props and costumes really cool and really fun and learn tons just let him catch you staring at his eyes or his hair or his everything blush and it will be awkward
5.0,M,this was probably one of the most amazing classes i have ever experienced in college dr rahimzadeh managed to make the most boring horrible ancient stories some of the most interesting things to learn about if you read the text and come to class there is no reason you get an a seriously brilliant and he will change your life
5.0,M,there is a lot of work to do in the class but it made me feel like i had earned my a i like everything we had read but his lectures about the texts were so much fun and his knowledge blew me away he explains the importance of every text and is just overall a great teacher highly recommend
5.0,M,i want to take john milton but had to have an upper level now obsessed with him and the renaissance era this was most intense experience had at eastern and pretty much every one of dr lectures blew our minds brilliant and passionate and he is beautiful to look at and listen to take anything he teaches
1.0,W,ever expect monica to cut you any slack because its guaranteed she wont
1.0,W,very rude is not empathetic at all does she have human emotions no one knows
1.0,W,really terrifying make sure you study for your lab quizzes and be prepared for her to be really harsh
4.0,M,i would take him again now that i understand his grading and standards they made clear in the syllabus so it took a while only two quizzes but they are definitely challenging essays are hard to figure out at first but there are and a discussion every week overall not a bad class just depends on your preference
3.0,M,a good professor his lectures to long or boring he does group and solo activities so you just sitting there listening to him talk there a lot of reading from the textbook and he is a nice person i would recommend his class because not boring he rude and the material is interesting
5.0,M,i am in psy now spring and he has only five essays in weeks plus short opinion questions it is almost impossible not to get full credit he does was want references in apa style and does not permit direct quotations the tests are bit hard
2.5,M,this professor gave wayyyy too many assignments we had several repetitious assignments within the first week i do not like the way he organizes his work on blackboard he is just a confusing professor overall i would not recommend taking him
4.0,W,prof phillips was one of my favorite professors had so far i took her blended biology class so i only saw her for a lab once a week the weekly workload was very clearly lined out and i knew what was due and when she was pretty lenient on due dates if you asked her and was always willing to help i would highly recommend
4.0,W,prof phillips was awesome she is an extremely kind woman who will help you out if you ask also very flexible with due dates i learned a lot but there were times when i was just confused on what to tests and assignments too bad there is one big semester project that took up a lot of time take prof phillips loved her
5.0,W,theres not really much to say about her besides she is an amazing teacher she loves what she does and when she starts to get in to it you can see her eyes light up she is incredibly sweet and will help you if you fall behind tests and quizzes are open book and the semester project is big but worth it in the end
4.0,W,professor phillips is a very good professor she really cares about her students and wants to seeyou succeed her lectures can be confusing sometimes because she goes off on tangents she responds to emails in a timely manner and is always willing to help out after class if you have questions just remember to go to class or you will get lost
5.0,W,mrs phillips was not the best at getting back to you on time via email but if you stayed after class to talk she is more than willing to hear you out and fix any problems your having
5.0,W,i really loved professor phillips i genuinely enjoyed attending her class each week there were sometimes when the assignments were a bit confusing but she was extremely lenient with due dates when she knew that we were confused she always e-mailed back very fast and was always very willing to meet up whenever needed she is also super nice
5.0,W,professor phillips is terrific she loves biology and cares about her students she is knowledgeable and will try to explain things so that you can understand everything is posted on bb so if you miss a lecture you get too lost i enjoyed the labs and videos i highly recommend
5.0,M,hard course but an excellent professor who clearly knows what he is doing it is a challenging course but if you put in the work then you will do fine
4.5,M,professor cody is proficient at what he does and his method of teaching is excellent he uses powerpoints and practice questions he ensures that the class has complete understanding of each topic before proceeding to the next he gives assignment for each chapter in an effort to make us practice and review the material on our personal time
1.0,M,i know how anyone could say he is good he started with chapter of the book which is crazy his test are ridiculously hard even with open book and the study sheet i had to withdraw from the class and get a w because if not i ended with a d no got an a in statistics but failing beginner math silly
5.0,M,amazing teacher easy class does attendance every class and believe in teaching on fridays there are two paragraph papers due every wednesday over interesting topics you are free to have opinions he judge really funny and will help you if needed even though you have a textbook you only need it for study guides
1.0,M,unrealistic avoid him he is so struck on himself that he does not lecture on important material he likes hearing himself talk he is interesting but a joke too
5.0,M,although his lectures are long and dry dr geib is good guy in this class you will give presentations write research papers terms and essay tests super flexible and willing to help his students
5.0,M,while class is very dry and can be somewhat long he actually cares about his students and is always willing to help you out a good guy
4.0,M,he is beautiful but not hot get a grip reviewers we even had this discussion in class he is very caring he is willing to help you are allowed flashcards on exams but i did not find that helpful his exams are very hard i would be making a much better grade if it was not for the tests you will spend lots of money on printing
3.0,M,i took this course in a freshman only class and he was trying to help us out but very successful i definitely recommend the course mainly because of the second half of the semester project the first half is all earth science and he tends to stop himself and restart a lot kind of all over the place nice guy though willing to help
4.0,M,dr rogers is one of the most encouraging kind professors i have ever had and cares more about you learning the material than passing a test which can be good or bad depending on how you look at it studying is all important there is a quiz every lecture and lab he is generous with grades if you show determination and come to class
5.0,M,dr bodek is very knowledgeable and his lectures are filled with anecdotes and details very pleasant just keep in mind that you must take notes at all times because there is no textbook for the weimar germany class other than two compilations of readings
4.0,M,excellent prof i took it as a summer course and we had to jam through the whole course but he kept things lively and even though he had so much material to cover in almost no time take his class again he mind if you get the previous edition of the book either saved me
4.0,M,dr bodek is seriously one of the best professors at cofc his lectures are amazing and his class was very clear cut he can acknowledge when assigned too much work and mind moving assignments around to better fit the classes needs i would take him for anything he offers
4.0,W,depends on her students way to much if no one responds when she asks the class a question expect a long awkward silence she does however make her lectures clear and is always there for you if you seek help in her class
3.5,W,dr blanck is such a nice lady but an okay teacher really not bad but shes not the best her classes feel long and her lecturing isnt too great at least in y opinion she uses powerpoints a lot but make sure you write down what she says too shes so nice and will help you with anything that you need even outside of class
1.0,M,he really knows nothing about what he is teaching go back and get an accounting or marketing degree
2.5,M,a decent enough teacher although you will learn more through the assignments and research than from him and his lectures really tough grader on projects and papers and can be unreasonable my main problem with him is that unless you are interested in venues or planning he really helpful outside of class
3.5,W,she is so lucid gentle and playful one feels as though one were accompanying her on a joyous and novel journey through the ecstatic maze of the phenomenology
3.0,M,he made me hate international politics should not be teaching lower level classes
1.0,W,i am a genetics major and science is the love of my life this awful teacher left me wondering whether i should even be in the field of science after every class she is horrible sarcastic soul-eating and her revered lab manual is the stuff nightmares are made of my only recommendation is that if you have to do not take this class
5.0,M,he can be aggressive and loud in his lectures but he just wants to get his point across he is absolutely flawless at explaining things and is very funny and friendly i would recommend taking his class for sure absolutely worth it
5.0,M,mike is a great teacher to have for intro to programming i had zero programming experience going into the class but his teaching made it easier for me when he is explaining topics and theory he really makes sure what he is saying is clear the class is known for being hard which is why easiness is but if you go to class and work do ok
4.0,M,i had no previous programming knowledge before this class and i walked with a b his lectures are funny and interesting he dumbs it down so you can understand the concepts go to the sl sessions free tutoring and anything free is good they help clarify the lectures and are hands on mike wants you to pass so you have support there
2.5,M,mike does not care about his students the only way you will do good in this class is if you work your ass off or have previous coding experience this class is very stressful and you have to put in like hours a week just on homework if you understand they do offer sl student learning sessions but they all that helpful
5.0,M,shane is a stand up guy if you show up to class and engage you fail he always gives class time for labs and allows a cheat sheet for tests put in some effort and you should have no problem getting a good mark
3.5,M,shane is hilarious and really good at explaining concepts you need to practice your code and show up to every lecture his tests were really challenging compared to the labs more than willing to help you if you need it there are sl sessions you can attend with a student tutor which are free will supply duo-tangs for labs thanks shane
4.5,M,he is an incredible instructor for database fundamentals funny gives good analogies and is extremely quick-witted you could ask him anything related to databases and he would give you a well-thought out answer on the spot whenever a student had a question he mind taking the time to explain things over would highly recommend
4.0,M,sure he might be a bit rough but he explains the ins and outs of design from sequence diagrams use cases to screen designs able to point the flaws and mistakes when you submit a document
1.0,M,truthfully i took classes in dmit expecting to receive a scholarly perspective i dont think he even has a degree as a group we learned the same as watching a youtube video presented by a yr old
1.0,M,he was nothing but a bully disguised as a teacher yelling and taunting kids were his main teaching methods if you can switch out of his class
4.0,M,a big heart under his rough exterior made what should have been a boring class entertaining and worthwhile he does like to pick on students but it is all in good fun and he rewards students that pout in effort let his gruff hunter persona fool you either he is one of the most intelligent people in the faculty
2.0,M,attempting to stay conscious in this class takes skills beyond the average human one of the most boring professors ever had lectures the entire class period and takes no effort to engage his students especially in a subject like marketing this is pure torture takes random points off on exams and bores you to death do not take
2.5,M,pretty funny which makes even hour lectures feel short although he is probably more skilled on how to make his students feel stupid rather than the actual subject of philosophy i started out the class with about classmates and half way through only of us were left you have to work extremely hard to even receive a b would not recommend
4.0,M,the class was hours long but his lectures made it feel so much shorter clearly passionate and extremely knowledgeable about the subject he has high expectations of his students so be ready to make an effort if you want to pass as for those of us who survived to the end of the semester we loved him
3.0,W,pretty bland module but passionate about what she teaches
5.0,M,snider is not an easy grader if you want an a in his class you will work for it on the other hand he is hilarious and never fails to keep your attention siab for life
5.0,M,the best math professor in his field makes difficult concepts very easy to understand gives homework everyday for practice but also solves it for you next day do those and you are all set extremely intelligent helpful and knowledgeable makes learning easy by the way he teaches take him if you want to learn be good at math get a good grade
5.0,M,no sympathy for anyone who struggles in this class prof chung gives review guides and his exams are quite similar to his exams even if not a finance major this class difficult and he is a good prof the material challenging and really it is an important course make sure you attend class because the powerpoints are blank
5.0,M,dr arrey wrote the book on organic chemistry literally he uses a textbook that he wrote himself the funny thing is more helpful than traditional textbooks dr arrey has such a unique and often hilarious way of explaining difficult concepts that achieving highly is inevitable study hard go to office hours and be a chlorine guy
4.5,W,gadbois is entertaining and easy to listen to as long as you commit to learning she will do everything she can to make sure you are successful in her courses fair grader gives of feedback and even outlines for her exams i love her almost makes me want to switch to a psych major so i can continue taking her courses
1.0,W,more work required for the final exam than year major projects and minimal feedback i feel like guessing to find the exact study she wants cited
4.5,W,absolutely love classes hard to catch in person but always available through email and gets back to you really fast i found her tests super easy as long as you pay attention in class and study definitely would take any class with her again best class ever

1.0,M,sadkowski is the worst professor had at uni sadkowski lacks organization shows up late to class daily is regularly not prepared and fails to make this course interesting he relies on the textbook to cover all of his material sadkowski teaches heavily through pointing at maps and listing european countries dates and leaders rapidly
3.0,M,sadkowski lectures the entire class and it can get boring there are only exams and a couple of quizzes for grades and even with doing all the reading they were pretty difficult he gave ec on the last two exams which was really nice he is a nice guy and has some funny stories to tell at times if you ask him a question he is glad to answer it
5.0,M,whole outline of class is done by working in groups very very little class time spent on lecturing and more focused on working at your respective groups extremely intelligent and further sparked a passion in politics for me take if wanting an easy class he makes you work for it
4.5,M,professor peters is a good teacher he is passionate about politics and has interesting class discussions his lectures can get long and boring he does a good job of not letting his personal views get in the way of his teaching his quizzes can be difficult and he can be a tough grader you definitely have to work for your grade
3.0,M,class consists of six exams and two papers hefty reading assignments and no break between exams tests are online but are very difficult final is cumulative one of my favorite professors on campus and one of my fav classes wish i could take more classes with him
3.5,M,he was a pretty good teacher the tests are a little difficult but if you show up to class and take notes you will be fine really smart guy
1.0,W,i could tell she loves her subject but she is a bit scattered and that makes it hard to learn from her i enjoyed being in this class because of the classroom discussion but her lack of preparation is hard to learn anything from her so if you take her get the book read the book do those things and you will be fine
5.0,W,this is the second class taken with dr p and she never disappoints for someone who is enormously busy and hugely respected in her field dr p always comes prepared to class always has excellent feedback and knowledge to impart and always makes class engaging if you do the reading a lot learn so much highly recommend
1.0,M,worst professor i have ever had lectures jump from topic to topic hard to follow his train of thought type of professor that somehow is convinced that the shape of the letter g has to do with some deep meaning in the text and the author definitely meant to do that no sitting in class right now with him ridiculously annoyed
2.0,M,his lectures were very confusing he pretty much talked and occasionally wrote words on the board you can get by without doing much of the reading and it was an easy b
1.0,W,absolutely horrible does not teach at all class is a waste of time she just reads the powerpoints out loud to the class never learned anything from her just taught myself everything with the book if you read the book be fine for the exams if you can avoid taking her then do bc social psychology is very interesting just not with her
2.0,W,i buy the book because she here for the first week of classes ended up with a b and i normally get she does not teach she reads tests all multiple choice last tests she gave study guides because no one was passing pretty out-there and rambles a lot may have done better if i bought the book but unnecessary
2.0,W,she is a great person funny and personable but she teach be happy if just a ge class but if a psych major be disappointed about how much you learn an easy a though
1.0,W,dr perdue is the worst professor i have ever had she does not teach well at all the only grades you get for the class are exams including the final and the wording of the exams is difficult to understand very awkward teacher and she care about the students switch if you can
1.0,W,avoid her teach at all only gives tests that are multiple choice the only way pass those is by reading the book because she doesnt make powerpoints or write notes rambles a lot class drags withdrew out of this class never taking a class with her again
4.0,W,sort of a tough grader but she makes her expectations very clear and gives a lot of good feedback

4.0,M,prof walker is the best professor had here at iu always willing to help you understand the material and is committed to student success grades tests and returns them within hours while this class requires good calculus knowledge he makes all the calculus applications super accessible i would love to take this course again
4.0,W,i was very intimidated at first but it as bad as i thought i am not very good at anything related so it was tough for me but i ended with a b you just have to participate in the discussions as much and as well as you can it was online but she seems very easy going and friendly

2.0,W,tests quizzes she teaches very fast but as long as you go over your notes again you should be fine i got an a on every quiz and test you do not need the textbook the example problems she gives during class are very similar to the ones on the tests and quizzes you need her notes to do well so go to class class is points total
3.0,W,her tests are tough but luckily she curves grade is based off quizzes and tests i would recommend you take her she truly cares about her students passing and understanding the content
2.0,W,i would not recommend park for people who struggle with math she speeds through problems assuming everyone is following along tests are whatever still failed the class because your grade is solely based on and final this prof is great people who are good at math or have taken stats before
5.0,W,dr kim park is my absolute favorite professor funny makes the class super interesting very helpful and she makes sure that be able to understand the materials and pass the class having her as my professor was such an honor lectures are fun make sure you show up on time and miss class do great no textbook use
3.5,W,lectures are essential to passing she goes a bit fast but if you do the homework that she assigns optional but useful then the tests will go smoothly always available to help during office hours she gives extra credit by adding to of the tests that the class as a whole did bad on she do make ups so miss a test day
4.5,W,like a normal college professor your grade depends solely on quizzes and tests but worry probably curve of them the book is helpful if new to stats especially if you want an a but she collect hw calculator is also very helpful since you can just calculate the answers on it for tests and she lets you saved me tbh

4.0,M,go ahead and ignore any review before as changed his style tests matter grade wise study the powerpoints supplement with the book if needed do the hw go to class ask questions so he knows who you are and the a is yours if you understand the pathways then the final is easy his tests were easier than
5.0,M,dr chambers is an awesome professor dr chambers just made it easier to learn biochem but you still have to study alot anyone who complains about him was just being lazy and wanted an easy a i just took a practice mcat and scored with no studying or practice because he makes you learn and understand not just memorize
3.5,M,in terms of research he is very cutthroat he will do anything for grant money to beat out his competitors even if it means playing unfairly not personal just business great professor in biochem though
1.0,M,took this auditing class this was the only class in the entire program i c received a grade below b because he teach anything and tested you on everything i personally complained to the dean multiple times and was told he was tenured and nothing could be done to him waste of tuition seek another professor if you can
5.0,M,this review is for an online summer class you have to put the time into reading and understating the content it is not a difficult class but you must put an effort into it i highly recommend his online class account is like learning a different language it takes putting into practice what you learn to ensure that you understand it
5.0,M,took him for accounting and got a b it was a breeze despite having another class during that period you just have to contain yourself and you can end up with an a or a b
4.0,M,i took his week accounting class and got an a homework assignments are as clear as ever he uses connect from mcgraw hill for the entire class the homework assignments have video examples that teach you how to solve the problems use all ur connect resources and you will pass make sure to do extra credit it really matters
3.5,M,professor ludwig gives extra credit so if you mess up on test the few extra points will help you and that was very much appreciated he also responds to your emails in a timely fashion i took course online and was a little confused but once i got the hang of it i was good you can repeat assignments for better grade and just fantastic
2.0,M,professor reed and his lectures are very monotone dry and boring i only went to class twice outside of the tests which are essays and still received an a going to class and buying the book are not necessary at all but going to the ta sessions the days before the tests are crucial to passing they go over exactly what you should write
5.0,M,professor reed is a really cool dude he really as intimidating as you think the class is based off of tests that are essays that may seem hard but it really that bad especially if you attend the ta sessions i was an hour and a half late to our final and reed let me take it with the full time in the testing center blessed
5.0,W,this was my first history class in years but professor borgwardt made it really accessible she was available readily outside of class to answer questions and her lectures were engaging and helpful she expects a lot from you in terms of readings but very clear about her expectations and helps you meet them
4.0,W,professor borgwardt is a very good professor who gives engaged meaningful and insightful lectures personally i can find her to be a bit verbose and can spend too much time explaining the philosophical concept behind an assignment however the quality of her lectures and openness during office hours more than makes up for this
5.0,M,prof burbank definitely knows his stuff we always talked about current events for the first minutes of class before jumping into lecture his lectures are occasionally boring but that was more the subject than him if you read the text there a big need to go to class
2.0,W,hard class with arbitrary requirements jams tons of info into her powerpoints and tests on the most random things and is strict on papers and every mistake brings it down a letter grade hard to do well in this class without studying like crazy ewa helpful and feels that ok to expect the unreasonable of students take her
5.0,M,honestly one of the best classes i took he divides the semester into three major portions and his exams are only on what the material that was covered previously he does give a cumulative but its not a regular cumulative he lets you decide what you would like to discuss out of the topics that were covered throughout the semester best teacher
5.0,M,he is an incredibly caring professor and genuinely wants all of his students to pass a credit class so really hard to fail unless you do any of the assignments he believes in all of his students and is probably one of the sweetest professors at sjsu
5.0,M,easiest teacher for this course barely any effort required and easy final assignments a week group project and final take him for that easy pass on
5.0,M,classwork and homework assignment is due each week this class only meets once a week for weeks so i think the work is fair and extremely easy he wants all his students to pass you have to sign in every class but you can leave as soon as you finish your classwork highly recommend
5.0,M,extremely chill weekly assignments one in class one for homework he tells cheesy jokes every class and is super cool it is a credit class and he grades mostly off of participation completion of assignments very easy class with only a little bit of experience with excel
5.0,M,go to class mike is very understanding so if you have conflicting responsibilities talk to him takes late work you can do assignments ahead of time and only show up to class for minutes to get it checked encourages talking in class assignment grades based on whether you do them or not not correctness allows internet on exam
5.0,M,prof splane is the cutest professor ever he really cares about you learning he created all his assignments himself and really wants students to get a good understanding so they have the most potential when they get out of college loved his class
4.5,M,great professor must take his class

5.0,W,she is so fun just make sure to not miss class but even if you do she allows as many makeup classes as you want super cool
4.0,W,the only reason i gave this professor a was because of her lack of communication and her assignments were not clear of the time i took her online class i recommend if you want an a i passed with an a because i did all the work on time really all you have to do not hard at all can be confusing at times all
5.0,W,i took the online spring course and it was easy yes you will have to read the whole book but interesting information the test and quizzes were simple and easy if you read the chapters she answered all my questions in a timely manner she uses a point system instead of grades which i actually liked i would take her again
5.0,W,dr douglas is so helpful i had a mishap with the textbook company they put me in the wrong class for weeks was working on the wrong material annoying but she was understanding and gave me an extension for the material to be turned in paper online read and try and be fine very take her
3.0,W,she is a very nice teacher but you defiantly cannot slack in her class quizzes were given every week so reading was a must and so was attendance
4.0,M,class is easy to follow he gives info that is helpful for the future testing is practically given to you no book required programming part is step by step if you have problems with your tech he will help you with it overall great class would take again and he is funny
2.0,M,i appreciate how clear glen has made his grading criteria and class schedule i just felt as tho his lecture exams had low balled questions on tiny details mentioned in lecture word exams are easy tho enjoy this class but you might
3.0,M,this a hard class as long as you attend and go to labs he will never let you out early and he really loves what he teaches but is a little odd he expects everyone in the class to love the subject as much as him eye clicker is the way he tracks attendance but attendance is required he does let you make up missed labs just really boring
5.0,M,glenn is a helpful professor who want you to fail makeup policies are good you need the textbook but need the simnet pass which is pricey class is easy as long as you show up with the iclicker read his lectures before a test and good also do the simnet tutorials very helpful
3.5,M,he is a great guy very funny and the class was not boring at all he does not teach from power points so expect to be writing down what he says in class the readings are important to do class consisted of canvas postings one quiz group presentation and a cumulative final
4.0,M,a good lecturer at no time to you look at the slides on your own and feel completely lost you have a long time to do the homework just do four or five questions a day he will get into a conservative digression every now and then but it overbearing neither is his humor great class to be given a bone scorewise while also learning
5.0,M,one of the best professors i have ever had at tech i like that he always share his experiences in class i am not sure why other students said his lectures were boring i found his lectures interesting he shows that he cares for students future not just for students to get this course checked but learn nothing his tests were tough though
2.0,M,while it was evident that professor amrine knew his subject his lectures were dry and seem to pertain to the material that was on the final the final should have been easy as it was a take-home essay it really was difficult to know what he expected
1.0,M,this was a mini-course taken for hu credit but it honestly felt like hours of the amrine show we never had any discussion and he just talked for two hours straight i know why i kept going then the one paper that the grade was based on had criteria laid out no examples or anything i had no idea what i was doing and paid the price
2.0,M,took the minicourse for intellectual breadth a easy credit level humanities and i am a lazy engineering student he just kinda talks for hours then asks you to write a paper at the end of the semester i passed so i complain
2.0,M,professor is super caught up in his own opinions and thoughts on the material he is incredibly knowledgeable but does not present the lectures in a way that is understandable to students unfamiliar with the topics final exam was released late in the semester
3.0,M,dr wilson is interesting he talks to himself a lot and his lectures are boring but if you show up its super easy you can turn in hw whenever and all tests are take home tests the final is super easy and you practically do it in groups
5.0,W,doctor lorden was one of the most caring teachers i have ever had she made you work for it but she knew how to get you to really learn the material and while it was a tough class i can actually say i walked out knowing a lot of new things she did allow test retakes i miss her and if you had the blessing of being her student you were lucky
5.0,M,he is amazing he knows what he is talking about and is so funny that you want to pay attention and learn
4.0,W,whip-smart and clearly an expert in her field century british lit take any bull highly respected at mcgill go to her office hours
3.0,W,professor sparks is a ball of joy she is an excellent lecturer who is extremely knowledgeable of her mainstream field of expertise victorian novels century novels the lectures are quite heavy yet super interesting be ready to read a lot though novels of about pages each every weeks good feedback demanding conferences
4.0,W,i took her class for the syrce art history class her class is very easy and she makes art history kinda interesting she is very clear on what she wants from the class and is helpful with questions attendance does count for quite a bit but missing a class here and there kill you i would recommend taking this class no textbook required
1.0,M,he is a terrible professor and his grading system make almost every students in his class to get f you will never get from his project he will take off of your grade by saying you do not meet design he make it on his own term crazy professor stay away
1.0,M,very melancholic points on projects is either pass or fail so either or he will never admit he is wrong i got an f on a project because he stopped testing when it failed a test case that worked i went to see him and he would not admit that he was wrong even though i showed him java documentation showing he was wrong
1.0,M,gentle advice just take any online course under him he just uploads the slides and expect from you to learn by yourself never clear your doubts you will not learn anything from his course worst professor
4.0,M,this is my second class with professor white his tests are tough and he usually budge on partial credit the homeworks and project are totally doable just start on time overall i really enjoy phil and the way he teaches i really feel like i learned a lot regardless of grade
4.0,M,phil will refer to the textbook but his syllabus outline what sections of the chapter to read so the textbook a good tool to use for the class the labs and projects are doable if you start them early his exams are tough
5.0,M,phil white is honestly the best cs professor had at rit his style of teaching is excellent and really helps you get a thorough understanding of the material he is a very fair grader and is clear with his expectations he is often blatantly sarcastic and has a good sense of humor overall a fantastic professor
1.0,M,he is really awful professor and he does not seem like helping student during office hours
3.5,M,tests are tough but if you work on the labs and projects you can make up for less than stellar test grades a fun lecturer but does digress from the topic sometimes overall i enjoyed his class
1.0,M,awful professor his tests are ridiculously difficult and he give any hints about the exams avoid him or you will get d or f
5.0,M,really funny if your class is well behaved he really likes teaching not a super fun class but he makes it fun
4.0,W,good teacher make sure you go to class because the problems she reviews in class are the same on the exams and she does not record her lectures there are exams mastering physics homework and a final exam which is cumulative exams are all multiple choice some true or false
1.0,W,she is so off the wall and hard to follow entire grade is based off of exams masteringphysics and one final it her exams are all multiple choice and super specific to how she teaches if you dont write down exactly how to do her problems good luck
5.0,M,his dad jokes are amazing
5.0,M,great professor you need to study and show up to class but if you study his powerpoint slides you will do well on the exams he makes lecture fun and he jokes around a lot one of the best teachers at mcphs and he genuinely wants you to do well he gives some easy fun questions on exams sometimes for extra points i would take him again
3.5,M,dr kelley is unbelievably smart its fascinating how much he knows but he expects his students to know the same the class is very tough need to review all his lectures and the book and do the problem sets if willing to work very doable overall a great person and willing to help if you seek it funny too just pay attention
3.0,M,there many actual of the class were presentations held by students the grading criteria was very unclear although he usually gave good grades but be aware all assignments were group projects with the same group throughout the semester
4.0,M,he is really nice at teaching he mind at all even if you go and ask him the same thing thrice can be better he grades well if you write your answers correctly i amd my friends always scored more than what we expected
1.0,W,your grade depends on how much she likes you instead of how well you do with your work if you are ethnic minority the chance she like you is very high and be discriminated against in many possible ways especially in those areas almost impossible for students to challenge her decision she enjoys breaking hearts for no good reasons
3.0,M,professor fox is a nice man but his lectures can be boring
5.0,M,rudi is a very nice professor who is passionate about his work and cares about his students you will be required to attend out of field trips they get a little long but are actually pretty fun
1.5,M,he gives unclear lectures filled with off-topic interjections and ramblings ppt slides directly copied from the textbook are used for lectures boring classes with zero group projects no creativity i often walked out of class due to being so frustrated i barely studied and still gots on all my papers and midterms a total waste avoid
5.0,M,jazz history was an awesome class you need to know anything about music in order to get an a he makes the class very interesting by bring his saxophone and allowing you to hear the differences between different types of jazz he only grades you on quizzes but he goes over every question the class before love this class and paul
5.0,M,i enjoyed taking theory with dr roter as he was very clear about what he wanted in each paper had a mini-lecture about each piece in class and was very timely about returning papers and grades as long as you take notes and are in class you will be able to keep up with the workload i highly recommend taking this course with roter
1.5,M,worst class i have ever taken he is condescending and not easy to work with in the online class he calls out your discussion points in red that do not align with his philosophy and makes you feel like dirt when asking for help i wonder if he even likes doing his job pompous and grumpy stay away from this class if you can
5.0,W,had her for internal audit and thoroughly enjoyed the class and her teaching style the exams and group project count for the majority of your grade so take those lightly she provides handouts for her lectures and if you study those be totally prepared for the exams
1.0,W,took it online over summer that was the first mistake unfortunately i had no other option took her days to respond to my emails even then they were unhelpful mcgraw-hill based course which sucks not enough time for the exams and will leave you rushing to guess amounts of homework which take hours of your day beware
5.0,M,professor abramson is a fantastic professor he cares about his students so much and you will learn a lot in his class his exams are tough however taking one if his classes is absolutely worth it
2.0,W,i gave cynthia some credit for being encouraging but her tests are ridiculously hard and she is not approachable in lab for questions her midterms and final exams are beyond what anyone should be expected to know and when you ask a question in lab she will only tell you that not correct and walk away instead of being more supportive
5.0,W,cynthia will see you for what you are take her classes if a check in the box for your degree program but if passionate and actually care about the subject matter cynthia is an incredible leader help you realize your goals she will let you know if you cut out for the field which is a much needed trait in a teacher
1.0,W,she is very scatter brained although she knows her stuff her lecture is all over the place which makes it hard to take good notes she makes up and writes her own quizzes with a lot of trick questions so read the questions carefully she will expect you to read and fully understand the class information before coming to class very hard class
1.0,W,cynthia expects you to already know the material in class before learning when you ask questions she makes you feel stupid and says you should already know the answer and tells you to ask class members for the answer very scatterbrained jumps from topic to topic i learned absolutely nothing from her i learned more by teaching myself
5.0,W,cynthia is a very great instructor she really does her best to get everyone involved i enjoyed her class very much but not much of a morning person so my brain was only half awake very sweet lady
1.0,W,this was by far the worst class of all my classes offered at kvcc this instructor talks way above your head offer any extra credit to help you out and if you let her know you are struggling she will tell you straight to your face that you should reconsider your goals for the future horrible
2.0,W,cynthia is completely scatterbrained she adds new assignments randomly and due dates change all the time so you get confused by all of her confusion takes forever to grade exams hardly reflect lecture at all talks above what most people even know yet like we are already microbiologists when actually there to learn horrible teacher
4.0,W,cynthia is a very good professor she is very passionate in her work and knows her stuff if you put in the work and study you will not do well in this class she is the one of the best instructors at kvcc
4.5,M,barry is a very good teacher he will adapt his lecture depending how fast the class is going and will give very helpful advice at recitation
2.0,W,nice but not very specific on what is expected she does not use canvas she does not know grade unless you ask and she will give you an estimate rather than figuring it out you need to read the text often to prepare for reading quizzes and when she lectures she speaks in a monotone voice and reads from the book with no elaboration
2.0,W,i still understand why i had to take her class but she does not explain anything basically on your own she gets mad or aggravated if you ask a question that does not go with what teaching that day if you have a question she will make you wait until class ends or she simply says you should have asked me before class
1.0,W,if you have the option please stay away from her and any class she may teach after one whole semester i did not learn one thing of value she treats her class like going to be your major and runs it like a higher level course out of all my years in school mrs zacate was hands down the worst teacher ever had would never take again
1.0,W,i have never had a professor who was more vague on what she wanted from us when it came to assignments the only student who got above a c was the girl who got dearing a fifty dollar gift-card to this teacher does not care about her students and her lectures never matched up to what we read in the text books avoid her at all costs
4.0,W,professor class is definitely not easy but she is without a doubt a great teacher you really have to work for a good grade and attendance is mandatory to pass overall she was very helpful though and wants success for her students i would not recommend this class if you like reading she also was very helpful with writing papers
1.0,W,very unpleasant instructor i immediately dropped her class after the third day of having to sit in her classroom miserable also the first thing she assigned was to write a biography about our personal lives and then present it orally in front of the class on the third day awkward expect reading due every class and numerous essays tests
3.0,W,she was not there for the first two days of class and most of the majority of the semester but very strict with absences for students which i think is stupid and makes her a hypocrite very rude and egotistical a grader nazi so expect to get an a overall i recommend you take her and just leave her class now
3.0,W,grades really hard i do not recommend did not enjoy this class what so ever and felt really discouraged on one of my descriptive essays we had to do for class she wrote too much description sorry what awful
1.0,W,avoid her i stand her she thinks she is funny but she i wish she is dead
5.0,W,nina is the greatest choir director ever had she cares about input and does everything she can to get the best sound out of us possible in order to pass you have to show up but a given in choir and if you have too many absences she offers extra credit by attending festival choir amazing person and professor love her

5.0,W,she is funny energetic and really gets the students engaged in the class the notes seem hard to keep up with at first but basically an outline of the lecture shes giving and it goes in order you just have to follow along she cares about her students and wants them to succeed so if you go to her with quesitons she is always willing to help
5.0,W,the best instructor i ever had she makes learning easy because she makes sure you know the most important things she focuses what you need know for real life and exam which makes grading easy i got a in her class of anatomy and you can also get that as long as you strive for it
5.0,W,mrs brown is awesome she is the best biology teacher ever had she really wants you to succeed so she does all she can do to help you she is also very nice and though the lectures are boring she makes it fun this class is fairly difficult so make sure you miss days or you will be behind be on track with hw and study for your tests
4.5,W,the most amazing teacher ever have super funny and is always there to help takes the time to meet with you and explain stuff she is pretty straight forward on what she wants you to know
2.0,M,a great teacher and makes his lectures interesting but it his way of grading is completely random and unjustified he gave wrong instructions on what to focus on the midterm which resulted in a class average in the for the final we are supposed to value a stock without even having any complete financial statements
1.0,M,avoid him fun to listen to and he knows his stuff but his grading is ridiculous i completely agree with the reviews below make friends with him or forget your a switching section for him was the worst move of my final year at jmsb
2.0,M,one of the worst at jmsb finance avoid at all costs random grading criteria basically gives you a good grade if he knows you if you insist on taking a class with him focus more on becoming his friend rather than spending too much time trying to get right from another review but my thoughts exactly wow
2.0,M,one of the worst at jmsb finance avoid at all costs random grading criteria basically gives you a good grade if he knows you if you insist on taking a class with him focus more on becoming his friend rather than spending too much time trying to get right
5.0,M,he is very practical his class always involve real world cases and he is a easy marker i will definitely take another class with him
4.5,M,one of the best in concordia he explains everything clearly and he is always there to help you will regret if you have never chosen him
5.0,M,good professor his slides and explanation are very clear but he post them so you need to record them fast try your best to do the project
4.0,M,prof wong is truly considerate for students study progress and is willing help a student with good protaintials to achieve goals if you are a hard-worker he is the one to choose to take
5.0,M,one of the best professors in jmsb he teaches student practical skills and finance in the real word instead of boring textbook theory he knows that how important the gpa is when trying to find a job so he is never be a hard marker i learned a lot from students presentations and while improving my presentation skills
5.0,M,one of the best professor in jmsb he teaches student practical skills and finance in the real word instead of boring textbook theory he knows that how important the gpa is when trying to find a job so he is never be a hard marker i learned a lot from students presentations and while improving my presentation skills
1.0,M,this professor does not respect students regarding to his poor in-class sleepy behaviours and random marking criteria he will literally forbid a student from taking his class in front of the whole class rummer in school about him took over gifts from students who are pursuing taking his class it looks really bad if it is true
4.0,M,i found dr zhang very helpful in such a tough class he takes a lot of care in explaining proofs and making sure that the material is well understood the class moves quickly so make sure you do the homework to keep up always willing to answer homework questions fail you unless you try at all
5.0,M,love him also taking his nazi germany class and awesome as ever
5.0,M,dr spivey really cares about his students he has talked to me many times in his office about personal life stuff and class stuff he is very smart in his field of study his examples he uses in class fit perfectly with the material we cover
5.0,M,i wish prof dobson taught because he would be my first choice he is an amazing professor who knows what he is talking about all of class is lecture but it is engaging and easy to follow along sometimes he talks super fast but if you ask him to repeat something he will do it right away and make sure you understand i highly recommend him
4.0,M,dobson is super nice and he wants everyone to succeed if you go to class worry puts lectures on blackboard and easy to follow always got out of class early and he stays after class if you have questions
5.0,M,i was scared of this class beforehand because not really a science person however i truly enjoyed this class even at because prof dobson makes the content interesting and cares if you do well he lectures most of class but if you print off the power points it is relatively easy to follow along i would take him again if i could
5.0,M,one of the greatest professors had the pleasure of getting to learn from very tough material but thats biology for yah he did an incredible job at explaining methods
3.0,M,wants all students to do well but makes it damn near impossible does not give any extra credit and does not curve any exams which is annoying when all other professors curve their grades hard tests but if you read his powerpoints verbatim then you should be fine study for the quizzes because those are easy points and do well in lab
4.0,M,alot of people have given dobson a bad name but i honestly think that he does a really great job at actually teaching the course its a lot of material and he expects you to know it so its on you to study your ass off but he explains everything so its easier to understand and is more than willing to answer any questions lectures are essential
4.5,M,dobson is a great professor he is funny engaging and honestly teaches a lot to his students in the amount of time he has that being said he is incredibly difficult compared to the other professors that teach this class if you are looking for a good professor who will teach you material look no further if you want an easy a keep searching
4.5,M,professor dobson is a great professor if you are looking to not learn and what an easy pass he is not the guy to take you will definitely need to read and study a lot outside of class he give outline and base his test off of those he is very helpful and wants his students to pass i would recommend taking him if you want to truly learn biology
5.0,M,dobson is a great professor and you can really tell he wants you to do great in his class and genuinely cares about his job he is very helpful during lecture but you definitely need to read and study a lot outside of class to pass the tests
4.5,M,he is super helpful since its bio you know its going to be hard but he makes sure you know what he expects of you he tells you exactly what to study and how to get an a
4.5,M,professor dobson was a very nice teacher who made lectures interesting he was always cracking a joke during lecture the tests are very hard and if you study a lot you pass if looking to put the time in i would definitely recommend him
4.5,M,tells you exactly what you need to know and all information is in his power point lectures even if you understand the book helps a lot it can be tough but as long as you pay attention and study you will do well
5.0,W,as awesome as everybody says she truly cares for her students and goes above and beyond to further assist in learning the material she sends reminders listens to her students needs and always motivates her students as long as you do your part do great must take her class if looking into taking a child development class
2.0,W,where do i even start terrible you have tests and all hard considering the fact that she gives you correct answers and you have to choose the most correct answer make sure you understand apa front and back because she tears apart your paper for literally everything no point of going to class she reads off the pp
2.0,W,dr slusher accept a hand written love letter from channing tatum if it apa format she is crazy for the rules and reads the powerpoint word by word everyday good luck dealing with her voice tests are common sense but difficult because there are right answers but you need to pick the best one
1.5,W,better study because there are tests and one paper it the whole class lectures are pointless she reads off the powerpoint which btw are bright blue in lime green writing hard to read and i only went for attendance
2.5,W,having class along with the other two pre-nursing courses were a major wake up call for me i was used to making and ended up making in all three of the courses the tests are confusing you basically have to choose the answer want you to she grades the paper really strictly so make sure you take it to the lrc beforehand
2.5,W,not very helpful ask her a specific question and you may or may not get an answer tough grader she can also be rude at least she likes what she does
3.5,W,before i say anything else i liked ida as a human ida is the nurse that administered zyklon b to the jews but only if the apa formatting was correct ida is the definition of a bureaucrat she wastes of semester covering formatting pon paper is about format tests are mostly power-point
3.0,M,professor sposito a blindingly brilliant lecturer but he gets the information across clearly he really cares about the subject i think but just the most interesting lecturer he does post lecture slides on bcourses which really helps with exam preparation

4.0,M,prof class is extremely difficult group work every single day daily assignments can be confusing at times exams are super frustrating and hard the worst exam set up experienced at uvu he seems super unapproachable in class that being said one on one he is one of the nicest dudes you can go to him and he will help you out
3.0,M,he is a great teacher when he teaches which is not very often he knows the subject very well and is passionate about it however he hardly lectures the first day of the semester he sticks you in groups and you better hope you get a good group because you will be each others teachers for the semester

5.0,M,i took mr young for college trigonometry you can tell right away that he really loves math and he really loves teaching trigonometry easy for a lot of students but he really tries his best to explain everything as best he can now moved on to calculus and the fundamentals he taught are helping out a ton
5.0,M,horrible at math i had to take all of the development classes and barely passed those professor young is the best math teacher i have ever had yes i made an effort to learn the material but he really breaks down everything and never makes you feel stupid for not a concept take him if you struggle with any type of math
5.0,M,mr young is an exceptional teacher he takes an interest in all of his students and goes out of his way to help you he really makes math a fun experience his class is the most social and friendly math class i ever took mr young gives extra credit opportunities math handouts and videos i would recommend him to any student wanting to succeed
5.0,M,as a student that usually struggles with math professor young was great i took him online he makes instructional videos for every lesson that are a huge help you can tell that he genuinely loves math and he explains it in a way easy for anyone to understand
4.0,M,mr young is a great teacher unfortunately i struggled with his class but it is possible to pass his class sure i probably try hard enough but if i can pass so can you there is a total of tests practice tests with each test and homework throughout the week he also gives you extra credit for every test
5.0,M,mr young is an excellent teacher to have for trig he teaches with enthusiasm and offers a lot to help students especially during his office hours be sure to do your tests on to learn the hard way success depends on your efforts so be afraid to ask in for help i would highly recommend mr young
4.5,M,mr young provides a relaxed classroom environment he is a funny and bright teacher he gives an extra credit opportunity before each test most of which were just writing paragraphs about math site recommendations he puts all his effort into helping his class succeed could not recommend him more
1.0,M,definitely the worst professor i have ever had in my entire life you guys are stupid is just one of the many disrespectful things he would say to us please hire a new professor thank you professor leatham for showing me how not to be a teacher
1.0,M,i took him for geology never again i learn anything about geology in the class waited outside of his office for a grade check and he never showed up he also goes off subject a lot in the class and when he does talk about geology very confusing there are class evaluations due every class
1.0,M,leatham spends about of the time rantings mostly trashing students and the way we want to learn or are accustomed to do things he tries so hard to teach in a revolutionary way in terms of getting students to think for themselves really though there is no class assignments are crap he was a week late in submitting final grades
5.0,M,show up to lab do all the chapters he tells you make sure you turn in your evaluations each class and do as much extra credit as you want he literally has no limit you can do hundreds of points of extra credit easily my favorite teacher take what he says personally he cares about his students and has trouble expressing it sometimes
1.0,M,type of person who takes advantage of the fact that they have a captive audience due to students having to be there literally talks about anything he wants but geology always off topic hair brained and unprepared he tries to hard to be a professor that teaches out of the box would highly recommend staying away from his class terrible
2.5,M,a really confusing class at first but once you get used to it really fun i learned a lot most of it self directed i learned how to be more inquisitive and self reliant i enjoyed his class there are no tests but homework is due every class
1.0,M,dr leatham is the worst professor at csusb he is very unorganized he was weeks late in posting our grades he is very unclear he does not speak nicely or respectfully to his students his instructions and directions are very confusing worst teacher do not take him avoid him at all costs
2.5,M,prof douglass is one of a kind i guess when you sign up for the class it says strictly a lecture must have missed the memo the most boring class ever taken though if you like to listen to a monotone voiced man speak for an hour straight then go for it he does not use blackboard or handouts either only six grades for the semester
4.0,M,prof douglas really knows his info obvious that he enjoys teaching the class was strictly a lecture class which is told on the registration website so if your expecting a hands on exciting class almost common sense to not sign up for a lecture course unlike much of the class i attended every day and took notes i got an easy a
5.0,W,amazing professor my favorite professor at ba and main campus super friendly and extremely encouraging easy a uses real life experiences in her discussions everyone is always involved in discusssion which makes this class so fun to go to she cancels class frequently and cuts class short which sucks because i love this class so much
5.0,W,she is very kind so it is really easy to talk to her about things that are unclear she uses areas of her work to help explain certain topics better although it is easy to get an a in her class its just as easy to get an f if you dont show up or do the work
5.0,W,can use on exams check bb before class cancels frequently also dismisses early every day until end of semester child development was an easy class with her an easy a if you know how to write papers well enough
5.0,M,i took the radio astronomy course with professor bartel and i have to say he is one of the best profs ever had the course is very math heavy but if you do the assignments ask questions in class and listen to his lectures you will be okay he makes the material so interesting definitely learn something absolutely recommend bartel
4.0,M,this class was not as difficult as everyone is saying you must read the assigned chapters or you will not pass his test are difficult but the other assignments were basically free points the forums are opinionated and the research paper too bad he seems annoyed if you email him
3.0,M,class content overall not hard forum posts are easy and are based off your opinion the test chapters questions with minutes you do the math you have to know it if not you are doomed but so much information it really is hard to know what he will test you on
2.0,M,such a boring teacher literally reads off the notes he gives to the class for the whole class in the corner of the room hope he gets canned
4.0,W,not easy grades but definitely fair if you study and do the weekly readings you will easily get an unless you good at writing papers prof has excellent lectures easily the best lecturer i had in my first year sums up the readings really gives great examples and is very clear with concepts she is trying to explain
4.0,W,great prof very inspiring some found her lectures too boring but i really liked that she scripted it beforehand it cut down on rambling lectures were very useful more often than not there was new and interesting material readings were interesting syllabus was constructed well and assignments were light
5.0,W,claude is very thoughtful and intellectual with her teachings you can and will learn so much from her you can count on her if you have any problems of any sort she will be there for you with a genuine heart thank you for teaching us

1.0,W,if you want a teacher that teach recommend her she gets paid way too much money to not teach us she good at explaining her content well and expects her students to keep up with her nonsense i love learning and had plenty teachers and she is not one i would ever take again if this allowed a what i would put
4.5,M,excellent teacher i have taken both his and and have enjoyed them both he keeps his lectures interesting and well-paced throwing in the occasional corny joke just attend the lectures and make sure to study thoroughly before every test and the class is an easy a so hurry up and take this class before he retires
5.0,M,i took this course last year and it changed my life because he sort of became my mentor and just one of many mentees easy to do well in his courses but seriously if you show him effort it will be the best decision you ever make fun funny chill helpful and super well connected
5.0,M,one of the best profs at plu i graduated years ago and looking back he is still my favorite
5.0,W,professor luther is one of the best business professors salem state university if not the best she personalizes her teaching to suit each class and individually each student the information i received from professor luther is unmatched by any professor she helped me get the information i needed to get an internship and is not my advisor
2.0,W,she is one of those professors that expects you to fully understand a concept after one explanation of it the way she explains things is very vague and confusing she needs to find a different approach because the way she does now just cutting it please do yourself a favor and try and find a different professor
5.0,W,professor luther is a fantastic teacher she makes the class fun engaging and easy to understand the workload is manageable and the material is extremely relevant to the real world would definitely recommend her class if you want a solid understanding of the material
4.0,W,kathy is a very laid-back type of professor attendance is usually not mandatory as long as you do put in the work she does have very unorthodox approaches to assignments and projects and the medium in which she bestows it on her students however there is method to her madness and i do feel like i retain info from her classes
5.0,W,one of my favorite professors i have had her for photo and and am waiting to take she is passionate about her craft talented and loves teaching she take herself too seriously and is great fun her classes are work with lots of info but she uses a variety of media to teach it quizzes can be tricky
4.5,W,kathy is so much fun but if you want to do well you much keep up and do your assignments on time there is a lot of internet videos to watch many with her in them they are a crack up but you do learn a lot from them lots of work but it is always fun she is a great teacher
4.0,M,lectures can get a bit boring but he adds in really amusing stories about his life to help lighten things up minimal homework super short easy essays due every week on canvas and a final exam lots of extra credit opportunities
5.0,M,one of the best teachers had ever he tells great stories the whole course is basically lecture we have one final exam we have weekly assignments that are really easy loved the subject material he knows what talking about loved his lectures wished it was a bit more interactive would take him again if i could
4.0,M,a really nice teacher he really cares about the students
4.5,M,i loved this class he teaches from a sociology perspective and you learn so much quirky blunt sense of humor and tells the wildest stories one assignment per week with a final at the end of the course show up to class and do the weekly assignment the classroom dynamic is lowkey and comfortable super cool guy highly recommend him
3.0,M,i took global sociology class because my previously selected class was canceled he even wrote the textbook for the class plus free file he gives out for download i had him for criminology a few quarters ago too and it was very interesting some very crazy stories from his life and a very friendly guy overall
3.5,M,david is a good teacher he knows how to make the subject sound interesting no matter what it is he also has really good stories to tell if you have an opportunity to take a class with him do it you regret it the only homework he assigns is reading chapters a week and a weekly online discussion the final was open book open note
4.5,M,loved him he rocks so nice kind of awkward but the best type of awkward saw him downtown oly so cool he is opinionated but force his ideas on you i liked him
4.5,M,this guy likes to get deep tests are open note sometimes open book so it is super important to take notes if you miss a day you can always get the notes off of his power points or from a fellow student make sure you do all of the assignments on time that is where most of the grade is
5.0,M,i took emac class years ago jason maintains that perfect balance of friend and professor he knows how to earn respect from his students as well as give respect to his students i learned a ton from jason and his class really broadened my horizons as an artist and did so in a very encouraging way jason is an absolute asset to mica imo
5.0,M,lectures can seem a bit out of date and somewhat boring but he cares about his students and he really tries to make it easy for everyone class attendance and the oral presentation are gifts from him to you easiest of the grade just show up goes over everything that will be in exams class paper is easy just follow the outline no hmwrk
5.0,M,took him in the summer and he was absolutely phenomenal his grades are based on attendance oral presentation midterm w essay and final essay prompts are given week in advance to prepare for go to class his exams are based on lectures the book is helpful not necessary loved his laugh and his personality
5.0,M,a really good teacher tests are just the midterm and final he gives you study guide and practice with the class before the test and there is an essay question for the test he gives you the prompt so you can be prepared individual presentation is he just gives you a question and you have to find it in the book and present it in class
5.0,M,a freshman second semester my friend was signed up for blitz class and convinced me to take it with her i am very glad i did prof blitz class is fun but also serious about the idea of worlds he can be funny but also makes you think totally new thoughts about everything he has a nice coteacher who has her own style which is very nice

5.0,M,prof curtis is so funny his class is very much laid back but be prepared to do a paper every week the paper topics are not hard or lengthy words just make sure you do them no exams and he is active in his field and encourages his students to join him in research
5.0,M,hes so adorable take him he lectures a lot but theyre very interesting hes an excellent anthropologist and he always has amazing stories to share he gives a lot of assignments but you have the whole semester to do them his assignments are very simple easy a

1.0,W,i do not like professor larkin she is not helpful at all if a student ask for help ignores she is so rude and strict she does not care about students i have never seen these type of professor
5.0,M,a quip a minute as professor handschuh does his standup in front of the class but what you realize is how much you are learning about journalism photojournalism the business of journalism and the continuing need to keep up with the technology david truly cares about the students and be fortunate to get into his class
5.0,M,camilo is one of the best professors but he makes you work really hard his classes tend to be demanding and time consuming outsidemail of the classroom you will eat sleep and breatheven your work and it can always be better
3.0,M,he means well but the way he talks can be hard to understand also his theory is to say how much you suck ass with filming and then hopefully that motivates you to do better i have to say it worked for me
5.0,M,he is honestly the best professor i have ever had at dutchess been going to dutchess for two years and out of all he professors i have ever had he is my favorite he has a very thick accent but he makes fun of it himself so it is all out of fun he truly cares about your education and he wants you to do well absolutely amazing
5.0,M,camilo is the man if serious about learning all things film this is the man to learn from he will be tough on you and very straightforward but it is for your own good if you enjoy and take something from his classes then you are in the wrong field
5.0,M,camillo is easily the greatest communication teacher of all time period he will be hard on you but for your own good if you take camillo change your major because it gets no better than this
1.0,W,the worst math professor had in my life does not know how to teach most of the time she cant even figure out her own math problem that she created and she just looks at the problem all puzzled trying to figure it out when some students solve it first most of the time the students will solve the problem first
5.0,W,if you understand she will make sure to assist you after class she asks if we all understand before moving to the next chapter and gives a few papers to review at home she explains things very clearly

1.5,W,she makes you buy several books that you donvt even use she signs very english
3.5,W,teacher has a great attitude and is very helpful but many times is disorganized and assigns reading that you simply will not have time to do you must go to her and ask specifically what will be on the test because if you do all the readings she assigns you will literally have no other time for any other classes syllabus is sometimes a mess
4.0,W,april is wonderful and is one of my favorite teachers while some of her classes do require a good amount of work she is generally very clear about what is expected and is extremely helpful she makes most classes fun with her humor and positive attitude i am sitting in on some of her classes even though i need to take them
4.0,W,this is the thing her class is so easy that boring also if you are into meditating this is your class weird i know lectures are on the internet you take daily easy quizzes and work in teams for extra credit the tests are the study guide fanstatic and she cares but she is not for people that have no patience

5.0,M,hes really funny in a weird type of way if you take him see the work all that difficult and he is really lenient with when you turn it in as long as you email him explaining why you on the due date definitely going to try to take him for shows a lot of videos and you pretty much just write responses to them
4.0,M,this professor is really weird but in a good way he tells very corny jokes but you can tell he loves what he is teaching grades a bit tough but he will allow you to redo something for a better grade does not assign a ten page research paper i would definitely take him again great professor and very interesting topics and assignments
5.0,M,dr dukes is always available to help and shows genuine interest in your research topics he explains complex things in a clear way but you do have to pay attention so you know how to ask the right questions his notes are much more helpful than any textbook he assigns
5.0,W,dr classes are tough but you learn so much i have taken several both undergrad and graduate level you must do the reading most classes are discussion based she is incredibly supportive of your learning process i highly recommend her classes
1.0,W,this is the worst professor i have ever taken at this university is very monotone and hard to pay attention to her grading make any sense and is very unfair been trying to get her fired but unfortunately she done anything illegal
1.0,W,worst professor ever had one of the worst experiences of my life she like to teach or explain anything to you if you had a question or problem with a lecture she is completely useless i think she needs to retire from teaching because i felt very alone in this process and at times helpless when i was stuck on something never again
1.0,W,this was the worst course i have ever taken horrible experience this professor is beyond unhelpful when you get a problem wrong she explain wrong about it and just expects you to come up with the answer out of thin air after she respond to all your emails so it makes it very difficult to communicate with her stay away
1.0,W,take my word for it do not take her she is such a rude person care about her students thoroughly teach if you understand something too bad when you ask questions she will either laugh or not even acknowledge you i learned by asking other students not the arrogant professor please take her please please please
1.0,W,the worst teacher i have ever had when it comes to math she respond to questions and is rude when you ask a question she will simply ignore it the videos she posts are full of mistakes why do teachers teach anymore if they seem to not care about their students
1.0,W,she wrote this to the whole class i will point out where your mistakes are not what you must do to fix them it is your responsibility as part of the learning process to go over the lecture again then you should work the problems in the lecture and compare what you did with what is in the lecture what is the point of a professor then
4.0,M,he is a cool guy and he is a fair grader
4.0,M,great professor super nice he is the type of professor who cares more about learning than grade and actually means it he is a super caring guy and really wants to help students he has many great life stories to share and will not fail you as long as you show up and be respectful and try easy class and teaches a lot
2.0,M,hes a really smart guy no doubt about it but hes almost to smart to teach he looks at you like how do you not understand this if you can take a different teacher but if you cant just prep yourself and never answers emails almost forgot
1.5,M,he can be every unclear you wont get stuff back right away if you need help email him speak to him after class he says that attendance in mandatory but he sometimes forgets to even take it he really know our names even at the end
1.0,M,absolutely terrible teacher does not care about your grade or you he will never give back grades and will not follow what he wrote on the syllabus his powerpoint slides have nothing to do with the class and he will not prepare you for the tests if you have the book your screwed because your basically teaching yourself do not take
4.0,W,dr miller is awesome i hated chemistry in high school and after taking her class i hate chem as much she is so nice and willing to help if you ask her definitely take her if u need chem the class that hard just make sure you stay on top of the work homework on is due every week and test are frequent not too hard
4.5,W,she is really willing to work with anybody to get the grade that you want she is the most understanding prof i have ever met she will do anything you need to succeed in her class such a nice and kind human being
3.5,W,this class is pretty easy if you try for the tests if you know everything on the study guide she gives you then you will do well tests are not scantron but she gives half credit if you try to answer the questions
4.5,W,best professor ever she definitely expects you to work for your grade do the readings do the homework go to labs and class basically be a responsible adult like supposed to be at this age all there is to it go to her office hours she will go above and beyond to help if you show the initiative a
4.0,W,dr miller is awesome but her class is pretty hard you understand all of the material from just the because so difficult worth taking a half hour every other night to read the book what i did and i came out with a b also take advantage of her office hours she explains things better on

5.0,M,obvious that ian cares for his students wants them to learn real world techniques that might save their lives someday much more confident in my ability to protect myself since taking this course this was one of the very best classes taken as a college student i highly recommend this course this professor to everyone
5.0,M,mr kinder is an amazing teacher that cares about his students this is not an easy a class and you will have to work to acheieve an a i recommend ian and his class to anyone looking to take a self defense class fyi this is a very physical class so be prepared to sweat
5.0,M,bruce was wonderful not only did he teach me tons about meditation stress management and prevention he offered a wealth of other knowledge as well
1.0,M,i realize the course would include a mandatory mlm presentation by a snake oil salesman for a product based on inaccurate nutrition information from a veterinarian he pitches his other classes all the time and tries to bribe you to take them by offering extra credit in this course he treats adults like children and be late
2.0,M,class is relatively easy the book helps but its not needed as for the professor a hit or miss if late minutes to class only receive some credit for attendance graded on tests online homework assignments and attendance the tests are only questions each but worth points each he can be very unprofessional
5.0,M,amazing bowling instructor i a good bowler i made so many gutters until i took professor martin i never scored digits my entire life until i took his class now i rarely hit the gutter spares strikes are easier to achieve because of him learn to keep score he gives you the answers to the final exam on the first day
1.5,M,sorta feel like his main goal is too make me fail but he tricks you because he has a great personality but leave enough time to take notes
5.0,M,i have had him for classes now he is great pay attention in his classes and show up since he gives points for attendence i got a both times ive taken him love him
1.0,M,avoid his class at any cost he failed half of the class lectures are sleep provoking exams are tough he care about his students he assumes everybody has excellent knowledge in the subject just dont take his class
5.0,M,welp i had this guy for tutor and surprisingly the words never judge a book by its cover comes to mind although the tattoos and and mean face may deter you from talking to him he is actually one of the rare individuals who will talk to students as equals and also jokes around took him in mr and peter if reading this hold it pj
3.0,M,really not bad a bad professor he makes you work for it for sure but he teaches students about controversial topics that are interesting to write about the papers were cool to write about also just make sure to do all the online work readings and follow the instructions for your papers and do fine
3.5,M,cool and easy but beware he likes to bash students he will say your business in front of everyone assignments are pretty easy make sure you do his online work and your fine he grades on how much effort you put in in class work is nothing he will kick you out if you miss online work sooooo
5.0,M,i took his online class which was not easy there was a lot of reading and you have to be on top of everything it is easy to forget to do assignments when you are taking class online however prof conti made the work interesting he is not a piece of cake but he gives you the grade you deserve
4.5,M,reardon was fantastic lectures were super interesting and i learned a lot if you ask him he will help you and i even got to skip out on some assignments because i talked to him very easy class if you read the books and pay attention
5.0,M,communication skills are get back to you within minutes wrote a pg paper for his summer class on top of all of the work week course lots of work but nothing too hard to understand
2.5,M,i took his psychology class he is really not such a great teacher he is fun the class is somewhat enjoyable but he is completely unreasonable he is absent a lot and is a terrible grader it took me a little while to understand his system and what would be on the tests if you dont mind teaching yourself then the class that bad
5.0,M,he is so passionate about parasites and makes you get excited about them too a lot of memorization and on the tougher side but i would take this class again hands down he is really reasonable with his students and with his work load seriously a very interesting class with a really funny and passionate professor highly recommend him
4.5,M,dr richardson is easily my favorite professor at quinnipiac he has more compassion for his students than anyone i know and it was a pleasure to continually have him as a professor if you put in the work you will pass no problem but if you have a heavy course load i do not suggest taking him wonderful caring brilliant love him dearly
4.0,M,very passionate professor and very accomplished he expects the best out of students but beware of his extra times in labs counting fecal pellets he is very clear when he lectures but please please pleasee record him or write everything he says time consuming course but very rewarding i really look up to him and respect the man
5.0,W,dr wager is a great professor her expectations were clear and she really wants to help you succeed she was always entertaining and knew what she was talking about i took her hybrid course which i would definitely recommend
5.0,W,i love prof wager hilarious and dedicated i took this as the hybrid block and i loved it it is fast paced but not a ton of work the final is only a page paper and you can revise your essays as many times as you want she really wants you to do well and helps you as much as you can if i could take every class with her i would
5.0,W,taken as hybrid course it was good taking it with this teacher especially in a hybrid course she only assigns stuff that is needed be aware if you take this in a hybrid class there will be something due every time before the next class course work is easy if you are committed to it and turn it in on time peer reviews are not accepted late
2.0,W,overall she is a fine professor but there are a lot of little things like not very clear are sometimes weird do one peer review on time expect to get an a
3.0,M,i took his online class as an elective and regretted taking it by the end the information is interesting but he is a tough grader his tests were hard and very confusing
3.0,M,he gives quizzes that are hard to understand the midterm and the final are a joke the questions are twisted in such a way to just confuse you which i think is his main goal you will love the class and hate it at the end most of my classmates agreed with me on this good luck you will need it
1.0,M,he does not do a very good job of actually instructing if you meet with him during his how to schedule face-to-face meeting hours then screwed as far as learning more good luck actually learning how to do anything from him
1.0,M,he will give you a zero for even the smallest of errors does not answer questions or help just tells you to read the book his grading system is completely outrageous and the class is more about following his ever growing set of rules than learning to code not at all what i expected from an introductory coding class
1.0,M,although this professor sticks to his syllabus when grading his system is outrageous i was deducted points from the first assignment out of points possible idk how that makes sense of which was for a single incorrect output when my other six were correct gives no credit for correct lines of code only deducts for wrong ones
1.0,M,he answer questions and meet with students unless you submit your questions to him first over of the class has dropped out he has insulted students and grade fairly i told him i was having trouble on quizzes he told me to read the book he is an embarrassment for dmacc take his class
1.0,M,his use different fonts and is just a list of all of the things you allowed to do this class about learning to code about remembering his rules bother asking him for help he answer questions if you follow his rules on how to ask questions he will respond but he will not help you
1.0,M,missed the first assignment because i was moving did every assignment thereafter and he had me dropped at midterms for not attending does not give clear instructions and he seem to care at all about the students i get the impression he is one of those people that is miserable and wants everyone else to be miserable as well
4.0,W,pluss is hysterical and made comm research methods bearable there are no surprises here and the final is just the four quizzes she gave throughout the semester of those four she drops the lowest one there were assignments quizzes including the final the material can be dry but not on her she made a boring class fun take her
3.0,W,prof pluss is sweet and upbeat her quizzes are about questions however she does drop the lowest of the there is a group project and a final project easy a if you study for the quizzes
3.0,W,the most time consuming class ever taken she is a tough grader but very detailed in her feedback online class had total papers and endless online discussions i asked her a question about one of the papers and she was very rude about it admit i read the entire assignment but still she been nicer about it
4.0,W,i liked her her instructions were detailed and it was easy to do an assignment then look at the list and check them off she wrote up her own material which was easily printed off from canvas and her video lectures could be listened to on mobile app topics changed every wks but i promise you will learn so much do all extra credit
5.0,W,professor campos is the sweetest most easy professor had i was nervous to take spanish since i since hs she makes the content easy and really works with you if you miss anything but make sure to tell her ahead of time quizzes and exams are pretty easy as well i would love to take her for spanish ii if she ever teaches it again
5.0,W,awesome professor who cares about her students she understands that everyone comfortable speaking in front of people very tough grader though only class i get an a in be prepared to work
5.0,M,you show jc the effort and he will respect you back there is a lot of knowledge in his head and a genuine interest in the students once you demonstrate your commitment be freed to take your creations as far as you want to
5.0,W,she is a wonderful professor and you can tell that she is knowledgeable about history she makes the class interesting and i ended the class with an a with flying colors make sure to follow her essay prompts do the inquisitive and have the book open for the test she also gives bonus points so a plus great
3.0,W,class structure is great honestly just do the online homework exams and papers if you try to speak with her outside of office ours even if before or after class she talk to you and is quite rude about it feedback through e-mails are short and obviously rude lectures and powerpoints are very non-specific and all over the place
2.0,W,this professor is probably the worst history professor i have ever had her lectures are all over the place and carry little to no structure a straight a student and taking this class just for the credit so many people would send one friend to sign the attendance for them make this review the reason you sign up for her class
4.0,W,she is a very good professor funny and really knows what she is talking about be ready to write several papers with vague guidelines
4.0,W,i really enjoyed learning in this class mima is very knowledgable and presented course topics with amazing enthusiasm i think enjoy this course but i really liked the way it was taught she is very caring and will give you the results you want as long as you put in the effort she expects
3.0,W,mima is a classic lecturer she truly is passionate about her field she is rather dull though and does not get to know her students in tutorial we had to use name cards the entire semester of a tutorial of essay is extremely straightforward however the final exam should have been a take home memorize passages and detailed content
2.0,W,she cares about students tries to be helpful but sometimes she gives feedback the class is lecture-heavy for a practical class software engineering the lectures are kinda boring she often uses words which sometimes give the impression that she know what talking about or have real-life experience
4.0,W,not good at lecture makes material more confusing than needs to be she is very accessible and will work with you if she that you are trying which is her best quality on exams tends to put material that was briefly discussed
5.0,W,nancy would ask us to explain some phenomenon and we would always say shielding which was the correct but lazy answer in every case and she got wise and started requiring us to defend that answer since then never given an answer i defend in any medium on any topic instead of for defriending me on facebook
5.0,M,dr kent is very smart and he makes that very obvious his tests consists of a lot of critical thinking but he certainly gives you the tools to succeed he has weekly review sessions to go over essay questions and even gives extra credit for attending them i would take him again do or do not there is no try you have to put forth the effort
5.0,M,dr kent is a very helpful professor and is willing to help all the time his tests are hard but he gives you the material to do well on them he is very caring for his students and wants everyone to be successful i would take him again if i could work hard ask questions and go to review sessions and you will do great he is a great professor
5.0,M,dr kent is brilliant and passionate about teaching he tells his students every day if you understand please stop me he truly desires student success but you have to put in your part
5.0,M,great professor very intelligent and you will learn a lot if you put the time and effort into the class you will do well he is always willing to talk and help you out i would take his classes again
4.0,W,i had her for english and she was generally an okay teacher we mostly just talked about the book we had to read and most of the times we or she would go off on tangents not too many papers mostly just reading and class discussion
5.0,M,great solid professor people complain about the electronic journals but all he is asking you to do is write a response to a specific question he asks about the reading in sentences there are only electronic journals and two page papers in this class so its a breeze dr cherry is super knowledge and has tons of experience
2.0,M,a paragraph was due weekly grades were unclear until the end he looks for very small details in all of the stories read close reading is necessary
5.0,M,the most hilarious professor ever had and retiring soon trust me no matter what your major is you will not regret taking one of his classes
1.0,M,he is a very immature guy he believes he is always right even when he is not had to schedule with him but believes it is my fault even though i gave him at least two weeks notice he treats students as kids and not as adults
1.0,M,had him for intro to personality his lectures are unclear he goes off topic a lot it was hard to grasp much in his class superrrr boring he also makes you buy his his own books which is for both decent guy bad prof
4.0,M,dr khanal knows what talking about but he always the clearest about expressing that the assignments can have unclear directions a lot of the time but for most of the labs walk you through exactly what you need to do
2.0,M,a pretty tough grader and say that if he agrees with what saying do well grading is subjective anyways but he takes it to a new level personally i like him too much the material was pretty interesting on the other hand my ta this year was incredible though
4.0,M,i liked lecker his lectures were very interesting and depending on your ta the conferences can really help clarify things if need he has really insightful things to say about what we read very knowledgeable about the authors and encourages people to give their own ideas in class have the readings done before class its a must
2.0,M,do not recommend if you are not an engl major its a hard pass not approachable at all and puts himself before his students attendance is mandatory and participation is crucial in class online discussion boards and he keep track of how many times you post midterm and final both essays no other assignments tough grader
3.0,M,professor lecker is someone who clearly knows what he is talking about from a point of view if you are not an english major you will find yourself being utterly confused and frustrated in this class he very approachable nor does he try to aid the understanding when it comes to exams he is very vague
5.0,M,the tests can be difficult but he prepares you well via in class lectures he keeps the lectures engaging by constantly sharing anecdotes and telling jokes attendance is only of the grade but if you come to class be prepared to fail
4.0,M,great professor the key to getting a good grade in this class is really just paying attention to his lectures taking good notes and studying he makes all the neuroscience material understandable with the way he explains things he also always provides real-life examples relating to the lecture and enjoyable to listen to bc funny
5.0,M,one of the best professors at bc dr k is very knowledgeable in the subject of neuroscience the lectures are kind of stale but he has the best stories to tell which helps the material stick also hilarious yes his exams are difficult so you must keep up on your studying take him if you can
2.0,M,he is very knowledgeable in this subject however he has a hard time passing that on to his students i am currently sitting in this class completely lost
2.0,M,he reads his slides and posts them on cuny blackboard he gets his slides from the textbook but do not miss his class especially first years it really makes a difference going to his class no matter how boring he is
2.0,M,its very clear that knowledgeable about the subject but terrible at conveying that knowledge to his students lectures are unclear tests are tricky his notes are useless for studying and overall do not recommend
1.0,M,his exams are incredibly specific and unless you start studying weeks before the exam do not expect higher than a on any of his tests i rewrote the entire textbook and went to the learning center to review for his class i ended up getting an a but i worked for it he knows his exams are hard though so a bit more lenient with the gradin
5.0,M,such a gen he genuinely cares that you understand answer any questions some homework but fair and the lab helps you do it great really he knows what doing gives reviews
3.0,M,wouldnt retake this class with him hes good at teachin but for some reason some of the concepts were presented too difficult to remember throughout the course he does allow cheat sheets for exams but make them quick to understand b c it can slow you down make sure cheat sheets have examples of steps for specific problems rather than definitions
1.0,M,no clear enough he seems not understand the lecture
2.0,M,the subject material and the teaching style is boring but he does care about his students there are only homework assignments that add up to of your grade the rest is midterm and final he curved both the midterm and final by so many people were able to pass the class you would have to try hard to fail his course
2.0,M,am actually shocked at how high of a rating he has homework is due every week and is only worth of the grade while the tests are worst and are way harder than homework also very confusing to follow and he goes so fast not the best if you arent strong in math for sure
2.0,M,tests are near impossible to finish and account for most of grade does not grade on a curve only covers examples exactly as written in textbook the tests and quizzes are in a completely different format than homework alot of homework assigned for very little of grade most will struggle with him unless you already know subject well
5.0,M,best math teacher i have ever had he taught math is a way i could understand and always available for help had office hours before class i would stop in every morning to ask questions either on homework or take home quizzes helps you on quizzes or offers you to redo tests for credit builds relationships with students funny and is awesome
4.0,M,he will kick your butt and you will thank him for it our class went from students to less than by midterms read his powerpoints as he leaves clues as to what he will test on listen to his advice and study at least hours a week make your own study guides you have to put in the effort but he will work with you to help you succeed
5.0,W,love this professor a little disorganized but not too bad because super lenient on assignments and always very helpful so passionate about the material which really engages you she is the type of professor you will remember years down the road when you look back at your education take this professor learn a lot
3.0,M,geog online and it was a fair amount of work the problem is that his quizzes are not reflected by the material learned there would be a or mc that had a graded answer different from what the book said so that was not fair also he did not give feedback on why you got the grades you did on discussion posts and essay questions
3.0,M,this was my second class with prof cooke and i say he was much more organized than the first time prof cooke means well and is a nice guy but he just seems all over the place and not clear on his assignment requirements
3.0,W,dr griffin is a great person very funny and cares she barely teaches during lectures and your weekly work was online and would be due at weird times throughout the week she also had online quizzes and a couple extra credit papers at the end of the semester we had an apa research paper and a min vlog which was difficult very tough grader
3.0,W,for any english majors or if you want a challenge to improve your english she is a perfect match she is a tough grader very detailed at the end of semester she had us do a vlog and research paper about a leader based on leadership so start on time she is a great person can be reasonable if you talk with her on time
2.0,W,i did not understand her grading her lectures were poor so you learned nothing other than due a few office hours so pray god to catch her almost no extra credit till there was left from most of us are still failing good person though no teaching other than her leadership stuff you have to learn from cengage and leaders book
3.0,W,very goofy love her as a person but that matter she grades really tough and there are quizzes that are due in the middle of the day online like every week which she remind you about she cancel class but she will have another professor come in and sub for her
2.0,W,i took professor griffin online one her quizzes are confusing she would have one part of the question mimic the book and then the second half of the question she adds her twist to it second her writing assignments she wants both the written portion of a paper and a vlog lecture she wants u come up to the school for writing papers
5.0,W,she is a great teacher her classes are not easy but a nice way to challenge yourself she knows what she is talking about and she responds to your email rapidly beware she is very sassy and will roast the students who neither do the work or did it completely wrong from her instructions she gives a lot of grace
4.0,W,a good professor overall but if looking to do nothing and get an a not for you a tough grader but is there to help if you ask adamant about class participation so call everyone out at some point her class easy and only those who really want to learn will stay my class count went from to about
1.0,W,the most unreasonable professor i have ever taken she is extremely rude to her students and talks to them as if they are below her gives poor instructions and provide help responds to her students rudely and does not have a problem yelling at them very unprofessional she is in the wrong field if she is not passionate about teaching
4.0,W,ms lashun griffin is a really great teacher if you need help there to help you she does grade her papers tough but her comments and feedback would help you do better if you want to pass this course you cannot procrastinate on her class
5.0,W,professor griffin is a fantastic english teacher she is very caring and yes she is a tough grader but she literally gives you step by step instructions on what she is requiring from you the class is difficult if you procrastinate and do not stay on top of your game i am taking her for my english
5.0,M,dr kuhlman is the best teacher in the chemistry department students will fight to get his class during registration he is very helpful outside of class and explains his logic very clearly however he places a lot of class percentage on tests
4.0,W,intro to psych was easy she put her powerpoints online so skip class make sure to study notes and book bc she puts questions on the exams that we cover in class
5.0,W,kate care what anyone thinks and awesome she a feminist and buddhist with very strong political opinions she see for herself class discussions are always fun if you have a problem with other opinions take her classes
5.0,W,dr greene is an excellent professor she is very opiniated but she can defend every single one of her views with facts statistics etc also if you have a different view she will let you share with the class because she encourages debate she will not treat you any differently if you have a different opinion do your readings and you will pass
1.0,W,she lectures from a piece of paper does not write anything on the board most importantly she very rude and creates a hostile learning environment she do not care about any of your other classes because she makes it very clear that her class is more important than your others she is just very unprofessional
3.0,M,david is a good professor the best part of his classes are that there is no penalty for turning in late assignments and that attendance is optional but i would recommend going to his lectures for further information lots of readings and essays to write it was a good class
2.0,M,david is a really nice guy and does want you to do well but he is late just about everyday during his lectures he jumps all over the place and it is hard to follow boring the whole classes is writing papers there are small papers every week and both the mid-term and final are big papers very tough grader
5.0,M,david really cares about his students and their success he does require lots of reading but it is all very interesting if you love history you like this class he does have lots of papers but most of them are page papers he has options to do service learning or outside learning for extra credit and allows revisions of papers amazing teacher
5.0,M,very understanding and an overall great person he cares for the students thus he punish you for not attending class or turning in assignments late articles on used to take notes and write a short essay time consuming but very easy he does service learning so i got enough to skip writing a final paper oh yeah no exams
5.0,M,i loved class ancient history usually my thing but he found subjects that could spark students interest he is very supportive of his students and occasionally goes on little rants about how we are in charge of our education not the other way around and actually told us to come here to do research on our professors really great
4.0,M,i know why everyone else is complaining so much about this class it is a very easy a if you show up and do your homework you will pass he is a very easy grader if you have basic writing skills or just check your grammar with grammarly his class is incredibly boring though and there are daily quizzes very easy though
3.0,M,i had smith for freshmen composition he was a decent teacher but one thing i noticed was he didnt really care about the writing aspect of your paper as long as the grammar was near perfect you got an a also the quizzes he gives are stupid and basically re worded from the last quiz good thing they only make up also dont miss class
1.0,M,in my opinion he have a good way of teaching he always quizzes you on grammar he show any powerpoint or examples and most of the time he spends the class time talking about things that even related to anything in class he always releases you early one of those teachers that seem not to care
1.0,M,it seems that when it comes to papers this professor care much about the writing instead he cares more on the punctuation his quizzes are random and repeated his lectures relate much to actually english
5.0,M,smith is a very professor he is a decent english professor but he expects professionalism out of his students there are pop quizzes at least twice a week but they are always very easy do not get caught procrastinating on your papers because he catches small mistakes very easily
1.0,M,simply the worst professor ever had care for students gives little to no sympathy what so ever hard to talk to and just not a nice guy i recommend not taking this class he is a tough grader does meaningless quizzes
5.0,M,dr ian was one of the best professors ive had at eastern michigan i would recommend his section to everyone that wants to teach early education hes super relatable funny and has the most adorable british accent absolutely loved this guy
2.0,M,i had ian in a very large lecture hall from what others have told me he shines much better in the smaller classroom size because of the large size i did not enjoy his teaching style it was hard to hear him and i sat in the close half if you take him make sure it is is a smaller setting
5.0,M,had ian so many times lost count genuinely wonderful both as an educator and as a person each time had him been asked to examine literature in new and impactful ways respectful and interested in the opinions of his students you get away with not reading the books though so try it know highly recommend
4.0,M,he is a solid professor and has his teaching assistants do most of his work for him graded on a couple quizzes tests and papers lecture heavy but the slides that go with it are pretty informational so if you miss a class or two it kill your grade we read a lot but they also go in depth about the books
5.0,M,professor bracken does not deserve the bad rep he gets he is an amazing professor not a tough grader at all just realistic for a english class his lectures are very well organized and he provides good feedback on how to improve for your next essays
3.0,M,interesting class but super tough and dense material there was a ton of reading and most of it was difficult to get through a tough marker but fair and he interacts with the material really well not a gpa booster and avoid if you have an already heavy course-load
5.0,M,this class kept me going through the physics major he made it so fun and helped us all to understand so well he cares about his students so thoroughly and works so hard to help his students want to learn and succeed
5.0,M,dr bergeson is the best professor ever had goofy and eccentric and keeps his lectures entertaining and somehow learned almost all of the names of every student in each of his student classrooms he teaches the material simply and tests on what taught us in class nothing came as a surprise ever very accessible
5.0,M,definitely take physics from him he actually cares about the students and does everything he can to make sure you learn he also cares about your grade so he punish you for not knowing how to do everything and gives you several chances to learn the tests hard just study and do the homework and get a good grade
5.0,M,dr bergeson is a fantastic professor he is able to teach difficult subjects in a gripping way he cares about his students and knew a substantial amount by name in a class with students lectures are interesting and despite first appearance the vigorous testing and homework schedule is actually very manageable
5.0,M,i loved him he requires for an a but because his teaching style makes it so possible no curve he has short quizzes sometimes in groups rather than large tests a few short homeworks per week and iclicker questions in class that are participation-based does everything he knows how in order to help his students truly learn
4.0,M,professor bergeson is an entertaining lecturer and his class is set up to help you succeed at physics you will have to learn some of the material yourself as not everything is covered in lecture go to the ta lab if you are stuck
2.0,M,i clickers homework every night test every two weeks assigned readings that have nothing to do with physics besides justifying his teaching schedule but he is really passionate imagine vlad the impaler for gym trainer gonna get results but gonna but gonna hurt taking this class because you have to take vlad
2.0,M,relies completely on exam grades which can make the class really difficult get the textbook and look over anything he may have skimmed because it seems everything is fair game for his exams he teaches on very specific topics for such a broad course supposed to cover all of plant evolution
5.0,W,loved dr waterhouse so understanding and sweet she really wants us to do our best she made class interesting and always let us leave early as long as we finished the assignments given
5.0,W,i know why people are so bitter towards this prof actually great gave out in free bonus marks to basically everyone the midterm on the syllabus said chapters she made it easier by only covering chapters and i studied total hrs for midterm and got an a content on tests were directly from textbook and lectures
1.0,W,worst prof avoid her at all costs
1.0,W,would not recommend her modules are completely different from textbook material and very long to get through study the whole textbook yourself exam was not fair at all and she even write it she told us the format right before we took it and you have to pass the exam to pass the course horrible avoid at all costs
1.0,W,this is honestly the worst prof taken in university by far the laziest and irresponsible prof award goes to her minutes before the final exam she told the class things that were never on the online modules or the textbook the modules and textbook were not consistent at all can go on avoid this prof for your sake
1.0,W,had to read up to pages of boring travel pieces between every class and only had writing assignments no one in the class did all of the reading cause it was a ridiculous amount everyone did poorly on quizzes barely got any feedback on our few assignments horribly boring class not helpful at all still got an a good luck with her
1.0,M,this is by far one of my worst math teachers in my entire life does not explain many things on the tests loncapa is much more difficult than it should be since it does not give you the right answer when trying to teach the math to yourself i highly recommend not taking this class with him any other teacher is probably a better option
5.0,M,hes a thorough instructor if your a math or engineering major hes your guy if not like i am not then he is not your guy got an a but he defiantly makes you work for it will ensure you are prepared for future math classes
2.0,M,entire class consists of him doing examples he might briefly talk about the concept to introduce it homework is on loncapa which is the worst if you bring him the question do it for you though tests are alright if you review a good person but not the best teacher trig is hard and he really make it easier no book needed
4.0,M,abert is a genuinely nice person and shows enthusiasm he will only invest in you if he sees that you invest yourself in learning the material this is math people you are inevitably going to practice constantly in order to fully grasp what you are learning the hw problems ever too challenging if you do the hw the tests should be eazy
5.0,M,i love math easily my favorite subject this professor is very passionate and does an excellent job of explaining things not a fan of liberal arts math because i hate word problems he does an amazing job teaching and it was np for me attendance mandatory but i took it as express and if you skip you will easily fall behind
4.0,M,professor abert was an all around decent professor for calc he struggles in teaching you new material right off the bat and typically expects that you will have read the section being covered in class before hand he curve or drop lowest test grade but he is a very easy grader on tests and gives a lot of partial credit on problems
5.0,M,no comment he is awesome if not you are not doing what you have to do for a math class do not complain you teacher
3.0,M,he is very knowledgeable and explains the material well but his lecture can seem never-ending and his homework problems are a lot harder than the ones he goes over in class they are also very long some with questions but he gives you normally over a week to complete i would suggest taking mwf to have shorter lectures or else zone out
5.0,M,get ready to take notes he writes them all on the black boards and post anything online if you miss class you wont have any idea going on unless you go to his office hours
1.0,W,previously taken the online course to avoid the in class nonsense make a difference with her grading and lack of communication emails never the less jenni expects the most out of her students no excuses are tolerated read books in semester if you complete the book reviews you will fail honesty matter
5.0,W,expect to read novels during this course no textbook but she puts all relevant readings online for students expect to have to read an article and answer questions as homework for every class most of your grade comes from the extremely important book reports most class periods are spent gathering in a large circle and discussing as a class
1.0,W,im not sure if she knows this but not everyone who takes their class is majoring in history she requires a ridiculous amount of work for an introductory class i dropped her class within a week after i realized her attitude and extensive reading and other assignments and a school counselor advised me not to take her so dont even
1.0,W,do not take her i hated her class and dreaded going not only was it a waste of time but also a waste of money i learned nothing she never went over the class material she talked basically current events the whole time when this was a class about the expected to read chapter books on top of all the other articles she assigned
5.0,M,john burk is a great professor i failed business calc the first time but after taking him i actually started understanding he gives a good bit of homework but it all helps for the exams that he gives
5.0,M,very comfortable pace for a calc class he goes over several examples for each topic and leaves time at the end of class for questions very easy to reach to meet during office hours if trying to get into the school of business but struggle with calc the perfect teacher
5.0,M,he is a great person with so kind heart i am so thankful that i met a person like chef hersey and got a lot of things to learn
5.0,M,tim is a very hands on professor and loves it when you ask him questions on scientific ideas or topics in the world i had him for my flc and i would take any class as him as the professor the only thing is you have to read to books he assigns and watch the movies too
4.0,M,this sfi class was definitely my favorite course from my first year at ssu tim offers really interesting and inspiring points of view gives really awesome lectures and is working for the good of his students the class depends on the books films and short stories but its for sure fun and interesting if you put your mind and heart into it
2.0,M,ridiculously vague and biased there is no point in arguing with him if you disagree with him wrong he started off his first class with the statement more liberal than hillary clinton no relevance to the course but an accurate start to this class that is better off being called an hour and fifty minutes of opinions
5.0,M,make sure to do the story ideas do your beats as well buy the required book most of the coursework is ap style he cancels class to give students more time to work on the assignments
5.0,M,if you like fred or any of his classes then there is clearly something wrong with you this is the second time had him for a class and i have no complaints just do the work and you will get an easy a make sure you talk to him amount your assignments ask him about anything so he will know you truly care and be part of the east texan
1.0,M,i regretted taken class with him he is just horrible it is very hard to apply what he taught in class on exams not a fair grader coming to his class does not worth with bcos you can not apply what he teaches in class on exams and home work i will never advise anyone to take his class he will mess up your gpa his labs grading are worst
1.0,M,the worst class i have ever taken attend tutoring twice a week in addition to seeking outside help very condescending after asking to go over a homework question during the allotted time he responded by saying i believe you asked to go over that overall rude and not helpful at all
5.0,M,craig is my absolute favorite teacher of all time i have taken zoology and man environment with him and i am going on his field bio class to costa rica this winter zoology means a lot of memorizing but he gives a ton of extra credit on the tests and in the class in general so it is easy to do well man environment was the easiest class ever
5.0,M,craig really is awesome he gives a ton of extra credit and really does care about what he teaches it is seriously impossible to fail the class if you show up and do some extra credit take this class if you can he really is awesome i am taking one of his classes again next semester
5.0,M,craig is amazing a really cool guy and knows what talking about there are tests total which are hard but he gives over extra credit so like one bad test happen man environment so you do go out almost everyday but i loved it it was so fun and interactive great teacher passionate and cares
5.0,M,i took this class during the summer we went outside almost every single day to walk along the lake in the woods sometimes to do some very messy gross activities going to class outside earns you participation pts he is not very good at conveying material in class so you need to read the book to do well on exams there is lots of memorizing
5.0,M,craig is an awesome teacher you can really tell he is passionate about what he teaches also the class is a bit hard exams but there is so much extra credit you can still pass with a good grade you also do go outside a lot but a lot of fun this was my favorite class professor and i wish i could take it again
4.0,M,absolutely in love with his job and studies very enthusiastic about the subject matter and lots of opportunities to get hands on beware of skipping out on lab or classes though tests often cover material that is not in the textbook does give tons of points in the way of in-class activities
5.0,M,this is a great class to take for people with no previous experience he will help you get through every speech tests are so easy as long as you put in effort and show up youll be fine
5.0,M,one of the best professors i have ever had he gives good feedback has an upbeat personality and will help you out with any difficulties he makes his lectures interesting and puts you at ease when presenting a speech which especially helps for the anxious his study guides for tests are terrific and i highly recommend him
4.0,M,communications majors this is the one to take you will learn so much he is highly skilled and really cares about making you a better speaker best instructor hands down
5.0,M,he is a great teacher i love him
5.0,M,i love this teacher i took three semesters with him if i have any math class i will take with him with pleasure
5.0,M,klaas is a great prof i highly recommend if you have to take make sure your prof you can tell he really cares about his students i have nothing but respect for the guy make sure you attend lectures and do textbook exercises emphasis on textbook exercises a pretty fair marker and will let you know exactly what he wants
5.0,M,amazing prof one of the best i have had in a long time tries to connect everything to the students and encourages discussions in class really need the textbook because he posts all the topics in his ppt slides which is great readings are dry but if you go to the lectures you have to do the readings which is great
5.0,M,kraay is an amazing lecturer was a really interesting course i actually learned something from him however you really cannot skip class he post full ppts and he is a very tough grader even with my interest in the course i found it really hard to balance such a demanding elective
1.0,M,if you go to class you wont pass at all you cannot miss one class he leaves blanks in his power-points and you are only able to find the answers in class at the end of the class he does not re-post the power-points with the missing words so you are unable to study off of them if you miss a class and there is no textbook to look at dont
5.0,M,i was nervous because many reviews i read said the course gets difficult i find that it was difficult at all and not really a student that keeps up with work i never even opened my textbook and i always left class minutes early for my next one across campus you can tell he enjoys the topic and care about his students
5.0,M,amazing prof take ssh with him and golden
5.0,M,a great prof and person overall tests are always reasonable and to the point lectures were always interesting and he even uploads the audio of his lectures which is a great help to auditory listeners
5.0,M,klaas was a great prof critical thinking is an incredibly boring and slow course but you could tell he was passionate about it and really knew the material well pretty sure he played a role in writing the curriculum he posts the audio and powerpoint slides for every lecture on so you have to go to class overall a great class
4.0,W,i am not good at math and she made it very easy to understand i took this class online and her lectures are posted if you cant log on when shes on there is homework quizzes and poppers due every week but relatively easy if you follow along exams are taken at casa and easy as long as you study and do your work for the class
3.0,W,she can be a mess her online lectures are everywhere sometimes she forgets to record half the time and if not watching it live then good luck but the material was easy stuff you learned in high school so it a problem
2.0,W,there is a slight communication barrier with her speech which is manageable but her email etiquette is not very good she read your questions fully and answers only half of your questions if she even responds her lectures can be confusing because she gets lost her syllabus was very unorganized including the calendar
2.0,W,she makes a lot of mistakes when she does problems on the board so you have to correct her a lot it is also difficult to understand her the good thing is she does the math problems then posts them on her website so you can look over them later quizzes due every days even on saturdays and homework due every week poppers are a big thing
4.0,W,this class is really what you put into it the homework really helped if you at least try to do it before going to class it was a usual math class she would solve math problems with everyone and she will answer any question we had the class can be easy if you really do the homework
3.0,W,ms hafeez a bad professor but not going to spoon feed you if good in math and have good study habits i would say take her if not best to take someone else she goes pretty fast so it can be hard to understand going on i passed with an a but i studied my butt off her reviews help a ton for tests
2.0,W,she tends to be unorganized messy with her handwriting and unattentive to the blackboard chat when we as the students try to correct her it was to the point where i actually had to not go to her online class anymore because all she did was confuse me more than she taught me all in all i got an a by self-study and teaching
2.0,W,took this class as winter mini lectures were all over the place which made it difficult to follow overall do not take her an online class
5.0,W,currently in her class and so easy just pay attention to her notes do the practice tests poppers and quizzes and you should be of your grade from your practice test is added to the exam grade also if happy with your grade after the exams you have to take the final she is very sassy and sarcastic but i find it funny
3.0,W,ms hafeez seemed ill-prepared for class and normally just winged her teaching still as long as you do the homework quizzes and in-class poppers daily-work that she uses to check attendance than be fine this class is easy to pass as long as you do the necessary work
5.0,W,this is a review for her winter mini sesh stats first of all very engaging in her live lectures she cares a lot about her students often offering to meet w us at uh to help since this course is only a month long reasonable that she goes at fast pace so pay attention or self study a little tests quizzes and poppers
4.0,W,all her test are online stress they can be taken more than once
5.0,W,prof murray is very knowledgable and her lectures are really interesting heavier on readings but as long as you read them before the tests be fine very fair grading
5.0,W,one of the best professors had she not only wants you to pass but actually do well she allows you extra credit if she sees you put in effort her lectures are very interesting she is extremely it is so different from your other classes just by content very refreshing you will need the cd which is a bit expensive
5.0,W,linda is a fantastic english teacher she explains things clearly and openly she will be the first to tell you that the assignment is odd or might not seem worth while but she explains the why behind it she is open and honest when she gives feedback and really gives you keys to succeed
4.0,W,she was a good english professor there were times in her class where she loved talking about political and controversial things which too relevant to english but overall she stayed on track her grading for papers is very fair and she gives great feedback on how you can improve i would take her class again
5.0,W,i loved taking this class from linda she is great she was very understanding about everything i turned in a few assignments late and she mark me down for it all she really cares is that it is completed and that we did out best there are a lot of papers but she is willing to help you and accommodate
5.0,W,she is literally the best she wants her students to succeed and wants you to get the best grade possible in her class she does one on one conferences when it comes to midterms and your final paper and she do a finals test your last research paper is your final and you finish the class a week early definitely has been my favorite
4.0,W,professor shelton is not a teacher for the lazy or for the procrastinator she is willing to work with you and will talk to you about grades if you want to know why you got a certain score you will generally be writing a paper every week but as long as you keep up with homework you get bogged down
4.0,W,aurora is a really great lecturer the class was interesting and a delved into a variety of topics regarding modern media you have to do the readings though and show up to lecture most of the material on the quiz is stuff she lectures on do all the grading as another review said overall would take her again
1.0,M,doesnt understand students nowadays he expects too much he gave us our first exam the end of october and expected us to do well on chapters of studying
4.0,W,this class is really hard if you let it be you just have to pay attention in class do all the homework and class activities get on the tests and you will do fine dr chen is a cool lady and really relaxed she teaches really boring classes but does her best to help you learn the material
5.0,W,she is a great professor that will go out of her way to help you class is interesting however there are some concepts that are hard to grasp there really much homework at all other than reading the chapters from the book there are quizzes and a final but the final is just questions from the quizzes read go to class and take notes
4.0,W,a really great professor she knows her stuff you need to pay attention in class and seek help outside of class or you will fail the exams midterm and finals were both hands on final project used concepts from the entire semester the textbook is only used for studying so if you can borrow someones do that attendance is mandatory
4.0,W,the class is really tough due to lack of introductory material it jumps you right into the nitty gritty her tests are really hard but if you do well on the assignments and projects you are sure to get at least a b
4.0,M,dr b is pretty legit super easy going and there is no possible way to fail his class people have legit sat in class and listened to music during his lectures and still make on tests
1.0,M,this man is the absolute worst professor ever had the displeasure of interacting with arrogant begin to describe him weekly blog articles that are short essay length vague grading rubric he will not give you an a unless you stroke his oversized ego turn things in well before the due date or he will mark you down take it
4.0,W,professor spievak is super knowledgeable and cognitive psych is so interesting this class is definitely not for you if you dont enjoy reading articles writing essays or taking lecture notes without a powerpoint i personally did really well and liked her a lot as a person would take a class with her again
4.0,W,the way she structures her class is meaningful and makes sense with the subject you are expected to take the time to read all the materials she provides and take notes on everything for psych majors this class is important she is kind and funny and participating in class is easy to do and can be fun she expects you to do the work
2.0,M,my worst grade for a course so far in university i think the annoying overuse of textbook material that makes the class hard very frustrating when all of your marks come from exams based only on textbook material and there are no assignments or lab work his slideshow notes are terrible they contain only words and no explanations
5.0,M,i love ron cameron i take a class with him every year my favorite professor learned so much from him and i get that idiosyncratic but you will learn from him even if you like him but hilarious and crazy and great
2.0,W,if looking to take hall for sounding numbers avoid this class yes easy but learned absolutely nothing longest lectures ever and they make no sense she gives quizzes every thursday i personally hated this class because i had no interest in taking a music class you have to read her notes and she gives a crap ton of homework
3.0,M,man can he talk i would often find myself zoning out he mostly just reads directly from the book for the entire class period without showing any visuals or anything interesting one redeeming quality is that he is extremely funny and injects his humor throughout your entire grade is dependent on the two tests midterm and final grades
5.0,M,he is an excellent professor he knows the material he is teaching i enjoyed his class because he tried to connect the past and the current events he does his best to make the class interesting and also is very kind and tries always to help his students i only had midterm papers and final take him he is a very nice professor
4.0,W,a great teacher and knows her way around a piano you will need to practice if you want a good grade
5.0,W,she is a great professor she is pretty gracious but does expect a lot from her students i would take her again for aural in a heartbeat
3.0,W,she makes clear at the start she uses a flipped teaching style in that students teach students and she guides it is quite literally that and with it being an intro class no one has any clue what teaching you learn everything on your own she teaches nothing and occasionally shows videos she stresses she is lazy and she sure is
3.0,W,she really knows her stuff but her lecture slides very helpful offers extra credit quizzes a couple times throughout the semester so go to lectures
1.0,W,she is so politically biased that she will demean you in front of everyone if you have a different opinion even though she asked what your opinions are she also believes we need to get rid of math and science and focus on art trying to become a pa what does that mean about my job
5.0,W,very flamboyant fun and direct personality which i loved she is very serious about you taking the time to learn but learning a language is hard and she is preparing you to talk write and even sing in spanish attendance is extremely important and i would also recommend doing the extra credit which will help you towards the end to get an a
5.0,M,i am currently a junior student in his studio and i could not be more happy of the fact that he is my clarinet professor i was mediocre before i started my clarinet journey at wvu and now at a point i never thought i could reach yes he does have high standards and he can be harsh but it is to push you to aim high and improve
3.0,M,dr nelson was very passionate and loved engaging everyone on bi-weekly hikes what i did not like was his attitude and the grading scale he had good bad days and they were unpredictable grading wise genus and species identifying practicals and quizzes were weighted the same entire class was out of pts near impossible to get an a
5.0,M,really wants his students to do well lectures are long and wordy but you will do well if you go to class
5.0,M,i really enjoyed the material taught in this course meshaw truly wants his students to do well in the class and gives everything needed to get a good grade class attendance is imperative to get all the information covered in the homework and quizzes but if you show up have everything you need
5.0,M,vinnie is the best professor had by far his lectures were the most interesting ever sat in you can tell he really cares about his job and it shows in his energy the workload no homework really easy mc quizzes and two straightforward essays easy a if you go to lecture and actually listen and take notes
5.0,M,the hands down to the best professor ever had hope enjoying his retired life i miss you vinnie
5.0,W,like the happy helpful mom-ish teacher in a film does everything she can to help each student individually both with class projects and related outside projects wants you to succeed
5.0,W,the best professor in the whole college cares for your project and grade like her own more than a teacher she is a mentor
5.0,W,awesome teacher learned a lot from her
4.0,W,professor hays is a sweet lady but gets caught up with silly things like people having phones out or drinking something other than water she is a much better teacher than previous professors i have had for math concepts study for tests and memorize definitions as she is a tough grader and wants specific definitions
4.0,W,she is definitely moody for sure her class really that difficult just very strict like no food and phones on the table no talking whispering when talking attendance is mandatory be late the classwork and assignments is pretty easy
3.0,W,hays is a very serious professor as long as you eat or drink something other than water she will like you you should never use your phone in her class or she will call you out she lets you make up lost points for assignments as long as you turn them in on time make sure you come to class because edmodo is a large part of your grade
2.0,W,mediocre at best her classes can be fun and are very easy however her tests have nothing to do with lectures and she is very picky when it comes to testing and projects she can be pretty rude and allow food in the classroom aside of water she is sweet at times but can be pretty mean that second later overall i got a highly b
1.0,W,get ready to deal with an old moody lady with a bad temper she can be super sweet and nice once you turn around she is a completely different person she disrespects students like if they were year olds even think about skipping class
1.0,W,is very rude focus too much on irreverent things even teach she just reads off the handouts call you out if chewing gum or eating food which is very childish if another teacher teaching this class take it horrible teacher
3.0,W,class seems easy attendance and edmodo count a lot does not allow food gum cell phones nor drinks in the classroom not even if its a long period other than that class is not that bad her tests can be hard but if you look over the chapter and notes test should not be too hard she would send out a review for the test pretty helpful
4.0,M,prof harding is an amazing professor the content of the class was pretty tough and he did an amazing job teaching it to us be prepared to read and write there were about novels we had to read for this course show up and show him that you care and you will be fine
3.0,M,this class was alright but sometimes he was rude to students in class the papers were a challenge and the take home exams were no breeze i would not take him again
5.0,M,as an english major i absolutely adored dr harding his classes were intellectually stimulating and i always felt challenged to understand literature in a more in-depth way dr harding offers students the opportunity to revise papers gives students incredible feedback and makes his class very interactive
5.0,W,she is a wonderful professor fun and slapstick but is not someone to take advantage of she knows her stuff and she wants to help all her students learn and succeed with their writing goals
5.0,W,where to start annie is the best i honestly owe so much of my academic and personal growth to her she takes time both in class and out of class to make sure her students are okay and understand everything supportive fun amazing love her mentor teacher supporter speaks her mind and supports you for doing the same favorite prof ever
5.0,M,he is very easy going the class is not boring he helps you to get a good mark
5.0,M,amazing professor first day of class he said he has and it definitely shows he lecture word for word from the book but uses his real life experiences to teach us he is hilarious and kind super easy course and a joy to be taught by him if you have a chance take him
4.0,M,this guy is very interesting his lectures really helpful when it comes to the tests with that said he gives a lot of extra points during class so showing up is a good idea if you read the book an easy a he does have a tendency to drone on about himself but the stories are pretty funny and almost unbelievable
5.0,M,interesting i sure i would pass at first because his style of teaching is a lot different but as long as you read the chapters and go to class you will pass his lectures are awesome you will learn a lot about life brilliant man
5.0,M,he great definitely recommend test are easy
5.0,M,dr frank mitchell is hands down the best instructor ever had the pleasure of learning from he is kind and intelligent and he cares about his students and is more than willing to make himself available and approachable he explains the material in a way that is understandable i plan on taking more of his classes in the future love him
5.0,M,kwag is a very knowledgable professor his lectures are always interesting and if you are willing to work and participate in the class you can learn a lot and do very well he genuinely wants students to succeed although he may be strict at times he is always available for help
1.0,W,i would not take again she can be rude and snobby very opinionated and vocal about it she gets too dramatic in her lectures made me want to fall asleep her tests were so unorganized it was so frustrating knows a lot of information but lacks substance doesnt reply to emails when she does its vague takes long to grade assignments
5.0,M,jim is a really good professor hes clear and takes the extra time to help you he hates when people are late and or miss alot of class as long as you really make an effort hell teach you as much as you want to learn perspective drawing was tough and very precision heavy better if youve taken drawing beforehand
3.0,M,easy class attendance mandatory you buy the book read it and do the online assignments if you want to actually learn take another class if you want an easy a take this class he also keep you for the full hours of the class
1.0,M,he started the class days after the short semester started very unclear with instructions and respond to emails not involved with the class and the program is what will be teaching you and grading your work the program is extremely specific in how it wants you to answer questions which is extremely frustrating
5.0,W,a wonderful professor i learned so much from her does have a lot of homework but to be expected given a language class
4.0,M,no longer teaching professror emeritus laid a good foundation for future teachers to model his clarity of thought and instruction has helped me in my upper level courses master teacher
5.0,M,dr velleman and though i took his class nearly years ago provides a good structural framework for how to approach statistical analysis in general it helps develop a sense of how it should be done listen to this brilliant man it will do you good the class i took years ago had a different code so this is my best guess what it is now
4.0,M,sounds like someone who did not pass the course last spring semester got on and tried to repeatedly slam him he did not even teach the fall
4.0,M,professor corvino is fantastic he is funny and caring this class consisted of a lot of reading and only exams so come to every class and study hard for the exams
5.0,M,good guy and some funny jokes during his lectures took him for and it was an easy a
3.0,M,professor knudsen is one of the most experienced and brilliant faculty in the iu geography department perhaps in the entire university his research spans many many sub-fields of the discipline he teaches courses on food geography and theory however the courses i took with him involved industrial and economic geography he is versatile
3.0,W,explanations are not her thing but over all easy class if you do the assignements properly easy a because her final is basicly questions from the book
5.0,W,dr duma is one of the best lecturers in math she explains in a way that makes it very clear what we need to know and what we her examples in class reflect directly what is going to be on the and finals she grades very fairly and is very kind i would take her again
4.0,W,not the worst teacher but certainly not the best she is lazy in class and skips a lot steps which can lead to confusion might be a language barrier thing but she almost seems condescending when answering in-class questions her teaching style is to show you the process rather than the theory which is not always ideal not a teacher for everyone
4.0,W,duma will be a good fit for you if good at self-teaching her are made up of difficult textbook problems and are doable even without consistent class attendance would recommend
4.0,W,i found this professor really inspiring poetry is a difficult subject and she handled it beautifully
5.0,W,i absolutely loved her her lectures were interesting and i actually enjoyed going to class the down side is that there are quite a lot of papers assigned throughout the semester however she does a good job with feedback in order to improve your grade i did find that she can be a tough grader but if you put in effort do fine i got an a
5.0,W,she is willing to work with you and helps you the class is paper based and make sure to do them and use the criticism to improve your writing
4.0,M,personally loved this class low key funny so not that boring he tells you exactly whats on the test if you go to class buy or read the textbook buy his little brown book instead study his powerpoints and that book and the stuff he says in class and not that hard if you pay attention in class might call you
5.0,M,dr brooks is an amazing teacher i had him for biodiversity and i learn so much and his lectures were never boring he actually teaches yet you have to put on your part to do well in class
4.0,M,i took brooks for as well same textbook that i never opened read the ppts take notes on what he lectures go to classes and study for iclicker quizzes they are pop quizzes not scheduled exams often have a few freebies but they are very long study well
3.0,M,he was very accessible always gave feedback and answered very fast i took this course online so not sure how entertaining he is but i did not have a problem with this course even though it was my first online course you have to submit online discussions every single week grading for all assignments is clear

5.0,W,love her best teacher at vol state by far
5.0,W,i would retake this course a million times tops explains everything very well and is always making us laugh she is willing to work with you if your grade is struggling which is unlikely and is almost always available outside of the classroom
5.0,W,top is an amazing teacher she tells hilarious personal stories to give you memory aids her tests are straight from the notes she is very reasonable and i wish i could take her again
5.0,W,topping is an amazing professor she is full of hilarious stories and will make you laugh every class she is super kind and easy to talk to i am taking her courses again this fall

5.0,W,take this class professor top wants you to do well in her class and she makes it very easy to do so she makes the material easy to understand and provides real life examples
5.0,M,one of the nicest profs i have ever had very approachable outside of class and will work with you to help get the grades you want you definitely have to read so being lazy wont cut it all grades are essays which isnt too bad because he gives the questions a week ahead of time and goes through them in class lectures can be random but worth it
5.0,M,if you havent took sph this is the professor you need in your life professor betts is super funny but very professional he creates such a comforting environment in his class that makes it so much easier for speech days he tells you want he expects gives clear instructions for every speech group speech and also for the tests
5.0,M,i was always so scared of public speaking but bob betts creates a classroom environment that takes away that anxiety he grades on content not nervous ticks or memorization super enjoyable class with fun assignments i would recommend to anyone taking a speech class
5.0,M,took this last year but he was a very nice professor he was very helpful and if you do exactly as he instructed and follow his outline then youll be fine i was very anxious to take a public speaking class but i left the class becoming more confident in public speaking would recommend research matters a lot
1.0,M,this professor made too many mistakes in his grading he was also was very unprofessional about it because he did not care to fix the grades unless you chased him down
5.0,M,best one i have ever had speech is hard you have to practice regardless of the professor but if you do what he says each speech you write he checks on each person individually in class if you do exactly what he says when he gives you individual help and you practice you will pass easy hes really smart so just do what he says
4.0,M,professor betts managed to make my first year of speech enjoyable rather than stressful and nerve-racking he provided you with plenty of notice and instructions before each assigned speech he also did not require anyone to memorize their speech his focus is more on content and participation matters significantly in his class
4.0,M,research is key to good grade make sure to show up be on time and take notes as best you can he loves class participation and questions and is very accessible via email and office hours he assign much in textbook but if you take the time to read the related chapters you will have a solid advantage
5.0,M,dr damen is amazingly helpful and by far one of my favorite professors the content of the class was brutal but he has a way of making it tolerable incredibly motivating and his comedy is stress relieving
5.0,M,best professor at depaul this professor really cares about his students he gives a couple of essays for the quarter but makes it really easy to pass you redo any assignment until you receive full credit i enjoyed every minute of this class and it was a night class so happy i took him
5.0,M,i would highly recommend for anyone to take him yes the class is easy and its hard to fail his lectures were very interesting especially for a religion class and he is very understanding
5.0,M,professor karpinksi is awesome most amazing person i have ever met there are two reflection papers one page each and three papers he does an amazing job at explaining the material he give you extra time to complete the papers take him best religion teacher ever keep up the great work professor chili pepper approved
5.0,M,professor k is an angel from above he is such an intelligent man he does assign a lot of papers but worth it because you actually learn the readings are interesting and so are his lectures he engages everyone to participate and keeps an open mind during discussions keep up the great work your chili pepper you deserve it
5.0,M,i loved taking acct and with prof janicek he really does care about his students and wants to see them do well he use hw as a grade nor does he grade it but goes over it in class he took grades for each of the classes midterm final and a case study he does give extra credit to use on the test which is super helpful
2.0,M,he is a very kind man and is willing to set aside fridays for study groups if you are available his teaching is mediocre and students correct his problems at least times a day so watch out for his work his tests are medium-challenging and must do homework to understand them the exam is extremely difficult so better do good on those tests
1.0,M,terrible teacher cannot get a full thought out will tell you incorrect information and even if you are correct will tell you that he is correct does not understand electronics and makes you do the class on the computer without any clue as to how to do it makes you buy a book for and let you use it
1.0,M,he was horrible the first week he confused everyone and sometimes just seem to know what he is talking about he tells stories that have nothing to do with class he is the worse do not take his class
4.0,M,professor conrad is a very fair grader and certainly wants his students to understand the material he had multiple study sessions outside of class there is a lot of out of class work that he assigns however it really helps you understand each and every topic
1.0,M,awful i had him as a professor for college algebra while i was still in high school whenever anyone asked him a question he hardly ever answered the question being asked when he would try to show someone how to work out a problem he would get it wrong i basically had to teach myself
4.0,W,mrs johnson is an all around decent professor i am not good at math whatsoever so i have trouble in her class however she is understanding do not miss her class if you have to trust me you will regret it she is pretty good at explaining things and will help you further i have anything bad to say about her
2.0,W,in her probability and statistics class she does not explain things well at all she did not show us how to use statcrunch bc we use it on tests it was made for online hw so online hw takes hours she does not drop lowest grade or provide extra credit so if you understand her complex teaching you are screwed
4.0,W,dr sowell is great and she knows what shes doing but i feel she could work on her teaching skills she moves very fast and sometimes dosent show every step of the problem for someone who is a bio major and not math inclined this can prove hard she has really strengthed my math skills though take her shes great youll just have to work hard
5.0,W,i really enjoyed dr class she is there to help her students and cares about how you do in the class you have homework every night and tests are weighted heavy but if you do the homework you should to good on tests i would recommend her
5.0,W,ms fenton is cool she does not count attendance as a grade but she notices if students are not present so do not skip class take her class she will call on you to answer questions in class so be prepared to speak when called upon oh show all of your work on tests memorize all formulas early in the semester she cares
4.0,M,i took dr online psychology course he is a tough grader and you must turn everything in on time he does not respond to emails right away however if you email him he will answer any questions or concerns you may have you must participate in discussions or you will fail this class is very fast paced but interesting
3.0,W,i took her online development psychology course it was kind of hard to stay on top of the assignments she would make a lot of things due on one day about a month ahead of time and let the students do it as they pleased some may like this approach but i found it difficult to remember to do assignments until the last minute
1.0,M,i took professor general psych class online for a filler class worst professor had in years takes a long time to respond and very tough grader with no response for help take his class again not online at least
4.0,M,so glad i read his reviews before i started work in his class if you take him make sure you are detailed with the module questions i mean pages per module and only use his links to answer the questions he gives unlimited attempts on tests so take advantage be active with discussions too class is a lot of work but learn a lot
5.0,W,thought this class was easy as long as you go to class just the paper and the presentation is your grades she literally tells you exactly what to put in the paper if you go to class gotten an a but i used an outline during the presentation
5.0,W,definitely one of my favorite classes while i was at vol state she made the class very fun to learn in she is very cool and was very understanding about me having a class at another school you be shy or embarrassed in her class because use her psychology on you but if you get the chance to take her take her she is really cool
1.0,W,there is a good amount of homework although if you read up be fine she teach much in class mostly youtube videos and she jumps from slide to slide without explaining how they relate to another tests are ridiculously hard and confusing half of the content has never been gone over or even mensioned in for a ride
1.0,W,she literally will not teach you anything if you are a comp sci major i hope you already know how to use java if you are taking it for credits even think about taking this excuse for a professor you will fail if you think you did all the homework right which you probably did she will still give you
2.0,W,lecture with errors and youtube channels are of the material covered in class unless the students are engaged she tends to move clearly knowledgeable in the subject but not the clearest on answering questions and a little hostile in answering questions even though she encourages them
1.0,W,tough grader she expects too much for an introduction class lots of homework no extra credit
4.0,W,good instructor a grading criteria is given for each assignment but does not display how picky she is so be sure to be very precise when assembling your homework folders gives detailed feedback very caring encourages questions lectures are slightly confusing but she spends quite some time clarifying things with you if you ask for help
5.0,M,i took this class these past weeks in the fall of and i thought it was going to consists a lot more work like people were saying honestly i learned a lot from the labs we were assigned and he strongly believes in all students there is nothing that be possible in this class i would highly recommend him to anyone thanks again
5.0,M,awesome course and i am very glad i took it if you are decided on him and another teacher take him this is a perfect ge course for life science if you are not a science major there are about quizzes discussion current event assignment a midterm and a final it sounds like a lot but it really
4.0,M,i hardly used the textbook and still ended up with an a he sets you up to excel and for us non-science majors it is much appreciated i definitely recommend this professor
3.0,M,the tests are word for word the practice test they are the exact same thing just memorize it lectures are boring and he makes a lot of mistakes on the board you can snooze through lecture be there for the quizzes and memorize the practice test and be fine very boring
4.0,M,dr g is fantastic he makes you feel validated and respected as a student he never talks down to anyone he keeps his lecturing as interesting as possible still theory and tries to engage students in the discussion you can tell he puts his heart into his work and really wants to connect with the students take him
4.0,M,dr g is hilarious he likes to tell personal stories which helps you remember the material the lectures can get long and boring but because the class is an hour and a half there are only three exams total all of which are online there are also two projects the only downfall to this is that you lose more than points for an a
5.0,M,although the lectures get long i found the content boring rather than the professor i loved having him he made things personal with stories which helped me remember certain info and why things happened the way they did critical to sociology he thrives off of bantering with students and their participation would definitely recommend
5.0,M,dr g is the man i took this course online over j-term but he was still very helpful read the instructions and do exactly what he is asking for and it is an easy a
5.0,M,i took several of mitchell snays courses in and and still remember many of his lectures hands down the best teacher i had in my life challenging and passionate he made my love of history endure
4.0,W,ive never met anyone who understands acting the way elizabeth does she just knows how to make you better at public speaking acting-related stuff in particular i really like her emphasis on differentiating between actor and script she made me feel welcome among a bunch of hostile theater majors even though i was not as
2.0,W,i am currently in her class she is not helpful is impatient with questions arrogant and basically expects you to know spss z-scores t-test prior to being in her class she does not go over new concepts her homework is very hard no time on class to go over it and balks at questions two words extra credit she is arrogant and rude
5.0,M,mr filson is hands down the best instructor i have encountered at grcc he goes above and beyond his duty and comes to class earily often it is not a easy class but if you put in the hard work ask he is always glad and eager to answer and attend class you should do well and even if you dont you will learn to love his class
5.0,M,dr filson is a wonderful professor i came away with an unexpected tremendous amount of knowledge about the earth a tough subject that he makes fun and interesting and pretty forgiving in his grading do the reading and study guides show up to class do well i highly recommend him and love to take another class of his
5.0,M,best cs prof had at mcgill lectures are extremely clear and concise and prakash really cares about his students doing well he has stayed well past his office hours to help students in the past
5.0,M,he really has the right way to teach his presentation of the material is simply efficient i could understand everything the first time the assignments and exams implied more thinking than actual writing and were sometimes challenging but always rewarding
5.0,M,legit wizard people find comp hard because quite foreign but prakash is a wizard at teaching this stuff going to his class was an actual treat take any class that teaching about half the class was done the final within an hour
5.0,M,is an extremely hard class regardless of the teacher but prof mann was great not very enthusiastic but he tells you exactly what you need to know through his powerpoints all memorization you definitely have to study your butt of but as long as you do that you should do fine note cards are a must only used my book to study
5.0,M,this class is so much fun dr espey wants you to learn which is or supposed to be the point of college he often tells stories and makes lessons easily relatable to real life scenarios marketing is an interesting field and he makes it more interesting listen to people who tell you not to take him you will learn so much
5.0,M,best class ever i enjoyed the way professor jasek-rysdahl taught the class he made economics easy to understand if you pay attention and do the study guide then you have trouble passing the exams
4.0,M,his class was really great his lectures were really interesting and he used recent events so you can relate if you do all the homework and do alright on the test then pass the homework is extremely easy attendance mandatory but you do group work in class somewhat often
3.0,M,lectures are basically the reading assignments regurgitated sometimes add a few videos fun facts and personal stories to make them not too boring his quizzes too hard but his tests can be tricky he offers a lot of extra credit questions and makes his own memes though
1.0,W,her tests cover a lot of material and she allows no additional resources those who have a good understanding of algebra would probably do okay in this class but if you struggled with algebra at all in high school do not take her online i have done fine in the other math courses i have taken but this class was too much i work full-time
5.0,M,if you need to take patho then i highly recommend professor lombrana i taken a course in person in a long time and never cared for them but lombrana have a way of effectively teaching he literally holds your hand and walk you through the material he makes time to be there for you and genuinely cares that you pass and will help you
5.0,W,she talks a lot and most of the time after classes you will wonder why you even went her class is very easy and laid back and i never got anything less than a b attendance is not mandatory and she cancels class a lot of the time
1.0,W,reynolds does not lecture and give clear lessons about how to write effectively or interpret the literature she assigns this is a self-study class you must learn on your own assignments are vague and unclear you only learn what she wants after she returns your work very hard grader learned little about writing in this class avoid
1.0,W,unreasonable professor too meticulous if looking to take a class where graded according to your performance this the class for you she has a set grading criteria on paper but fails to follow it herself at times i highly recommend not taking her class
1.0,W,shes honestly the worst teacher ive ever had she grades poorly shes rude if you dont do something its basically the end of the world for her im currently in the class and shes nothing but rude and disrespectful to each student just sat outside the classroom with a few students and we all agreed shes the worst teacher here
5.0,M,dr bob is one of the best professors out there his lectures are very interesting and you can always relate to them he always tells stories that are fun to listen to as long as you are doing your studying do great on quizzes and exams
5.0,M,my favorite professor at highline he cares more about the students actually getting and understanding the information he gives feedback on all returned papers and he always has them graded within two days really cares about his students
5.0,M,he is sooooo cool but this class is not easy on exams definitely a good professor with passion but be ready for the reading
5.0,M,i took dr class because all of his amazing reviews and he is now easily my favorite professor ever had he is so knowledgable and this was one of those classes you will never forget he has the best stories and his lectures are amazing tests are a little long few short answer questions but as long as you take notes be fine
5.0,M,i enjoyed dr bob a lot since he made his lectures engaging he also sets up the classroom for you to interact peers if you need to take this course for credit i definitely recommend him take good be all the material you need on exams use notecards go thru the book and remember key definitions he gives bonus
5.0,M,best class taken at highline i got to know everybody he made us memorize name to do class discussions gives many extra cred so be sure to do them all might seem like matter but trust me it adds up returns tests next day he believes you should get feedback asap read book study take dr bob no regrets
5.0,M,one of the best professors i had at highline so good at what he does one of those classes you will remember for a lifetime
1.0,W,omg worst prof ever had she literally talks in riddles and there is so much reading and theyre difficult she pins you into going to lecture cause participation is and other papers plus final i literally can never follow her at all avoid pretty much my entire class dreaded her and the material
1.0,W,oh my god this has probably been my worst experience ever as a student she rambled on and on n on during lectures about topics just barely related to the material i tried to take notes but honestly there was no point there are wayyy too many readings to stay caught up on and quite lengthy tests are on all readings not worth it avoid
2.0,W,you have a lot of readings every week the midterms final and papers are based on these readings she repeats what is important in lecture so you miss it participation in discussion is a must for points go to the ta for help on the papers it makes a huge difference i went from a c paper to b after meeting w the ta
2.0,W,she is passionate but style of instruction and evaluation is not reasonable no ppt substantial readings mcq can be ridiculously tricky and the ambiguous wording remind me of sat in discussion you have to talk to get the points the evaluation of paper totally depends on your ta which could be subjective remember you have other ge options
5.0,M,dr andy is super passionate about his classes and ucd not for everyone but i personally enjoyed his class his essay prompts and grading criteria ambiguous or unreasonable participation and attendance count he makes that clear from day one if content to not show or show up with a disengaged attitude find a different class
3.0,M,half of class was spent with him humble bragging about how marvelous himself and his achievements are and the other half was spent with him explaining his unclear prompts in the most obscure way possible a tough grader with high expectations so to office hours and get feedback on drafts before turning in your final paper and you should do ok
5.0,W,the exams are not cupcakes yet dr donaghy gives many opportunities and resources to preform adequately she is lecture heavy and fails to project her quiet voice very well but i love her class sit near the front take decent notes and read through the chapter vocab and make an a or b
4.0,M,absolutely the most caring and knowledgeable professor i have ever had boy does he know how to teach
4.0,W,i feel that she really knows what she is talking about and therefore manages to explain the subjects very well she is helpful and makes sure that everybody understands the topic yet one does not feel stressed or pushed
5.0,W,she is amazing professor her explanation is so clear and so easy for understanding so you can forget about math problems that you had before moreover she has warm heart and she is very kind professor
2.0,M,mixed feelings excellent at teaching the material learned tons but tests are very specific and a total time crunch will to some extent be penalized if you do not think along the exact lines that he wants you to i recommend if you want to learn but not if you are concerned about your grade
2.0,M,his lectures are awful go on these long rants about random things and half the time you know what he is even talking about his tests are heavy on material very tough to study for the one thing i did like about the class is the analysis paper we wrote
4.0,M,i overall enjoyed class however he is pretty disorganized at times he does drone on often like people say but i really appreciate how passionate he is about what hes talking about hes flexible with late papers but hes also a tough grader people complain about him being boring but hes a really nice professor and an invested guy
4.0,M,yes a bit of a low talker it help that he leaves the door open but i found him to be very nice and helpful with regards to assignments some of the lectures tended to drag a little from time to time but he did a good job of laying out the structure of the course as well as explaining his expectations for our papers and exams
3.0,W,if you are a beware to hear some controversial things pretty straight forward on what she wants from you your grade is based on book quizzes and film quizzes a nice and caring person but can sometimes inject her opinion too much everything is basically online except the midterm and final
4.0,M,a good lecturer if not a bit arrogant the kind of professor you hate to have while you have him but will be grateful for after you leave him however only recommend his class if going to being using chemistry in future courses it was a lot of effort and very stressful
1.0,M,this guy is awful he insults people in class and makes a fuss if anyone asks him to work a problem has clicker questions every class period and only gives half credit to wrong answers even though an attendance grade tests were ridiculously difficult and he never curved even though test averages were in the rudest prof ever had
2.0,M,if you ask a question in class there is a big chance he will condescend to you in front of everyone and you will never ask another question again you go through the homework and feel like you will do well just to bomb tests part of why the tests are so awful is because he provide any formulas or constants unlike every other professor
1.0,M,avoid if possible he is very smart he knows it often being rude to students in class and answering questions with other questions if you taken ap chem he is not the prof for you his hw impossible if you start ahead of time but i study understand the material attend every class and still do badly on his tests
5.0,M,dr bakker is as good of a chemistry teacher as it gets honestly he uploads class lectures and does a great job explaining the math side of the class which is normally where chemistry teachers struggle alot of people have dropped or have bad grades but this isnt an easy class but if you put in effort you will do fine highly recommend
4.0,M,dr bakker gets a lot of negative reviews but i absolutely loved him he can be a bit condescending if you ask stupid questions but do the reading and an easy a he teaches straight from the textbook so i recommend reading ahead of time then going to lecture to clear up anything that confused on
1.0,M,make sure you do as many practice problems as you can to prepare for the test the test will be much harder then other classes so study and put in the hours there is no clear grading criteria even though he says there is in the syllabus i still have no idea what my final numeric grade was take a different professor if at all possible
1.0,M,take another teacher do problems in class make sarcastic comments about how much faster he can do them tests much harder with trick questions than other sections u get to use formula sheet on final you might learn more in his class but you are unlikely to get in a unless had ap chem and grading criteria not clear
3.0,M,dr bakker is a very tough teacher but he knows what he is talking about and will prepare you well for future classes if you put the work in all the basics for the tests are in the powerpoints but in order to do well you need to do a lot of practice problems definitely take if just taking for a science elective
1.0,M,dr class was very difficult and not to be taken lightly during class he tries to be funny but often goes over as rude and demeaning he has many times worked a problem out on the board and not explained where he gets the numbers from he seems like a brilliant man but not very good at teaching i recommend taking him
4.0,M,he is very condescending drops your lowest test grade expects a lot out of his students and the ones who try come out with an incredible amount of knowledge
3.0,M,i had dr bakker for both and and it was one of the hardest classes i have ever had to take he expects a lot and pushes his students to the limit i hated his class and thought it was very hard but i learned a lot more than other students with other teachers which will and has helped me with other classes
2.0,M,gives lectures mostly on concepts and theory with very few example problems and expects you to learn how to do most problems on your own he does clicker questions for a grade every class i would not recommend him to anyone who does not have a strong chemistry background he also gives no equation sheets for exams
2.0,M,while he does not give as much homework as some of the other professors he likes to assign it on a very short deadline finish the chapter on monday homework is pushed up to be due that wednesday attendance was required as he gave in class clicker questions everyday that count as participation but also are graded kinda sassy guy
5.0,W,mrs zrolka is the best if you come to class take notes and pay attention you have a problem if really struggling she is always in her office ready to help but you have to put in the work if not a strong test taker or have a hard time grasping the material then you need to be her best friend but she will help you
4.0,W,i would highly recommend taking dr carnes and getting on her good side she favorites students but if you participate in class and make an effort do fine tests hard make sure you study the study guide and you will be fine her personality makes class enjoyable and a fun learning environment
4.0,M,midkiff is a really nice guy and make the class unnecessarily hard he goes off on tangents sometimes but they are related to the material and he has cool stories to tell make sure you study the lecture notes and examples for the tests
3.0,M,a great guy but its hard to learn thermo from him goes off on too many tangents figured out after the test that i could not go to class and still make the same grades im sure going to class helped a little more but just as fine studying old tests you get a note sheet every test tests with lowest dropped and a final
4.0,M,he is the head of me department he has been teaching thermo for years his lectures can be dull and put you to sleep he goes off topic a lot with his stories homework is not due till end of semester but keep up to do well on tests the redeeming value is his tests are easy and curves very generously
4.0,M,good guy just kind of has dull lectures worth going to class though when attendance drops he will announce a pop quiz your question will usually be please recall your name and you turn in your name very lenient with homework as well
1.0,M,statics with haque was very difficult he did examples during class and assigned homework every night even if we finish the examples in class sometimes the homework and class notes seemed completely unrelated tests are of your grade and he curve
2.0,M,his lectures are not very helpful with his poor handwriting and angry demeanor he was not very helpful during office hours he posts online notes that are typed and easier to follow along he does offer good review before each tests to give an idea of what will be on tests lots of homework but only worth of grade
1.0,M,professor sharif is unintelligible his accent is atrocious and he speaks as though he has a mouth full of marbles and his handwriting is somehow worse he writes both his and as you would a gamma which come up a lot in dynamics he capable of doing his own problems in class and made the test the day after the drop date
4.0,M,professor sharif teaches fluids in a very straightforward way he holds review sessions before exams that are very similar to the exam itself homework is due every class but is only worth of the final grade so hurt too much if you forget a few assignments if you study the review and homework problems before the tests you should be fine
1.0,M,i cannot understand what he is saying his notes are very messy and his handwriting is horrible his tests are similar to the homework but he is not good at explaining anything i had him for fluids and dynamics and both times were miserable do not take him for anything
2.0,M,dr sharif comes to class with problems to work out these problems are almost identical to the online homework however he often makes confused with his own work this can make the class confusing his tests are very similar to the homework make sure you actually know how to do the homework and not just copy it from your notes
3.0,M,take him if you plan on taking dynamics he is supposed to be pretty good with fluid mechanics but he very comfortable teaching dynamics
5.0,W,mchugh is the best professor i have had at merrimack she is very passionate and respects view had her twice and wish i could take her class again
4.0,W,a really great professor her lectures are fun and she really wants to hear her students opinions in class gives very minimum hw and is easy to maintain your grade if you just do what she gives you so active around campus and will be more than willing to help you in whatever you need
5.0,M,no exaggeration when i say mr hu is one of the best teachers had is not easy and it covers many topics yet i was able to work the hw based almost entirely on what i learned in lecture engaging caring hilarious and approachable he makes himself available outside of class and is responsive to he is rooting for you
5.0,M,he will teach you outside the box and if you attend his class everyday and put some work i guarantee you will be ready for your next math class
5.0,M,took mr summer school course he was awesome explains everything in detail he is well organized and goes over things that way you definitely absorb the information i would take him again
3.0,M,he makes it clear on the first day what he expects from the class he grades by how well you do compared to the class he has a very thick accent and makes jokes about math majors and being from china you will hear the word lousy and stupid everyday he uses it to describe everything he goes super fast and you need to study outside of class
5.0,M,has a very thick accent but all his notes and examples he puts on the board are clear and straight forward very useful for math daily lectures help tremendously with the hw do the hw to help pass the quiz the next day quizzes are daily he will go over anything people have trouble with grades on a curve
5.0,M,great teacher in ccsf very funny and his logic is very clear this teacher really get you ready for math and math
5.0,M,mr hu is a great professor and can be quite humorous i took him for both math he takes attendance by use of daily quizzes and these will add up so come to class we did massive amounts of homework especially during the summer but it was always out of the book and not online his exams can be tough so prepare yourself by studying
1.0,M,definitely the hardest class taken at ua he makes up his own versions of the textbook graphs with about examples on the hw and study guide then he changes the graphs on tests in every possible way and be ready for him to take off points for your lines not being perfectly tangent and minor labeling errors would not recommend
4.0,M,class is difficult and fast paced and homework are for extra credit but you pass if you go he lectures the entire class and there are homework assignments every week the tests are mostly from the study guides which are from the homework go to the review session and study and a manageable a
4.0,M,paul is weird but funny his notes are everything-go to class definitely do the homework get an answer key as well as the review sessions he basically gives you answers to the test he is definitely a tough grader but gives you everything you need to be successful also gives up to extra credit points for hmk participation
4.0,M,not a bad choice for ec he has dry humor i made an a in his class and studied a day or two before the test not very smart either
4.0,M,great guy a bit monotone though definitely recommend his class
1.0,M,worst teacher at ua we pay too much for him to be a professor here
1.0,M,by far worst ever had ua should fire him today i am a straight a student who got my first c because he was such a bad professor
2.0,W,she sometimes lectures but she likes to rant about politics most of the time her rubric and instructions for getting an a during an exam is very unclear since everyone in the class followed them and no one got anything above a b coming from a computer science student who gets and this is the first grade below b that getting
2.0,W,do not take this professor she is not specific on anything she is not organized at all which causes you to be confused most of the time she is a tough grader and only wants you to believe what she believes thanks to her bad organization skills i now have four assignments due in one week as finals are approaching do not take her
1.0,W,the class was not useful at all the most important thing is that this professor is fake and do not respect the students take her class
3.0,W,take this class if genuinely passionate about asian american history a lot of the people that like her really interested in the content very vague when it comes to assignments a midterm a final and some outside work but as long as you put that you deserve an a on the self evaluations get an a
1.0,W,terrible confusing and not clear about what she wants she will change her mind every five seconds takes forever to grade homework and papers everything that she says is right so you better agree with her
3.0,M,beneski is very monotone and the lectures are dry you need to go to class and take good notes because he goes into much more detail just off the top of his head in order to get a good grade you have to be able to apply the material in the test start to prepare for the test weeks in advance its doable
1.0,M,he makes bio so hard to understand very smart but know how to make the material easy to understand at all i studied incredibly hard for his exams worked with friends etc and failed all exams there are exams all worth points he crams weeks work of material into one exam you will be lost with him as your teacher
1.0,M,worst professor at wcu i have never had such a rude uncaring professor his lectures do little to prepare you for the exam and his power points are confusing and have slim to none useful info on them i am pretty sure he is glad that his class is close to impossible not sure why a professor because it seems like he hates students his job
1.0,M,the class needs a complete upgrade from the way information is given the lectures are very heavy and dry with plenty of terms and functions being explained in a short amount of time beneski does not give study guides test reviews worksheets or any practice work to help you before the exams he flys through info most students rely on tutors
1.0,M,i studied for hours made over note cards and watched videos on the topics he had on his slides the slides have no information on them none of that helped me with his exam as they are all applied questions and extra material not in the slides he does not answer any my emails with questions and simply does not care he is horrible and rude
3.0,M,the material is extremely dull but he really makes you remember that it is dull he tries to confuse you but you just need to write down every single thing he says if you attend every class and take notes you will pass i studied a lot from the terms of words and it helped a ton even though his last two tests seemed foreign
4.0,M,a lot of people blame beneski for his teaching style but really it is just a difficult course if you attend every lecture take good notes and study what he says you should be able to do decently on the tests even if you understand what he is saying write it down and study it later because it will most likely be on the test
2.0,M,beneski clearly knows his stuff but does not know how to teach it to others lectures are boring and monotone making it very difficult to focus tests expect you to completely understand every aspect of the material as well as be able to apply it to situations recommend studying for tests weeks in advance record the lectures and watch videos
3.0,M,he is okay at explaining things but definitely go to class the slides are useless recording the lectures is helpful because the tests are extremely hard be careful with the online quizzes too he never reminds you and easy to miss and forget about
1.0,M,he is trash i had tests and lab practicals and each test and practical was completely different than the last making it almost impossible to know how to study the lab practicals in particular were a complete from each other we basically guaranteed me to fail he is mean uncaring and he likes to make rules to hurt you
1.0,M,he really knows what hes talking about but he the best teacher lectures are very monotone and the only grades are exams and a month he tell you about any deadlines you are just expected to know when the tests are and when the are due his class does not co-inside with the lab at all
3.0,M,interesting material but beneski is really dry he has a few good jokes but the material is just so hard and it is hard to focus anatomy will take up your life so be prepared to study hard it is doable
2.0,M,beneski is a very smart man and really knows his stuff about anatomy but he is not the best at teaching it he lectures very monotone and it can be hard to keep up with so i recommend recording the lectures because you need to know literally every little detail for the exams you need to put at least hours in a week if you want a good grade
5.0,W,i loved professor root i had her for body conditioning and she was so nice and amazing the class works you and make you feel like had a good work out root really cares about her job and her students i would definitely take again
5.0,M,recommend rick his american gov course was amazing he gave very interesting and sometimes even entertaining lectures and he makes the course very relatable to self it was definitely not what i thought it would be--i had imagined a boring textbook-reading heavy class--and i appreciate his way of teaching so much gotta love rick
4.0,M,amazing and funny lectures has a very honest view of american government which i enjoy his quizzes and papers are super easy i literally read learned nothing and still got a make sure you turn stuff in because if not he might not get back to you to turn in late work also assignments are due at pm not
1.0,M,dr tjaden is such a dark spot among all the other great professors in the department every class was lecture read word for word from the textbook slides projects do not have clear criteria and require you talking to him a dozen times to actually understand them majorly disappointed in this class and professor
5.0,M,it is mandatory to take religion at bryn athyn and i did so without the best attitude however thane and the new approach to religion is thoughtful and inspiring it is quite evident that thane really cares about the material he is teaching and the students i am a better person for having had this class
2.0,W,take this course if ready to be treated like you did nothing great outside of class but her way or the high way
1.0,W,the class and lab bad especially if you are interested in environmental geochemistry it is actually very interesting the problem is her she is very snappy she teach things right or give proper instructions on labs but then snaps at you for not knowing it
5.0,M,amazing professor cares about his students the class is not easy yet it is doable to get a good grade requires lots of time and effort professor is helpful in office hours and makes the infomation clear and easy to understand be careful of careless mistakes class is interesting and challenging
5.0,M,currently enrolled in his inorganic course and he is absolutely amazing yes you will need to study yes the exams can be a bit tricky all about the time you put into studying a great lecturer and you should focus on studying the hw not graded he assigns very helpful during office hours as well
5.0,M,dr talham is the best professor i have had at uf had him for chem if you expect an easy a then take him he will make you work for your grade but be fair in doing so acknowledging that his class was hard he changed the grading scale to about an being an a the downside is that he travels but that is expected for a tenured prof
2.0,W,she cares about students but i fond of her teaching she tended to misinterpret students questions so get a long winded answer to a question you ask she took attendance but i think lecture was necessary homework graded but preps you for quizzes
4.0,W,she knows her stuff and is very helpful cs lectures can be boring so no surprise there learned a lot but i take her unless you are a major overall very personable and sweet would take again
1.0,W,very ill prepared and scattered professor very often goes off on tangents that relate to the class she does not explain even basic concepts in a way that everyone can understand and instead writes definitions followed by a poor example if you understand after that sol first test had various students with grades below a
1.0,W,had her for two semesters now her lectures consist of showing us various definitions and examples but not really explaining them i had to learn most things by religiously examining the textbook and watching videos online going to class always felt like a waste of time but required expect to be confused every class period
1.0,W,she really teach us she shows us things she explain how to use them in certain situations which makes her a poor professor and she takes great joy in making the tests abnormally difficult
1.0,W,the professor is a nightmare i understand that the professor is merely to show you a path then you go upon a journey to learn but when that professor only gives you a hammer and some nails and expects you to build the titanic when i respect her tldr she gives you basics but help you with anything else suicide for grade
2.0,W,take her if you have no prior experience with coding
5.0,W,i took professor usyk this summer for statistics and honestly can say that i grew and learned a lot during my time in her class her lectures are easy to follow and she explains things clearly she is straightforward with her expectations yes she expects a lot from her students but she also is willing to help if you put in the neccessary effort
1.0,M,the absolute worse would not recommend taking i know i think twice about taking him very ignorant rude and the worse if you have the option to take him
5.0,M,if you dont pass with an a in this class then you did something wrong only thing you do all year is lectures and there are test if you get an a on the first two then you dont have to take the final test he gives you the test as a study guide literally hands you the exact test just look over notes and power points
5.0,M,a hour class that meets once a week it can seem long at first but take him if you can i simply loved him and his classes they were always a nice break from the heavy course work of my major he requires nothing except to engage in class when there attendance was never required but everyone usually showed up because we loved him
5.0,W,i have anxiety issues and i was afraid of online classes ms sailors gave me her phone number and let me with issues during regular workday hours this helped me succeed in my very first online class there is a lot of reading but i found the book helpful and informative i believe i learned a great deal in this class
5.0,W,good teacher she gave clear explanations of mark ups on papers there is lots of reading and you pass the quizzes if you do not read you also need to pay attention to announcements and extra handouts there is stuff not in the book that you will lose points for if you read the stuff she posts
5.0,W,professor sailors is great all of her assignments are pretty easy and you can tell she knows the subject very well make sure to complete the assignments and do the discussion participation the quizzes come straight from the book take her if she is available
1.0,M,terrible you cant understand him and he even know how to work webassign or blackboard very thick accent with very poor english take him unless you want to teach yourself
4.0,M,very good teacher soft spoken but takes amazing notes he is the best drawer ever for a math instructor his test are exactly like the old ones that he gives out and he gives bonus on every test
3.0,M,he has a thick accent and gives a lot of homework class was very challenging
5.0,M,after repeatidly taking this course i took this professor in the summer got an a he lectures from the moment class starts to a little over the class end time to take notes i used my macbook and found it much easier to follow his layout follow his layout study his notes in the layout he gives hrs a day his test come straight from notes
5.0,M,great professor his notes are very clear and organized if you study and understand the notes you will be perfectly fine he gives lots of examples and is super interesting he makes biology fun and helped me want to learn he wont give your grade have to earn it but he is fair take him always available for help and he cares
5.0,M,dr nicoletto is an amazing professor i highly recommend him and would take him again he is inspirational and is always available to help you do have to show up to class because his tests are all from his lecture he posts on bb with illustrations but he post his notes must study daily but thats with any science class
4.0,W,she was awesome take attendance but does in class responses randomly easy a if you have the notes exams you can use a notecard so it too bad plenty of opportunities for extra credit would definitely take her again
4.0,W,pay attention in class or get notes from a friend and do fine there are in class quizzes at the end but you can use notes tests concerts and project all easy to get on she is helpful if you email her or talk to her after class boring class but super easy a
5.0,W,lindahl was a great professor to have for this class you are required to go to concerts for the class throughout the semester but less than other professors if you keep up on the online quizzes you can always get and do the extra credit youll be totally fine she really wanted her students to succeed and is very helpful
3.0,W,she the most sympathetic professor but it is so easy to pass the class she offers so much extra credit and you can take the quizzes until you get on them show up to class though because there are little in-class responses that add up to points throughout the semester you have to attend concerts and write about them overall ok
5.0,W,great class all you have to do is show up and pay attention make sure you get the right notecards i went to a performing arts school in middle school so i already knew most of the things but she does explain things really well and she is willing to help if you dont the class was with about other kids so go to her office hours if need be
5.0,W,dr lindahl is great i am not majoring in anything music-related but took this class because i heard it was an easier wi she even give that many writing assignments and the ones that she does assign are easy the homework is really simple and the exams too bad either go to class because she does in-class assignments sometimes
5.0,W,prof lindahl was great she knew that almost the entire class was taking it because it was an easy up easy homework online music guides that had to be completed in a week no reason why you get an a all the answers were in the book so the assignments were very easy a great prof if you understand music as she makes it fun
1.0,W,absolutely terrible this been stressful af her online class is so disorganized she grades essays strictly by format so f useless i could learn more from a brick wall that from her i felt like i was begging for help to no avail students that either were interested in learning or at least want a fair teacher avoid
1.0,W,ewrt class is the worst online class i have taken she makes no effort to explain anything let alone teach and her comments on papers are vague and unhelpful if you want to learn anything about writing you are in the wrong class if you want to work very hard for a low grade and be on your own this is the class for you
5.0,M,he has a lot of heart and loves to teach he will make you an outstanding classical guitarist and a great lead guitar player if you play steel guitar too just be open to his teaching method and put in the hours
5.0,M,do not take this class if you just want to learn regular guitar not just nylon string this class is classical style only you need to take instead there you can play acoustic or nylon string and cover several styles in jones class you have to play exactly how he tells you so if you change your playing way you be happy
5.0,M,prof jones is an excellent passionate classical guitar teacher he teaches music theory so you understand it too his class is for classical guitar so be serious and open to this method he knows what he is talking about and there is a reason why you must do it as instructed it will all make sense when you advance to the more elaborate pieces
2.0,M,dr boucher seems to be a nice person that wants his students to do well however he expects a great load of work and participation in class as an incoming freshman i managed to do pretty well in all of my other classes except this one it felt like more of a philosophy class that was set up for failure rather than a normal history class
5.0,M,dr boucher is super personable and nice his history lectures are interesting even thoough not a huge fan of european history really funny as well you definitely need to read the books he assigns as you have quizzes on them but for the most part not much quizzing on stuff he posts online unless he talks about it in class
4.0,M,love this guy the american west is a very interesting course however his class is solely based on readings and discussion make sure you read read read and you will do fine
4.0,M,like others have said class is extremely workload heavy expect a paper test or project due weekly but foreman really knows his stuff and wants you to succeed if you put the work gives out so much extra credit that impossible to fail and getting an a or b is doable if you care about learning take this professor
2.0,M,foreman really knows his stuff and is beyond knowledgeable about the subject matter the class is very workload heavy with weekly case analyses exams and group projects foreman is a hard grader with high expectations of his students be prepared to spend many long nights typing papers and conducting very in-depth case analyses
5.0,M,dr foreman is a teacher that actually cares about your education if you do the material can be difficult but if you put in the effort and study you can get an a he is easy to listen to during lectures and the course-work for me was very interesting pretty funny guy too
5.0,M,jay is a straight forward professor he teaches for concepts not for memorization which is helpful he is funny and occasionally takes the day to just talk politics with his class and get to know students there are frequent quizzes but they cover literally exactly what he taught in class exams are predictable if you go to class and do the work
4.0,M,he is probably the funniest teacher ever does a great job explaining concepts but take too well to questions he has a low tolerance for self-explanatory questions because he expects highly from people in calc ii but it is definitely worth taking especially from jay ko
3.0,M,i took his online intro to statistics class he leave feedback on problems miss in order to tell me what i was doing wrong so have to commute to college to talk to him in person
1.0,M,i have taken classes with him before but not online and loved it his on-line course is disorganized and extremely difficult to follow took class in the fall and he still had the schedule up for spring lack of communication and very difficult to contact
5.0,M,if you pay attention turn work in on time and follow his instructions you will breeze by he as a wonderful professor and keeps class entertaining
5.0,M,dr f is the best he cares for each and every student that is sitting in front of him he has been so helpful to me throughout my stint here at eku he has been with me every step of the way he was also my adviser if you want to learn from the best take dr f he really is awesome
1.0,W,disrespectful towards students when you ask her a simple question goes way too fast in lectures and does an awful job preparing you for quizzes do not take her
1.0,W,very rude treats you like a child because she thinks grad students are superior class isnt that hard but take another professor if possible
1.0,W,this class about killed me seriously this was an online class and there was no routine she refused to answer questions and she always tried to confuse students on the quizzes you can listen to the lectures times do all the practice problems correctly then get to the test and be like what the crap is she talking about
4.0,M,i enjoyed the class and teacher as most history majors there is addendai reading to be done great teacer and am glad i had him in class
5.0,M,after i read these reviews i want to like this class but one smile at me the first day and he got me yeah he knows a campus rock star but it only adds to his charm the man just loves his job never in a bad mood passionate and brilliant every class is a show and learn alot sit in front for the best view
5.0,M,class was fun but i go i read or do anything i was going to withdraw midterm but he told me if i committed hard to class he would help me with the work and maybe i could pass on a d worked my butt off and got a b at the end really really good guy because he cares about students and helps so much best professor ever
5.0,M,dr rahimzadeh is intimidating at first and yes arrogant but he has every right to be he has such a strong grasp of early english literature and his lectures immediately pull you in brilliant and passionate and very funny after a few weeks you realize so sweet too and his clothes are cuter than anybody in class a plus
5.0,M,totally adorable this weird combination of super shy and super aggressive at the same time everything you want from a professor crazy smart and always entertaining listen to lectures carefully because every sentence he says is hilarious every single one and like he says do the reading come to class take notes go home with the a
5.0,M,if you take this professor during your time at eku you will never forgive yourself if every professor were like him id never want to graduate he is absolutely incredible he cares about the students he is insanely smart and outgoing and wants to see you succeed please if you get the chance take class with him you regret it
5.0,M,if you have the chance to take him do it he will make you work for your grade but if you put in the effort he is willing to give you as much help as you need he seriously is amazing
1.0,W,the lab portion of chem is ran by monica pray that you do not have her as your ta she is unkind and very very intimidating you can not mess up or make a mistake if she is anywhere near by chem labs are marked very unfairly because not all the mark the same chem labs are extremely time consuming and misleading go to help hours
1.0,W,the rumors are true she is a very difficult woman but if you need chem for your degree you avoid her she is the senior lab instruction for yr labs and the prof for though you have to teach yourself everything its online be prepared get your work in on time and hope for the best its not likely have any grace
1.0,W,monica in person outside of class she can be nice in class another story she is very rude unreasonable and she gives you the run around like she be bothered if you have to take chem i suggest you take it at camosun and transfer the credits i have had to go over her head many times for my lab to be graded again for a proper mark
4.0,W,she marks hard but consistent when i asked for feedback on a grade i found harsh she willingly set up a meeting and explain where i lost points and how i could improve my lab marks significantly increased following this meeting i found her very helpful if questions were well thought out and relevant
2.0,W,my first ever ta at university she really goes hard on you especially on safety but because this is your first chemistry lab and if you get it down now get hurt later on and she does not want that at all nice sometimes sometimes not really hit or miss switch if you can future labs will be better if you continue chem
1.0,W,because of her behaviors i changed the major she is very tough grader proferrsor during my first year in the university i faced lots of probelms and these probelms because of her i emailed her for asking the questions about lab she told me that i need to study by myself and she was not a high school teacher i was so dejected
5.0,M,great professor by far the best one i have had for an online class about essays throughout the class but makes it clear of what he expects gives feedback even if it is just to say it was a good essay which i believe means a lot
5.0,W,mrs phillips is a very caring teacher she will work with your schedule just ask she loves biology and expects a lot but i appreciate that as a major keep up take good notes she is very fair i loved the class and mrs phillips
5.0,W,mary wells phillips bio for majors she is a great professor she can be a bit confusing but she cares shes super sweet and cares for her students education you will have to do a semester project that deals with research or volunteering work and a presentation for all of it you can either choose a research project or to volunteer
5.0,W,prof class was pretty enjoyable to take i had been dreading taking bio but she has made it an easy experience i was in a blended class that met once a week for lab so for our class she was a little easier with the deadlines but really understanding if not interested in doing a semester project take the class
5.0,W,professor phillips does everything she can to make learning fun and easy to understand she helps you be the best you can be in her class and she is full of amazing stories and information about biology
5.0,W,i enjoyed the class a lot the first couple of labs were a little confusing but after that the remaining labs were great professor phillips was always well organized and always wanted her students to succeed even though i have not been big into science or biology this class taught me a lot very nice and helpful when life happens
5.0,W,great instructor and person very organized gives great feedback practice exams yeah makes you ask questions wish she taught other courses absolutely recommend ms phillips loved her and her class
1.0,M,very confusing makes the simplest problems so confusing never been taught math in the way that he teaches it better off teaching myself do yourself a favor and take him unless your good at math
4.0,M,make you buy a book that you really should buy i got it for on amazon he tends to ramble and can be pretentious sometimes and the three hour time slot is annoying but overall i really liked this class this convinced me to take more phil classes a quiz every class and a movie before all of them i only wish it was earlier in the day
2.0,M,hoyt will have you read at least pages for every class however you will only ever get through about pages worth of discussion rambles on and on when asking questions is searching for something so specific he just keeps asking people until he gets close or we run out of time
5.0,M,rich bodek is the best teacher at this school he is so intelligent and passionate about what he does and gets really excited when students are engaged he really cares about students and have tests or quizzes you just have to read every night its such an interesting class and he really makes you want to learn
5.0,M,i took his class in the summer and hate history but i loved this class because he was hilarious and told really funny stories about his life that related to the topic he lectures a lot but interesting because a quirky man also a pretty grader
5.0,M,this is the second class taken with craig and i have learned so much he is a tough grader but the very nature of sculpture is difficult if your hard work is apparent he will notice but you have to really try to get an a in his class attendance is mandatory like all studio classes and final documentation is also a big part of your grade
3.0,W,to be fair i am rating blanck on her interdisciplinary research and writing class which is a co-taught class you will get three professors each for weeks focusing on a different subject the class is awful there is so much work with little communication between the professors unfortunately it is mandatory for american studies majors gl
5.0,M,dr r is a gem in the em program he is a tough grader and is picky about what he wants but he makes you work for your degree honestly he is not exactly an expert in the field of sport and music management but he will try his best to help you out and find people that can answer your questions he really cares about his students get to know him
1.0,M,he is so unclear about what he wants he actually told us what he wanted for a project presentation then counted us off when we presented saying he tell us any of those things he has no idea who you are even if you want to think he does he could care less about you he is the only teacher so it made me want to change my major
1.0,M,terrible professor his lecture slides are random quotes pasted from a journal abstract and to learn anything you need to read all the journals is it laziness probably if you like reading journals per lecture leaving more confused after asking him a question or being stood up at his office hours take a course with mccarthy
5.0,M,a hilarious teacher he always wanted to take the time to help out students do the best they could if you try in this class its an easy a
5.0,M,shane is a great teacher he always makes sure everyone understands and is totally willing to help with problems even if it means looking into it after hours for a student his lessons are clear and leave you prepared to complete the labs and in class assessments
3.0,M,great instructor sadly not enough variety on exercises lab and quiz questions half the time are not near what you were taught lectures are great and he is available to answer any questions but his grading system is way too strict and he will deduct marks for the most minor error that has no effect on the code itself expect less mark
5.0,M,shane bell was surprisingly cool he cared about the class and his students and he always wanted everyone to succeed his classes were fun and engaging and he did a lot of in-class activities that got everybody involved with the course material if there was ever a problem shane was always willing to help in any way he could very awesome
5.0,M,dwayne was a funny teacher that was very helpful in bringing realism and humor to the project management course be warned overly sensitive students may not enjoy him he was available to give you constructive criticism on your assignments and related any issues he found with them to real life examples
5.0,M,he is one of the amazing teachers at nait he has a great level of sarcasm his teaching method is different which make everything so easy to understand he relates things to daily life and gives different example which makes it so easy to understand
5.0,M,honestly i thought dwayne rurka was the best professor i have even encountered at the lectures were interesting he made sure the students were included in the arguments and he kept us on out toes i really took in what he taught from his classes and have new respect for other perspectives so i want to say thank you
4.0,M,how can you hate him lots of extra bonus points and he recycles his questions he really tries his best to keep the class entertained i believe he wants the best for his students but his teaching technique isnt really the best make sure you try to understand the content before class and his teaching supplements whatever youve got go for dgds
5.0,M,hilarious guy however i found i was doing lots of self-learning he is not the best at explaining concepts and some parts felt a little rushed like rotational dynamics however he is so generous with marks he gives tons of extra credit and the questions he asks on assignments and tests are very fair if you did well in grade physics ur good
5.0,M,prof czajkowski is the only prof for this course and is the best he can be intimidating but he is hilarious his marking is really fair such that you will not be able to fail his class unless you put in no work the final was multiple choice which was good midterms were quite hard but he gives many opportunities to bring your mark up
3.0,M,he gets angry at students from time to time and i remember ever being on schedule in his class he skips over some content in class sometimes would ask tas to make up for it in dgds the assignments are hard but if you can do them good for the midterms exam was more challenging in addition to being entirely multiple choice
4.0,M,great prof while the content is hard he is a funny lecturer and makes it really difficult to fail take the class as an elective but czajkowski makes it easy to enjoy hilarious emails too
3.0,M,sends the most hilarious emails if you get his sarcasm you will hate him accent is thick but still easy to understand attending the lectures is a must content posted online doing an assignment every week is annoying but easily brings up your grade midterms and exams were fair to what we saw in class posts old tests and breakdown
3.0,M,not the best teacher he goes over a lot of the assignments in class and makes it very difficult to fail i failed a midterm and the final and still managed to pass with over a also do the extra credit it can take pretty close to off the final exam very difficult class if you take high school physics go to class worth it
5.0,M,reviewers say czajkowski is rude but because no one understand sarcasm these days i found him to be very outside of lectures office hours where you can talk to him on many complain about how heavy the course is but assignments are optional bonus points kids are also salty since they take hs physics
5.0,M,there are assignments every week which although is a lot only of possible points actually counts which leaves out assignments you only lose bonus marks from him if you ask questions from a lecture weeks ago there are many practice quizzes at the dgds to help you a great prof and wants to help but a difficult course
2.0,M,he has a huge ego he likes to single out students in class and embarrass them for answering questions wrong and thinks he is a lot better of a teacher than he actually is he also takes away marks if you ever email him or go to his office hours he really like to help students gives lots of homework and just rude in general
1.0,M,this class will take over your life the prof is extremely egotistical and thinks he is the best thing since sliced bread he no written feedback until the if this course is a requirement for you recommend trying to get another prof or get well acquainted with khan academy and be prepared to self teach
2.0,M,just a jerk he expects you to pick up the material immediately and is shocked if you get it like he does says some funny things in class but about it otherwise a hard professor not looking to help you
2.0,M,he is rude when you talk to him he turns your back towards you and starts talking to somebody else on the final exam he changed the order of the questions but forgot to change the order of the answers in addition the scanner missed some answers we were shocked when we received the results but he would not believe us that something went wrong
5.0,M,favourite first year prof genuinely cares about students with pre-lecture quizzes assignments etc he gives you more than enough of a chance to bump up your grade his are very reasonable do the assignments and go to class oftentimes midterm questions will be taken straight from assignments and in-class questions
3.0,M,osland is a very nice man his intro marketing class however is tough the lectures are fun but his grades are not posted on moodle also he grades very subjectively by always requiring essays on exams vs multiple choice study very hard for this class
1.0,M,very dull course tests are difficult and the class is a bore to sit through am not a fan of him or his teaching methods
1.0,W,college geometry is a self taught course she literally teach anything if you know what proofs are or have a good sense of geometry this class is not for you she teach she expects you to already know everything and if you know she help you
4.0,M,knows what talking about everything is explained on the syllabus you have to read the instructions and follow them if you follow instructions you lose points no duh not confusing if you know how to read if you ask questions via email he responds
1.0,M,he is a very tough grader he docks points for almost anything all his tests are completely fill in and are very confusing he is biased towards his book being that he is the co-author try to explain concepts in a different way even when students understand he does not show interest or concern about his students do not take him
5.0,M,professor rooney was great he is very funny guy but sometimes thinks a little funnier than he really is as for the class pretty simple the only homework is read and a must to pass the class unless you can listen and learn also there are practice tests online that he pulls questions from so do those too
4.0,W,dr untereiner is passionate about what she teaches which helps stimulate interest class attendance is a must as tests come from class notes show her respect and she will show you the same cares about her students is reasonable about expectations and can definitely get in her classes would take again
5.0,M,loved loved loved dr snider perhaps because i love chem lab but snider is amazing to take for lab hysterical and a great professor he is there to help you at any time and has a great personality also make you do all the post lab work awesome take him again in a heart beat
4.0,M,dr snider is one of the best i have ever taken yes he is a tough grader but he made me a better student if you do not like online do not take him very caring entertaining and helpful
4.0,M,he is hilarious but a tough grader if you go to office hours he would be gladly to help overall just a great person to talk to
1.0,W,has obvious favourites is rude to people who are not her favourites is not whatsoever clear on any explanations for any type of project even after being asked many times for clarification is very picky as to what she wants on tests papers and presentations i do not recommend this prof avoid her classes at all cost i learned the hard way
2.0,W,this professor almost made me switch my entire career plan if you do not need her do not take her she is not receptive to any feedback on her teaching methods and will make you feel like an idiot if you are struggling in her classes overall she is not pleasant
5.0,M,i love this guy he really wants his students to succeed and a funny guy a quiz almost every week and only exams if you read the book and do homework problems on the stuff you understand you should be set for an a he lets you have a cheat sheet too for the exams
5.0,M,great teacher easy to follow understand show up take notes do the optional hw and you will pass with an a quiz every week helps you to know material and prepares you for the exams funny when you least expect it would take another math class with him as my teacher ec at the end of semester if you come to class everyday
5.0,M,one of the best math professors ever had attendance optional however if you attend most of his classes give you extra credit at the end of the semester final was lightweight and took half of the period real chill prof will be taking him again in the future
5.0,M,professor chung is a great teacher sometimes he copies and pastes hw questions directly from the textbook onto the exams and he usually tells the class beforehand what kind of questions be be prepared for free response questions along with multiple choice overall if you study hard get an a
5.0,M,prof chung is very straight forward if you go to all of his classes definitely get a good grade utilize the opportunity to go to office hours he goes over test reviews in class and shows us how to do them
1.0,M,although chung is a knowledgeable man and understands the material he teaches he is an extremely rude and inconsiderate person i witnessed a total lack of sensitivity as he heartlessly gave this student a very difficult time during office hours for no apparent reason to the point where she was in tears and he was still giving her a blank stare
1.0,W,although chung is a knowledgeable man and understands the material he teaches he is an extremely rude and inconsiderate person i witnessed a total lack of sensitivity as he heartlessly gave this student a very difficult time during office hours for no apparent reason to the point where she was in tears and he was still giving her a blank stare
4.0,M,really fun in class and defintiely into what teaching be ready for him to get really side tracked and share quite a bit about his personal life almost always hilarious though he really cares about what he teaches and when he assigns readings you really do need to do them if not you can get by but be difficult
4.0,M,dr arrey is an extremely funny and smart professor many people find him to be mean but he truly wants everyone to pass his class is extremely hard but its pretty straightforward study everything in his packets
4.0,W,tests are reasonably easy if you prepare you are given test outlines she is very helpful gives opportunity for extra marks bonus assignments at the end of the semester she is very well organized and to the point one of my best professors
5.0,W,super nice great teacher super helpful if you show up and put in effort she will help you to get a good grade
3.0,W,she will help you learn a lot about writing you need to be organized and do your work
4.0,M,i loved professor sadkowski a very funny guy with somewhat interesting lectures you have to read a lot in his class or else you pass his quizzes are based from his mini-books you have to read along with the class one read or else you pass pretty hard to without them
5.0,M,i loved his class his sense of humor was amazing he also attempted to learn name the only problem i had with the class is that i care for some of the books
3.0,M,way too much work for an lac humanities course a great funny guy but this class was difficult and i went to every class and hardcore studied the course guidebook helps immensely it has study guides in it but tests are still difficult make sure you read the books he assigns the grading scale is super lenient i got a which is a b
3.0,M,sadkowski was a nice guy but his lectures were really boring and there was a lot of reading involved tests were difficult but he has a pretty nice grading scale so it evens out a bit
3.0,M,sadkowski is one of the nicest professors ever had i took humanities with him and his lectures can get really boring because all he does it talk and you have to look through your course packet and write down what he says if you follow along then you pass he gives study guides to use before the tests but overall i liked him
5.0,M,there are a lot of readings outside of class but he covers the main ideas in lecture well papers are pretty big but manageable and he leaves feedback in a timely fashion i feel like i learned a lot in both law and the courts and law and politics and would definitely recommend those classes
2.0,M,only grades are papers and exams he is a tough grader you have an extra credit opportunity where you can type three papers but you can only get a total of one combined all tests are on quizlet but you only get minutes for questions i thought the class was super boring you have a total of papers attendance is required
5.0,M,fyi professor scott peters is listed on myuniverse as christopher s peters dr peters has been an amazing professor for every class i have taken with him he is so knowledgable on our courts system and he is so good at teaching in a way that is understandable to those with no knowledge of law or politics highly recommend this professor
5.0,M,peters is a really great professor this is the or class taken with him and he always has very clear grading criteria clear explanations during class and a real passion for what he does extremely knowledgeable but if he know the answer to a question you have take time to find it for you excellent guy
2.0,W,horrible so many papers she is a tough grader at least papers due every single week not sure if it is different in-class but i will never do this again
1.0,W,lot of writing but fine with that great textbook choice test match the coursework covered the issue is if you regurgitate the views she shares not the text or material the way that she wants your grade will suffer
3.0,W,dr p is an odd character but overall psych of women is very easy the class consists of or take home exams and no homework or quizzes very easy she will go off on a tangent for hours if you let her
3.0,W,easy a for sure administered the wrong exam twice to us still made us take the correct exams sure she lost exam because we still received our grades the semester is about to end gets off topic definitely feel like a level course she is a nice lady and accepts late work exams mult choice one paper
4.0,W,tough grader thought the class would be easy and work to improve my writing as not pursuing a degree in the humanities if serious about becoming a better i would highly recommend her nice person and seems passionate and knowledgeable take your essays seriously she is not impressed by stoned rambling
5.0,M,not a whole lot of formal teaching there were some lecture notes but not every week but the textbook he uses is very informational and easy to understand so teaching myself that much of a problem lots of extra credit opportunities would take again would recommend to those who mind sort of teaching themselves
5.0,M,great lectures homework assigned helps with studying for tests practice quizzes were similar to tests he responds to emails within the same day
5.0,M,best teacher had at pierce in my two years here so far i highly recommend taking his class if you get an opportunity very clear grading with very manageable work loads he always sets dates and lets you know what is due when and how to do it gives answers on all homework lots of extra credit opportunities i ended the class with over
5.0,M,one of the easiest and best classes ever taken homework was a breeze but exams require a little more work textbook is free online lots of extra credit he raised my to a amazing
3.0,M,this economics class was a solid choice for the most part his online readings were very clear and had good insights into economics however he makes you do at least one exam in-person at the testing center his two online exams were all multiple choice except for a few calculations his in-person exam was all short answer and was quite harder
5.0,M,this professor was awesome he gives a lot of opportunity for extra credit way more than any other professor i have had really hard to fail this class he drops the lowest of exams which means if you like your grade no final homework and discussions you get full points for just for turning it in on time there are no surprises
5.0,W,professor moore is the best math teacher ever had horrible at math and i struggled in this class but she helped me so much and never allowed me to give up she truly motivates you to want to do well and gives a lot of positive reenforcement tests are all cumulative which is tough but there are plenty of review sessions take her
5.0,W,kathy moore is the best math teacher i have ever had if you can get in her class do so she makes mathematics interesting and her passion for math makes her class fun she is very helpful and will explain how to do the problems in very clear simple ways her classes are the only time enjoyed math
5.0,W,professor moore was amazing makes math super easy and explains everything very well you do not need a textbook so you will save a ton of money i strongly suggest her
5.0,W,took dr knight for creative writing and was very pleased the woman is absolutely hilarious she was a nurse and a police officer before she was a professor so her stories go from real quick you write original pieces in various genres and done would recommend
4.0,W,she is very simple the class is clear to follow she can be a bit of a picky grader as she will not really give perfect scores for simple assignments she does let you re-submit to gain back any lost points and lets you turn in late assignments easy to approach easy to get a good grade if you just go to class and do all the assignments
4.0,W,dr saffran is an excellent choice for the class is either filled with seniors or graduate students so not competing with freshmen anymore her tests are tough but like kumar and expect the occasional trick question she adjusts the grade by a few points based on how well the class is doing straightforward
2.0,M,he does tell you what questions are exactly going to be on the exams thats why i did well in his class unclear in his teaching so i just memorize what he writes i honestly learned much from him he says easy a third grader can understand this been teaching this course for many years so of course easy to him
4.0,M,mitra is very knowledgable in math one of the smartest professors around he does get little annoyed when students ask him questions from previous courses he expects you to know everything however his reviews are similar to exams so do ll the class problems and review you should be fine not a real tough grader gives lot of partial credit
5.0,M,as always he do much to mislead his students he tests you on what he says test you on save for about points of stuff that on the review to see if you really learned anything and just memorize the review it is very easy to do well in his class and the graduate students love him
3.0,W,professor lectures are read straight out of the textbook but she cover everything in the required textbook so if you go to class you need to read the textbook i would suggest going to class because she does help with the online homework assignments not a bad professor but her polish accent takes a while to get used to
1.0,W,professor malitsky is not a very effective teacher there is no discussion section for this class and all her lectures are problems straight out of the book she is also not friendly at all all of the exams that go along with this class are a lot harder than any examples she does in lecture and are very hard to be well prepared for
5.0,W,incredible teacher has a great sense of humor and a true sense to ensure her students are learning material curves and other grades are very fair but you have to work for your grade
2.0,W,this class is unnecessarily hard because i knew that some of the ways we were taught could be much easier just by explain a different way to solve it i felt like she chose the hardest most challenging way to solve every single problem and that was the way we had to learn how to solve it this class could have been much easier
2.0,W,lectures are not interesting and she goes through the textbook word for word and does all of the textbook example problems she takes homework questions and works out all of the problems you ask her to the exams are much more difficult than the content she actually teaches
4.0,W,she teaches very fast but if you attend all of her lectures you will be fine for her stat class there are quizzes tests and then a final be sure to review your to make sure they were graded correctly because her ta this year marked several things wrong that were not overall she is very funny and tries to make it fun
3.0,W,a funny professor and will make you laugh but her teaching skills good she moves really fast and cover all the material you see in the textbook her grading is really strict if you take this class consider going to tutoring for extra help
2.0,W,the worst math teacher ever had her tests are insanely hard and your grades are solely based on that picky when it comes to grading tries to be funny and relatable skip class or you know anything
5.0,W,love dr kim park she is very straight to the point there are absolutely no surprises in her class very nice grader too surprisingly a funny professor too you just have to catch her in the right moment use text homework is online very prompt grader i was worried about this class but she made it very basic and easy to understand
5.0,M,professor dilek is a great professor she is very caring and always ready to help she provides study guides and review sessions when possible he has mid term tests she does offer extra credit that involves going on a field trip i would definitely recommend her she is great you regret taking her
5.0,W,professor dilek is a great professor she is very caring and always ready to help she provides study guides and review sessions when possible he has mid term tests she does offer extra credit that involves going on a field trip i would definitely recommend her she is great you regret taking her
5.0,W,the professor explains and lectures on material in a way that can be easily understood she is more than fair with questions grading and extra credit gives great handouts for note taking
5.0,W,awesome teacher this is not an easy class where you show up and get a grade you will have to work for it she offers ec and study guides for the test which are essential show up pay attention take notes work hard complete the work and study for the exams did not need the textbook her notes and power points were detailed enough
5.0,W,she is such a great teacher she literally helps you out with anything you get and makes it easier to understand she gives you all the reviews before exams and finals they can be hard though if you study very nice and helpful teacher would definitely recommend her
4.0,W,i loved this class and this professor it was a hybrid class which meant we only came in once a week for labs and learned the lecture material ourselves i was pretty worried about the labs and dissections but they were actually pretty easy the lecture material too hard to grasp if you read the book great class she offers extra credit
4.0,M,a smart and funny guy he goes off topic here and there but he covers all the information he needs you will actually learn in his class if you like history like him the class is pretty much just lecture with midterms not the easiest class that ever take but also a class made for freshmen
1.0,M,professor reed is a good guy but his lectures tend to drag on and he goes off topic a lot the grading system for this course was wack your grade is made up of midterms and if you mess one up you may as well drop the course definitely go to the ta sessions before the midterms
1.0,M,even understand what his lectures were about follow them it sink in
1.0,M,mr reed is not very good at teaching his lectures drag on and on to the point where it made me decide to just not go to class he loves to go off topic during lectures too your grade is based on essay exams one that is points then the other two are advice go to the ta and si study sessions you learn more there and get to the point
2.0,M,while he may know what he is talking about he talks for so long and brings in so many random references to the lectures such as star trek or his daughter that the important parts become unclear there are only exams for the semester and these are your only grades so be sure to attend the si and ta sessions before each exam
1.0,M,take this class whatever you do professor reed is very intelligent but he rambles about the most random things he brings up glocks and tommy lee jones at least once every lecture you only have three or four grades which are all in class essays the ta si sessions are where you learn and get to the point take econ instead
1.0,W,be prepared to read over pages a week along with all of your other classes also be prepared to write very detailed essays think gonna get by with anything to basic this is a class so the fact that she requires such detailed writing is kind of ridiculous the difficulty of this class rivals many of my upper division courses
4.0,W,this class has a lot of reading so be prepared to stay up to date on the homework but everything assigned is very interesting she is good at grading and responding to messages in a reasonable time i genuinely learned a lot from this class
5.0,M,professor pratt is the best professor that i have ever had at law he cares deeply about his students and you can tell that enjoys teaching he is friendly hilarious and makes even the dull aspects of contract law interesting i wish i was able to take more classes with him as i know he has tremendously improved my legal reasoning
5.0,M,his class is fail proof as long as you turn in all the excel assignments before the final you will be able to get full credit for them that means you probably have to show up for the class his assignments are very detailed which are meant to help you out he tells a lot of jokes and is very sweet only a course
5.0,M,this is an easy pass class and mike is a super nice guy he is always trying to help people and is understanding just miss class because then you have to do the class work at home
5.0,M,nicest professor encountered pass the course if you turn in every assignment overall i would recommend him to anyone and the easiest course taken
5.0,M,he is super caring and actually wants everyone to pass you work through the excel assignments as you need to at your own pace the class is kind of set in a way that the assignments are online and you kinda just sit in class and work on them he has like little sheets you turn in as proof of doing the work
5.0,M,he is honestly one of the sweetest people i have encountered he is so kind and genuine and really cares about his students the class is an easy a and he is a very very good person
5.0,W,i took her for summer online she was easy to get a hold of and has all your work put up the first day just wait till last min to do work she gave plenty of time to do final and quizzes i also had two discussion papers to write that are around paragraphs overall an easy class make sure you do work in a timely manner
3.0,W,i took her online social psych class and the class is just reading the book and doing homework out of it about or chapters w approx assignments eahc due in a month it can be a lot but just pace yourself and do things early and you can get everything done however the stuff that you read is really interesting and eye opening
5.0,M,cute teacher and passionate about what he does easy if you read over lecture notes nice guy
5.0,M,by far my favorite professor at msu he is absolutely brilliant and an overall genuine person he will relate the class material to every day situations which will help you understand it better if you pay attention in class the tests are simple definitely take him
1.0,M,professor caspi was super cool at first but then he did a complete a tough grader and help when is needed does give good feedback but he is no help i learned nothing from the class it was mainly theory and psychologist based which takes a lot to understand but he care if you were confused avoid him if you can
2.0,M,he might be an interesting guy and professor who knows a lot about the subject but definitely not the best professor for immanuel kant his class makes kant more difficult and confusing than it should be
5.0,M,ask for what you need and you shall receive need clarification want to know what the point is want diagrams of how all of philosophy fits together you got it yes reg is famous for his tangents but be interesting funny and thought provoking i highly recommend going to office hours even if you just need someone to talk to
5.0,M,reg is a great professor who is a master at working with students on their own terms where he lacks in organization and simplicity in his explanations he makes up for with his ability to make spontaneous connections to what you are interested in he has an incredibly rich understanding of any reading material because read much of it times
5.0,M,dr burns is the best professor had at texas tech he is very tough on you but once you graduate and you are in the real world you will realize his class is of vital importance his plethora of experiences worked on saturn v professionalism and knowledge of it project management are all used in it world
4.0,M,dr burns has been in the rawls since the building was erected his class can be dry at times but you learn what you need to for your future careers he had a ta that graded our project grammar and we got a lot of points taken off he averages the substance and grammar grades together all in all very difficult work hard and you will do fine
3.0,M,he is a terrific person and a good teacher he cares for his students and does his best to help you lots of homework but you have plenty of time tests were questions the final is questions tests are also pretty difficult with a ton of information to cover but if you study the homework you will be alright answer questions in class for ec
5.0,M,dr burns is a nice professor i love to hear his real life stories lectures are kind of interesting some slides are wordy but you need to read them to pass the test we form one team during semester and deliver many reports so expect to write a lot there are homework sets and closed notes closed books exams overall thump up
2.0,M,he is fine take this course with him if you just want to pass but not to learn to love math of sitting in class and watching him struggle with technology but he is trying to get everyone to pass all midterms are take home you will get an a if you show up and try a little
1.0,M,warning do not take this class dr class is too all over this place his instructions are so unclear he makes basic algebra seem like rocket science he is very rude to his students at times he care if you are on your phone if you have to take him just show up sit in the back and bring headphones
1.0,M,although it was a super easy class he made me hate the subject he rambles on too much and his notes are all over the place he does have a good heart and tries to get his students involved in learning but he yells a bunch attendance mandatory but there is in class quizzes almost every class
5.0,M,take him if possible i loved his class and learned so much only grades though all exams and paper so study but material was explained throughly and in a way youll remember
5.0,M,he is very smart and has a great teaching style he teaches about interesting things that you would want to learn about he is awesome
1.0,M,definitely avoid at all costs i had heard all the terrible things about him and wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt but all true you pass if you give him precisely what he wants to see
4.0,M,okay so the trick with kaminsky is you go to him every chance you get to check your projects if you follow the examples given and he approves of it basically golden otherwise in trouble probably gave me the most anxeity of any professor ever had though
1.0,M,do not take this man if you have the chance avoid at all costs if you get stuck with him be prepared to lose a third of your project grades based on his opinion of your design design it exactly as he has written it or you get no credit no matter how functional says he is available outside of class however he is mostly unhelpful and curt
5.0,M,professor white delivers the best lectures in the computer science department at rit he makes it very clear that he will not waste his students time and teaches until the figurative bell rings his lectures are always clear and follow a logical progression as the semester goes on
1.0,M,he know how to teach and on midterms he asked questions that he did not awful professor
1.0,M,elements with sorry this happened to you do the reading take notes of how the justices argue the topics make categories of the arguments historical textual etc do the questions he gives recurringly for final exam practice attend class he reviews information talk to him after every class about class and write down his views
5.0,M,he is the best professor at um he is smart classes are boring sometimes but it would be good to learn miss practice classes the most important check the outlines and read
1.0,M,nobody knows what he wants to teach in this class there is no syllabus no grading information no battle plan to attack the class his lectures are boring and his sense of humor is lacking and annoying his final is straightforward but no one knows how he grades and how he came up with his inconsistent grades i will avoid him
3.0,W,the class is easy if you just do the supplemental tune up homework to study for the exam as they are exact copies of each other norma herself has some quirky characteristics about her and lecture is like a random dimension and makes no sense just do the homework for the extra credit and you will get an a the final is like the appendix though
5.0,M,one of the easiest classes at mcp as of yet for me would take him again if i could i cannot recommend him enough study the slides and do great on the exams all mc extremely easy a lab is also much easier than freshman bio labs
5.0,M,ned is an easy professor just review the slides before the exam and you will get an a he gives numerous amounts of extra credit if you pay attention in lecture then reviewing be much at all there are old exams and study guides to prepare you easy a
5.0,M,he was a great professor very specific in what is and is not going to be on the exam
5.0,M,awesome professor he made micro interesting such a genuine and funny guy he really cares about his students and does a great job portraying the material all of his lectures are online which helps with exams so much would take him again if my major required me to great dad jokes
3.0,M,we had a paper and a poster which was typical for this class and not horrible made the paper due in the middle of the semester which worked well for me however with assignments and due dates he was inconsistent and changed them frequently i mind getting a later due date but wish he would make up his mind
5.0,M,absolutely loved ned his lectures made the subject so much more bearable than it normally been so funny and his tests are basically his powerpoints i hated the lab but he had nothing to do with that such a great personality gonna miss the guy
4.0,M,lectures are helpful majority of what is covered in lecture will be on the exam he posts study guides past exams to help you prepare for each upcoming exam there are many extra credit opportunities if you take advantage of it something wrong with you
5.0,M,orgo with dr kelley is great he is such a smart man and know just about everything there is to know about orgo if you show up to class then i would suggest watching the lectures if you do either then going to have a hard time trying to pass this class the masteringchemistry homework helps do it
4.0,M,i honestly understand the complains with this guy i very much liked his lectures even though they could be pretty dull especially in the beginning the material is hard no matter what but there are so many oppurtinities for extra help hours and that curve though he curved so incredibly much it was awesome
3.0,M,lectures the best you mainly learn the material by yourself each exam is cumulative first exam not a lot of people finish he curves each exam but if you want to do well in this class you most definitely have to work for it
5.0,M,he is good as long as you expect what the subject entails the course is intended to cover all the basic aspects of database management systems and the professor does a satisfactory job at it he does teach outdated technologies so beware of that also he will make you work hard and cares about the effort you put in the project overall good course
2.0,M,lectures were pretty unclear and his assignments were pretty difficult if it for his extremely lenient grading probably be failing
3.0,M,professor fox is extraordinarily knowledgeable however his lectures are invariably delivered at a pace in a very dry monotone
4.0,M,professor fox is a wonderful person and he is very intelligent he knows what talking about although sometimes the lecture might be a bit boring because he just talk for an hour and occasionally show us images to demonstrate but in general very easy grader and exams are kind of easy too so this is the class to take if you want an easy a
2.0,M,i took class for introduction to human geography and let me tell you he gets so off topic his tests have almost nothing to do with what we learn in class hence you must read the book but overall he is very a easy grader when it comes to papers and tests everyone got an a on our only paper of the semester
4.0,M,avdulov is one of the most caring profs at smu he legitimately cared about your grades your attendance and your happiness in class but his class is difficult extremely difficult required an immense amount of dedication time and effort his grading scheme is vague thought i failed until i saw my grade very stressful
5.0,W,giampetro is the sweetest professor at loyola and her class is probably the best taken she makes the material so interesting and relevant there is a bit of homework but nothing too challenging need the test for the hw but you could split with friends in the class tests are right from class work not too difficult
5.0,W,literally the best professor ever had i still go to her for advice all the time her class was so interesting business law elective she gave us weekly readings and had quizzes which were literally mc qs or one short question pulled directly from the short homework sheets so sweet if you try a little get an a
4.0,M,hes a very intelligent man and he knows his stuff he will push you but as long as you stick with it then you will pass the way he teaches will prepare you for graduate school make sure you do your best and dont procrastinate remember your degree is no free ride dont take anything he assigns for granted and you will be ok
5.0,M,weber is a freaking amazing teacher did his layers of rome trip thought it was going to be a party you go over there to learn i learned more in one month with him than any other professor a tough grader expects a lot from you and is truly one hell of a teacher if you want to learn take this class if you want an easy a keep walking
1.0,M,he expects your to log in at different times to the discussion blog and reply to at least peers with a minimum of words he even grade most of the things he has his ta grade nancy she is a freaking hard grader she does not cut any slack also he assigns a homework assignment every week due on tuesday at get him
1.0,W,he expects your to log in at different times to the discussion blog and reply to at least peers with a minimum of words he even grade most of the things he has his ta grade nancy she is a freaking hard grader she does not cut any slack also he assigns a homework assignment every week due on tuesday at get him
4.0,W,nice prof for exams just study the notes understand everything memorize her tests are more applying what you learned than memorizing but very doable if you study while studying think of examples of the content and how you can write about things talked about the semester long group project sucks if you have a bad group
2.0,W,a sweet lady but about the only upside unfortunately she is also one of the worst lecturers ever had spends an insane amount of time talking about inconsequential things and flying through more complicated parts exams are not only more complicated than anything you do in class but also worded vaguely avoid her if you can
4.0,W,week summer course only take this class if you absolutely need to there is a ton of homework that averages about hours a night mcgraw hill based connect do all the practice the tests are hard but not if you study all the content the last two exams are challenging she provides powerpoints with her speaking professor did all she could
5.0,W,she is my favorite accounting professor at unlv
1.0,W,excessive work and a waste of time learned more from professors at csn than from this woman sua connect homework networking events and not enough time for exams she comes to class smiling but a smile welcoming you to hell also get ready to spend money on class materials not worth it
4.0,W,super hard class but she was a great prof
4.0,W,she co-taught the class with dr melendez as a result i believe most people compare her to melendez that being said many dislike her because she doesnt spoon feed you everything that you need to know for the tests which melendez does but if youre willing to pay attention during lecture and actually work a little for the class a great prof
2.0,W,by far the hardest class ever taken this class was so hard i studied all the time lecture is all over the place and it makes it very hard to take good notes very scatterbrained and her lecture is confusing with the powerpoint she makes she help you very much in the lab wish i could explain some more but i ran out
4.0,W,she is the sweetest professor she is kind of difficult but if you listen and study you will be fine
5.0,W,cynthia really makes sure you know she is there to help you at anytime she even came to our study group on a sunday in her personal time she expects you to work at learning not just show up anyone saying a bad professor willing to put the work in tests are a little tricky be careful
5.0,W,cynthia play she expects you to pre-read the material before coming to class each day then in class she expects participation she will ask you questions she tries to guide u to the answer but is often confusing how she does it she was very helpful outside of class she seems intimidating but is truly a kind soul ask she will help
5.0,W,i loved cynthia and the way she taught her class she lets you know there for you the whole way through you definitely float through cell biology because not an easy subject but if you do the work as she suggests and participate in class be fine so passionate about what she teaches a truly awesome professor
3.0,W,professor zacate is the type of professor where her instructions are pretty vague so you need to make sure to ask as many questions as you need to to get things cleared up she gives out a lot of writing assignments which work towards the ten paged paper at the end of the semester for extra credit she also explain the chapters often
3.0,W,prof dearing a bad teacher things to note about her class absences bring you down a letter grade being late by minutes times counts as an absence the final paper accepted late not even later that day she teaches grammar and essay structure if you want to read poems and analyze symbolism this the class for you
4.0,W,she takes off a final letter grade for every classes missed so skip too offen her quizzes are easy grade boosters and she teaches pretty straight to the book if bad at english you might struggle a little bit however a hardass and though her expectations are clear she grades tough i would take her again if i had to
1.0,W,this is the worst teacher at hvcc do not take her class she is not a good teacher at all she does not help she does not give any good advise drinks coffee and chocolate bars all class grades really tough my friend told me to drop her before school started and i should have listened absolute worst there
5.0,M,christian is like a wizard it takes him months to teach what the math department takes courses profs and months to teach poorly truly magical
1.0,W,kristine is one of the worst professors had incredibly full of herself and teaches her opinions like fact also technologically illiterate and wastes time trying to figure out the simplest things tests have confusing questions and she expects us to teach ourselves the material outside of class avoid
5.0,M,dr tompkins teaches for understanding not memorization come to class participate and pay attention hi lecture videos are exactly what he taught in class so if you understand something watch it until you get it his quizzes are short but difficult i cannot stress enough how important coming to class and paying attention are
5.0,M,genuinely difficult professor to navigate but that is mostly because he tries to make sure you understand the material which his quizzes and exams directly reflect do not bother skipping class because he teaches directly from his powerpoints and will quiz you accordingly really tried and still made a yeah and he round up either
5.0,M,great professor taking him in the summer is more difficult to manage tho would recommend him for regular semesters
4.0,M,tompkins is a very good teacher who cares about you understanding not memorizing the material his youtube videos are extremely helpful but his tests and quizzes are extremely challenging and quite difficult he does not care about your grade and makes it nearly impossible to get an a in his class too much information to learn for a week clas
1.0,M,this prof cares more about hearing himself talk than your education my peers busted their butts for and the b is with a curve on exams show him exactly the way he shows you if not you are wrong the biggest barrier to your success will be giving tompkins what he wants the way he wants it not learning the material
4.0,M,he is not that hard if you just want to pass quizzes are of your grade but they are only few questions each he grades purely on the curve his teaching style is to give you a solid understanding of the material which enables you to pass any test he throws at you he has lectures on youtube which really help very light workload
4.0,M,really great and caring teacher offers videos of all lectures so that you can study he wants you to understand the material and is always willing to meet for extra help prefers to call you on the phone to answer questions over emailing tough grader but completely fair
4.0,M,good prof cares and gives you multiple opportunities to succeed always willing to answer questions outside of class my first class with him tests are hard but watch the videos go to class and pay attention because it helps you learn definitely would take him again not an easy class though
5.0,M,professor tony hage is an amazing instructor i strongly recommended him very passionate explains in detail making complex info easy to understand shwd short cut go above and beyond to help students plenty of reviews materials available before after class labs a final overall an excellent professor i would take him agai
4.0,W,mary is overall a good teacher you do not need the textbook just the lab manual we almost never had lab or lecture even though we are supposed to she gives out occasional extra credit ask questions if you have any because she is not the best at explaining things for the practicals i would recommend using quizlet to help you study
5.0,W,mary is straight forward she only teaches the material necessary quizzes are from lab activities done in groups so attendance is important to get these points as long as you do the work and study you will do well she has a great sense of humor and i really liked her teaching style i feel i learned what i needed to
1.0,W,this professor has a tendency to get off topic incredibly easy she is a very nice and funny person but scatter brained is saying it nicely be prepared to teach yourself a lot on your own time lecture heavy with little hands on learning
5.0,W,dr brown is a great professor she does tend to get off topic often but funny and cares a lot about her students passing i wait to take another class with her
2.0,W,very disorganized will waste your time for sure with odd musings and unrelated tangents makes it very clear how little she knows often behind on material uses the lab time to make up lecture time give the big picture so you will have to teach yourself the material on the upside the exams are pretty easy if you use study guide
4.0,W,dr brown is a great professor anatomy is a very challenging course be she makes it enjoyable and understandable this was my second time around taking anatomy and with dr brown as a professor i passed with a b make sure to keep up with notes provided the greatest tool to passing this course is reviewing and using online lab tutorials
5.0,M,amazing teacher i would definetly take him again lectures are easy to follow and never boring
5.0,M,fina with him is considered a capstone fina course be solving cases and presenting throughout the semester extremely useful for finance students looking to apply what they have learned a very demanding course but be ready for the workforce thereafter he used to manage a multi billion hedge fund the best prof w expe
5.0,M,take class if you like group projects or presenting in front of class the group project very difficult but you will learn a lot as well his lectures are hilarious but the group presentations are often tedious very respected teacher and will listen to you his exams are very fair as well
1.0,M,worst teacher i had in jmsb he teach you anything and care about his students you know how he grades you sent him emails to review my exams he never replied horrible teacher
5.0,M,very smart guy and lenient with grading show up to class very often although i kept up with the homework and stayed on top of my stuff even though it might be hard to understand him at times definitely recommend him
5.0,M,one of the most knowledgeable and helpful professors i have had at grand valley i would recommend taking any class that he teaches
5.0,M,great professor bio really my thing but his sense of humor and stories he would tell related to class topics made class more interesting really cares about students and definitely wants to make sure we all succeed have picked a better professor
5.0,W,i learned so much from taking this class and i really enjoyed it she gives ppt lectures and provides links to articles and videos to help with the lecture she truly cares about her students success just do the reading take notes keep up with the discussions and wou will do well in the tests
5.0,W,i learned so much in this class at first it was overwhelmingly but she gives you linked learning to videos and her lecture notes with examples i found it fascinating that i not only understood about the developing child and adolescence but about myself i loved the inspirational messages and reminders that she included in her announcements
3.0,W,test day is a nightmare she is very concerned with making sure it is done correct which is fine but she can come across as very rude about it she touched my arm and lifted my sleeve to look for a watch the tests that bad honestly the paper was more difficult for me she is very specific about apa format so be careful with that
1.0,W,ida seems like a great nurse get me wrong however her class sucks her tests are ridiculously hard and her lectures are extremely boring she reads straight off the powerpoint so i not even shown up for class but had to the exams are all definitions of basically the same words i hate that this class is a pre-nursing class
1.0,W,these pre-nursing classes were the reason i decided nursing was not for me your grade is dependent almost entirely on exams and a final the tests are ridiculous with definitions and random questions over apa format and god knows what she walks around and stands over you while you test she is the only option but i would not recommend
3.0,W,you can tell from class that dr slusher is definitely a good nurse and knows the information she is teaching however she is very tough to please in class her tests are the hardest out of the pre-nursing classes all the answers can be right but you have to pick the one that is the most right you definitely have to work for your grade
2.0,W,ida you can tell she is an amazing nurse and an even better woman you can tell outside of class she is very nice but in class is different during exams she puts tissues in your face takes your jacket and once made me move my arm because i guess i could be cheating the class is hard dont get me wrong but it is definitely doable study
4.0,W,dr slusher deserves a lot more credit than most people give her she is someone i look up to for her accomplishments in nursing she is a professor that cares about the future of nursing and wants you to succeed slusher will prepare you for the rest of your nursing program and career lecture heavy funny intelligent has high expectations
3.0,W,as this professor was the only professor teaching the course i had no option but to take her class she seems to mean well and sure she is well respected in the nursing world but it was impossible to meet with her one on one and she failed to email me back a few times be prepared to study and pay attention in class or you will not pass
4.0,W,she is a great grader if you hand in a paper shell correct it and hand it back then you fix it and give it to her youll pass she only uses your top paper and test grades and gets rid of the other ones
1.0,W,does not use canvas very unorganized loses papers does not know what to do unclear instructions no drop boxes no grades online even say our grades when we ask you will know by the end of the semester is what she says very unfair what if someone is failing also does not reply any emails very not recommended waste of and time
1.0,M,dr horn has a very unique teaching style in short he really teach everything you need to know will come from the textbook the in-class activities will just confuse you and waste your time his tests are super vague and hardly reflect what was learned this class does not prepare you for later chemistry courses find another teacher
1.0,M,literally the worst teacher ever had do not take his class the average on every test was below a percent i studied everyday for at least hours the tests relevant to anything you learn in class he teach you anything i ended up with a percent in the class and he round up to a b for me
1.0,M,literally the worst teacher ever had do not take his class the average on every test was below a percent i studied everyday for at least hours the tests relevant to anything you learn in class he teach you anything i ended up with a percent in the class and he round up to a b for me
1.0,M,do not take him he is more worried about his group study than the students the average on the final was and that is considering the curve i ended up with around on the final and i ended with a b the tests are only question each so if you miss your already below he lectured for a total of a couple hours in the semester
4.0,W,i really enjoyed dr class she has amazing lectures that are based on her life experience and she is hilarious but beware miss her class or your grade will go down she takes attendance every day and will notice if you are absent be careful and always turn in assignments on syllabus even if she does not ask for them on due date
3.0,W,professor richard is seen as one of the most difficult teachers when i took this class i felt like it was hard to focus because we rarely stayed on task you definitely have to read the books and attendance is mandatory she grades super hard but i feel like if you actually try your end grade will be acceptable
1.0,W,do yourself a huge favor choose richards she is extremely unorganized in her lectures rambles about nonsense for the first min of the class and then expects you to have actually learned something class is out of pts w pop quizzes worth the final paper which you put hours and hours into worth makes no sense unfair
2.0,W,although this was an easy class prof pam occasionally went off topic throughout her lectures and was sometimes confusing to follow you have to show up to class just read the books and complete the essays online assignments online assignments are so just try to do them and get the easy points last daydonuts so
5.0,W,one of the easiest classes i have ever taken i know how anyone ended up with less than an a in this class really do all the work and show up to class and you get an a study for exams they are very easy too she is super smart and a harvard alumni even though she never mentioned it because she is super humble amazing professor
5.0,W,eisberg is amazing very enthusiastic and easy going professor and is always available to help she tends to ramble though spend minutes answering a yes or no question but take her again as long as you go to class and do the homework and online quizzes pass and a few extra credit opportunities
5.0,W,maria was the sweetest professor i have ever had she was super flexible and understands that life happens sometimes sometimes was not super clear about criteria but was fairly assessable outside of the classroom absolutely adored her and wished i done with my psych requirements to take more classes with her i took her at the rcc campus
5.0,W,great wants you to succeed will help you if you ask for extra credit very good lectures and good study guides followed her for my bio major prereqs she likes you to be involved in discussion on the topics on the subjects of the day love the team group testing gives the chance to build up grade best teach ever for psych
5.0,W,great professor must rent textbook to receive participation points on the online discussions participation grade weighs a lot she likes to know you are reading the assignments and quoting from the actual book she does offer extra credit via essay only need to write essays for online class apa style great at replying back to emails
5.0,W,took this class online and it was an easy a if anyone a psych major and wishes to just knock this class out of the way i would recommend taking online it saved me alot of time all you need to do is reply to these forums once a week and you had papers due throughout the whole semester and they were easy she responds fast to emails
3.0,W,i love mrs fitzpatrick psych very caring a bit of a calling in sick but if you voice your concerns to her she will help you pick up grade funny her tests do match her exams a lot of reading she lets you use a cheat sheet on test easy a very accessible on line and in office overall very relaxed happy all the time
1.0,W,grades papers kind of hard lots of group work such a big class the students screwed around so much that you could never hear the lecture at some point you need to tell the class to quiet down some of us were actually there to learn she was often in her own little world really seem to care about what she teaches
1.0,W,fitzpatrick is a total valley girl that sounds like she has a grade education class was really boring watched old movies from the that teach us anything had to write several papers a stickler for apa format overrated if you ask me
1.0,W,very part of our grade is visiting her during her office hours she said that if we have any s that we still needed to show up to say hi she also let the class decide when papers will be due after giving suggested dates after an hour of everyone arguing we ended up dates as orig more papers than english class
1.0,W,most lectures are half lecture half movie not very specific on what you need to be paying attention to beware she will not reply back to your emails feedback for our research paper rough draft was given back to us days before the final draft was due she makes you take all the tests twice for a chance to do better but its not worth it
4.0,W,several small papers required and a final page apa style research paper her exams cover a lot of material but she works with you to get a better grade
2.0,W,she took over the half of my socialpsych class i had her for intro to psych and it was a waste of time her classes are why millenials think owed something write all your answers on her allowed cheat sheets and do assignments and you get an a if felt like an insult to the students who actually want to be challenged and earn grades
2.0,W,her lecture is really boring she use a lot of boring video long long time ago information she offer a lot extra credit if you did them you will get a good grade it is hard to learning something through her lecture
4.0,M,professor tjandra was great he explains everything thoroughly and in an easy way to try to remember it is a lot of work includes homework assignments exercise worksheets quizzes tests and lab work i however did not put my full effort so i will probably be failing the class but will retake him soon after because he really is great
4.0,W,lots of reading followed by class discussion over material you know ahead of time exactly what is expected for assignments so if you want to actually learn and participate in class do the reading if not do the readings when the assigned papers are due with the least bit of effort you can get a great grade she is lecture heavy
3.0,W,need to show up to class she gives random participation days and takes attendance every day reports are easy as long as you skim the material
5.0,W,i absolutely loved this class i showed up for every class session you have to unless you have a friend who is willing to give you the notes since she does not post powerpoints online she goes in depth and you actually learn the subject matter the tests are literally based on the notes and questions from the study guide overall she is great
3.0,W,she seemed a little nutty at times but super caring and sweet i pay attention in her class and still managed to get an a
5.0,M,spears was an amazing prof he genuinely cares about the students and tries to remember the names of all of the students in order to develop a more personal relationship go out of his way to help you and definitely makes lectures interesting always up for a discussion during class which allows students to gain more knowledge
5.0,M,hour seminar quiz every class pages of tough marker that all being said it was genuinely a privilege to be in ian spears year class it is the most eye opening provocative and inspirational course at guelph he cares about his students and wants them to think critically about every reading take this class
5.0,M,ian speers is a amazing prof the reason considering to be politics prof in future really inspiring and helpful in class however he encourages to read and attend to classes a lot so if not interested you might have a hard time
5.0,W,professor sweely is one of my absolute favorite human beings she is so full of knowledge and you can tell she loves her job she even makes lectures about thousand year old art interesting the only down fall of the class is that there are only about grades for the whole year so you must do well on all of them relatively easy a
5.0,W,i love dr sweely she is the best professor i have ever had i learned so much from her about art and life too take every class you can with her i left her class with a huge smile on my face every day she is a shining star
5.0,M,professor mccauley is the best professor i have had york he posts his powerpoints which makes it easy when studying for the mid term and the final after taking this class with him i switched my major to sociology if you have a chance to take a clas with him take it he is knowledgeable and definitely knows what he is talking about
1.0,M,worst prof ever had in years at york believe me i studied i went to every class lecture i even went to the writing department for help and i still managed to get a c on my papers very unfair everyone gets the same presentation mark stay far away if you want to pass great course he just taught nothing to do with the course
5.0,W,if you strive to do more than just learn the material you will average out she is a professor who is passionate and therefore has high expectations prepares you for the real world
4.0,M,dr fisher is really funny undoubtedly very knowledgable but he lectures extremely fast i recommend rewatching tegrity for his lectures because he often elaborates on his slideshows says things not written down but that he will test you on on the tests he usually never takes questions directly from his hw he rewords them
5.0,M,not too shabby enjoyed him
1.0,W,worst spanish teacher ever a fluent spanish speaker and i failed her class she does not know how to teach spanish in a way beginners would understand i bought the textbook and never used it i had to correct her multiple times during class to dont take her class
1.0,W,take this class the feeling you get on the first day that tells you maybe to drop it and take something else listen to that because by mid semester if you are a beginner you will be buried with the course work and she give you the help you need
1.0,M,even if you follow his feedback it help future grades unnecessarily harsh in general communication that being said all work was online have to go to campus for anything so a huge plus if it for the feedback issues and his attitude toward students rate higher and consider taking again tough but doable
3.0,M,tons of homework and a fair amount of reading each week definitely a harsh grader but he usually tells you what missing not the greatest personality mind and certainly intimidating but been a year since taken his class and the information has actually stuck overall difficult but worth taking
1.0,M,never actually explains what he wants he will fail your assignments and not give clear feedback as to what he actually expects from you quiz journals and groupwork due each week rude and extremely unhelpful
5.0,M,almost finished with my ba in history i really like to reflect upon my history class with prof timmons he is tough but you will rarely find another prof as knowledgeable i would recommend him to anyone who is serious about history or simply enjoys actual learning and is not afraid to work for it
2.0,M,we had two papers a podcast to listen and respond to and reading every week told everyone upfront to expect hours of work gives commentary back for each assignment however several times i noticed a confusing response and grade and upon reaching out he got my work confused with another student you have to be on top of your grades
5.0,M,a pretty dorky teacher but super nice his lectures are interesting however i suggest focusing on the book for tests quizzes etc open note quizzes and exams the journal question are rather difficult and can become overwhelming overall great teacher easy class
5.0,W,i took her online us literature i course and it was pretty straight forward dr class is well organized she grades essays fast and responds to email in a timely manner there is a lot of reading not too much though but this is a literature course so to be expected
5.0,W,american literature after is the second of two classes i took with professor lape this summer i greatly enjoyed this class because she helped me grow as a writer i especially like how she lets students pick the topics of their essays related to the assigned readings and approved by her i would reccomend that anyone take a class with her
5.0,W,i took two online classes with professor lape this summer and i wish i could take more i greatly enjoyed this class covering literature participation is in the form of blackboard posts covering that readings papers are returned with great feedback within a few days of submission i became better writer because of her
5.0,W,professor lape has been one of my favorite professors ever taken two courses with her and wish i could take more she encourages discussion of different view points and is incredibly supportive the best part is her feedback every paper i turn in is returned promptly which is rare with a grade and in depth feedback throughout my paper
5.0,W,professor lape is such a sweet lady she helps you understand the readings the next day you come into class by discussing with everyone there are not many grades attendance does matter to her one group project which could go either way based on the group you choose to be with the exams are a little rough to study for but you do well
5.0,M,dr perkins is the best professor i have had at acu i am currently a macc student and he still goes back and reviews the basics with us he believes strongly in understanding the fundamentals of accounting his class is not hard if you pay attention in class and do the homework he also makes himself very available to his students
5.0,M,in order to succeed in this class you must do the homework and read the chapters at least glance the vocabulary the exams are exactly like the study guides he gives with a few questions he also provides tutoring sessions in case a student has trouble in this class
1.0,M,i was excited to take his sex in the city one program and the first term was okay but the second he just piggy backed off of the other one program profs and had very little to do with sexual diversity he care for his students opinions or mental health and though some of the readings and trips were good an overall disappointment
1.0,M,the worst professor ever come across in my years at u of t i would give him a but it is not possible right from the get go his ego is apparent he does what suits him and to heck about anyone else because of course the universe revolves around him sad and i pity him save your money and time and take a course with a better prof
5.0,W,geri is a very nice down to earth prof like a sweet grandma there is definitely a lot of work to do but she grades easy as long as you do it show a little effort do fine a little unorganized at times failed to mention in there was a page final memoir paper lots of small group sharing fun artsy class
5.0,W,used point system to get an a we needed pts she offered pts tests and must get to consider getting a no final small quizzes in between not required but if you want pts then take it you can fail the quizzes and it wont matter bc its point based posts ppt lectures after class i did so much extra work than i needed to
5.0,W,very passionate about what she teaches have to buy tophat for participation point based system to get an a you have to get points she offered points her quizzes are online but very short in so no time to use very easy to get a if you just pay attention
4.0,M,even though we are slightly past midterms i have thoroughly enjoyed his class when i decided to take his class many people told me not to take it but he is very personable the best way to pass his class is to write down on the board and then refer back to the book to take more in depth notes i will definitely be taking his class again
2.0,W,if thinking about taking this professor save yourself a headache and she makes sure that impossible you get an a she lectures every single class rambles the entire time she expects you to talk in discussion to get your grade assigns ch plus other readings to do every night insane work for gen ed
4.0,W,dr spock is an incredibly nice person and seems to genuinely care about her students succeeding that said the class is harder than you would expect its a lot of dense reading and she lectures the full class sometimes a couple minutes after but the tests impassable if a history major take her but if not find someone easier
1.0,W,feth is the worst professor ever had she refuses to use blackboard so you have to constantly hound her if you want to know about your grades she does treat you like stupid the textbook for this course is useless she uses old activities that are copied so many times they are not even legible she is incredibly arrogant without reason
4.0,W,chem is hard to begin with but mcgill teaches it well she have the traditional powerpoint with bulletpoints so really going to have to do her worksheets and pay attention do all resources mentors office hours etc i had friends in heaven who had basically the same test as us but they never really learned the material
1.0,W,do not take this class unless you can teach yourself she does not curve and is unapproachable do not believe the stuff other people say this class ruins your gpa and she has it out for pre med students i went to epass never missed class studied hrs a week if you took ap chem and are smart take this class if not avoid it at all cost
2.0,W,so not actually a pre-med kid or even in stem at emory but i do spend a lot of time in the organic chemistry side of things and from what seen a nice person but her tests are insane not worth it ruin your gpa freshman year take literally any other gen chem prof you regret it
5.0,W,she is a really good lecturer but she goes so fast hard to grasp the concepts if you have no time to process so i wish she recorded her lectures or something her tests are pretty hard so if you want to a good gpa go take another professor other professors are relatively easier
3.0,W,really nice and gives good lectures but she gives really hard tests that will kill your gpa
5.0,W,exhibits a genuine love for chemistry and cares so much for her students and canadian so learn a lot about that if you take her class a definite plus
5.0,W,amazing really helps you understand the concepts of general chemistry with a little bit of organic mixed in she made me a chemistry major go to chem mentors and do the class worksheets and not hard to get an a
4.0,W,dr mcgill is very sweet and willing to help if needed her office hours are very helpful the content is difficult but reading and chem mentors really helps for fall mcgill and williams will be the only ones with experience teaching the new course chem so take them
3.0,W,dr mcgill is a great professor i really liked how she taught however the orgo material is extremely challenging so beware the incorporation of orgo really made me work for my grade btw she is very unwilling to curve your final grade make sure to work hard in the beginning to get grades that can help you when the material gets hard
5.0,W,i had dr mcgill for chemistry and and her courses this year were the pilot courses for the new chemistry and semester course she did an amazing job of creating the new curriculum and taught it amazingly she cares so much about her students and was so helpful during office hours take her if you want a good grade
5.0,W,she was an amazing professor who really took time to listen to her students the class will require reading and includes a lot of organic chemistry as this semester she taught the pilot curriculum which is becoming the new chemistry it is a lot more focused on fewer topics and will help to prepare students for organic chemistry for sure
3.0,W,dr mcgill is very nice but her class can be very challenging she offers extra credit for groups if the group average is above an the class consists mostly of group work on worksheets rather than actual lecture it was sometimes unclear what chapters we should be reading generally we ran out of time before we could go over worksheets
2.0,M,dr class is really hard to pay attention to because he talks very quietly and is not very engaging he also grades pretty tough too but its not a bad class
1.0,M,often hard to understand because he is constantly mumbling and even confuses himself on various topics
4.0,M,quick question quiz every friday of your grade is participation dont bother buying the textbook i never opened mine for any open ended question he asks in class answer it depends of the time be right midterm and final are questions very similar to the quizes take clear notes
4.0,M,no textbook necessary for this class ghorashi lectures the entire class which can be boring but he is very clear and always asks if everyone understands because all test and quizzes are based on notes taken during lecture he revisits previous lessons at the beginning of class a quiz every week midterm and final rarely any homework
5.0,M,professor thielen is an amazing person he gives good feed back and his presentations are very informative you really only need the book to for a few questions on the tests that reference his slides i took this class online and had a blast if you need to take a communications class take this class with this professor you regret it
5.0,W,best professor i have probably had at niu really cares about the success of her students and will go beyond to try to explain something you have to work for an a but you actually learn a lot in this class
4.0,M,prof yager is overall a good teacher he can be slightly intimidating esp when in a small class but he tries hard to make connections with his students there is homework every night but it is never too lengthy or difficult just be sure to fully read the lecturas skim because the info will show up again on pop quizzes and exams
5.0,M,after taking with professor yager i took with him a year later based almost entirely on the fact that he was teaching it his class is relatively entertaining and he is great at connecting with his students genuinely cares about the well-being of his students and understands the students perspectives
5.0,M,i had him once a week for trig at night it was not a good time but he made the class lively you really have to work for a good grade but he gives easy and useful extra credit it much but it could bring your test up a letter grade loves interacting with his students will talk to you at least once
5.0,M,very great teacher hes goofy and out there which is different from the average teacher he makes up funny sayings and tries his best to relate math with real world examples i was never bored in his class he picks on everyone so beware and pay attention at all times i would definitely recommend him i wish i could take him for stats
5.0,M,always been bad at math and after failing college algebra the first time i never thought be able to pass this class bob young cares about students and offers extra credit amazing study tools online and in person and other helpful tips throughout without his hilarious and effective teaching methods i of passed this class
4.0,M,i am terrible at math yet i finished this course with an a this was an online course all assignments were open from day of the semester so that students could work ahead extra credit opportunities for every tests professor young wants his students to succeed if you struggle in math he will get you through
5.0,M,prof young is awesome he really cares about math and his students he offers extra credit on canvas so be sure to do that for some gimme points be sure to do the homework each week and his tests really that difficult as long as you practice young makes math fun and is very funny you will definitely enjoy his class
5.0,M,recommend him enough go for it
5.0,M,professor leatham is not your typical professor he talks a lot during his lectures but he makes it fun and interesting he had two exams and they were based on his lectures and on the readings his exams were of our grade he gave a lot of extra credit
1.0,M,his test have nothing to do with what he leactures about if you can call it lecturing our final was about question long he tries to stand and deliver the class but fails miserably there is no organization this class is not hard but it adds so much stress to your life basically in limbo the whole time with your grade stay away
1.0,M,all he does is yell at us i am a bio chem student in calc obviously am good at studying and following the rules but he makes the class so much harder just finished his class and i am still confused at what he actually taught he is jumbled on his exams number on a scantron not sure which one to answer and he updates nothing
1.0,M,his assignments are the definition of busy work not a hard class but time consuming rude for a college professor you do not know your grade until the end and when you ask he will give you some long story about how grades do not matter use his own website which he never updates i do not recommend taking him
3.0,M,dr lynn is a very engaging speaker but sometimes he is not always appropriate during a lecture on ethics he made us pull out our phones and show him our facebook pages he said he wanted to check them for ho pictures it is not his business what we do on our personal time this was during a lecture on ethics
5.0,W,prof sue is the best professor i have ever had she is so willing to go out of her way to help students and make sure they succeed you have to write word papers each class but they become pretty routine and are simple she is very knowledge but you have to come to class ready to discuss and listen i would definitely recommend her
5.0,M,very good professor his lecture is really interesting and he cares about his students have any question just ask him be sure to attend class and read his notes almost all of the test question come from his notes if your answer is really good he will give you extra mark
1.0,M,lets just say his lectures are a perfect example of diminishing marginal utility and my grade perfectly resembled an economies of scale graph
4.0,M,i had hammond for micro in fall term and macro in winter term i thought he was a good prof and was able to get good marks in both classes however after a year it looks like that has all changed as i was reading all the comments for the fall micro term just goes to show how can differ year to year just be careful
1.0,M,what can i say except for the fact that his disgrace of a professor told his students that going to intentionally make the average between most unreasonable prof who expects you to teach of the material yourself seriously go f yourself bruce
1.0,M,funny thing that everyone is complaining about him this year i definitely agree based on my experience in first year he is indeed heartless and does not care about his students
1.0,M,i regret coming to western because of this man not only is he an awful teacher but he is a terrible person we pay all this money to get an education we put endless ours of studying in and no matter how hard you try you will not do well because he purposely wants his students to fail because of him i now have a negative outlook on western
1.0,M,for the final exam i read the entire textbook did all suggested problems went over the first two exams completely and all in all probably spent hours studying all of that was for nothing as the final exam was insane and unfair and it seems like bruce want anyone in his course to do well would recommend switching out of his class
1.0,M,the only concept i learned in his class was the idea of diminishing return well he sure did a great job of helping us understand it in real life by making the class average exponentially lower each time we write the test
1.0,M,worst prof ever he doesnt care about his students lives i sometime question his true intentions
4.0,W,two things heavy reading and group projects though all of this in preparation for upcoming tests again the course mainly consists of heavy reading group projects tests and observation projects at the nvc child development center smyle is very lively and is understanding she is willing to help if you are confused with any of the readings
5.0,M,mr charlesworth is the best he is hilarious and knows so much about space if been daydreaming about the unknown take his class an easy a if you show up and do the work you have to study for the final or you may not pass he is available outside of class to help you if struggling as well
5.0,W,tenger is my favorite she is very accessible outside of class and genuinely wants you to succeed not just in her class but in life she is a pretty easy grader if you do what she wants she gives tons of handouts with exactly what she wants you to improve on actually a really nice person though she may seem intimidating at first
5.0,M,one of the best professors i have ever had the best i have had at plu so far great learning experience always engaging class sessions with fun content and awesome guest speakers really helped me do well in class obviously he cares for his students even wrote a recommendation for me would highly recommend taking any of his courses
5.0,W,professor luther is by far one of the best professors had during my tenure she will teach you the skills to not only do well in school but also excel in the industry she will meet with students on her off hours and weekends and has a great sense of pride in her students accomplishments highly recommend her for this and any other courses
1.0,W,finance is a hard topic generally speaking but she made a lot more difficult than it needed to be in class she would teach us basics like what is and the tests and homework would be more like find the circumference of the sun and how long it would take us to get there do not take if you can get any other professor do it
3.0,W,was definitely a hard class but you will learn a lot she teaches at a fast pace and takes attendance every class assigns a lot of homework but check it until the end of the semester for extra credit you will need the textbook she assigns homework from it and quizzes us on chapter reading for participation points
5.0,W,best professor ever she genuinely cares about giving you an education instead of just helping you simply pass the class she is funny when necessary and is all around such a great human being if you respect her and listen to her lectures and do your work you will pass definitely will take this class again over
4.0,W,she is tough wants you to participate to help you understand finance she really cares about you learning and getting something out of class last semester she started using online resources which made some of the homework easier
5.0,W,she was very caring and enjoyable to be around be doing class time partially online each week through the series of videos she provides some are pretty silly for sure crack a smile each project is challenging in its own way but be wary of going too big with your ideas all very time sensitive
5.0,W,kathy haddad is one of the best professors at chaffey college she is so sweet and truly cares for her students this class is not hard just do your weekly readings in the textbook usually about pages and take the quizzes every week two short research papers very easy and some discussion forums which were very minimal recommend
5.0,M,i took social problems as well as criminology and i thoroughly enjoyed both classes david is a very straightforward get-straight-to-the-point professor so class definitely got depressing sometimes he does not sugarcoat anything which i believe helps us learn concepts better overall i would highly recommend taking his classes
4.0,M,hyde is a really cool guy and always has interesting stories to share he is super smart and intellectual to the point where kind of intimidating some of the time when people raised their hands he would kind of shut down their ideas but for the most part he is really nice super easy homework he takes attendance once a week
5.0,M,one my favorite professors so far very lecture heavy but his lectures are always interesting and he throws in some personal stories as well only assigns one assignment a week but quick and easy and the final is open book
5.0,M,probably the best professor had he really cares about his students and really prides in his lectures in addition his lectures are all available online just for anyone to use the assignments he gave were easy all you really need to do is attend his classes and all set plus his stories are great his final was easy take it
4.0,M,great professor and has interesting lectures although he lacks group projects and even though his lectures are interesting if you love listening to lectures they can get kinda boring tip for the test go to his lecture notes on canvas and hit on your keyboard an open test so you can do word search on notes to get the answers
5.0,M,professor hyde is awesome i learned so much from his criminology class there was barely any homework and the tests were really easy if you paid attention and took notes in class he lectured most of the time but he was not boring about it he told a few personal stories i would recommend for any class
5.0,M,jason is the best seriously value every second you have with him hes wonderful
4.0,M,this class was really easy potter is an easy teacher and there was hardly any work for the class the only downside is you see your grade because he use canvas but you can always ask for it
4.0,M,his grading is based on attendance oral presentation midterm with essay and final essay prompts are given week in advance to prepare for the oral presentation is based on a single question off of the reading its really easy
4.0,M,professor potter is a really good and caring professor he goes through his lectures at a good pace to make sure you get what you need the only downside is that your graded on few things but as long as you study hard its a great class to take
5.0,M,honestly the best teacher out there i am so glad i took him his grading is pretty easy as well he does try to help his students out by giving a practice test before the actual test hes a very understanding and wonderful teacher
4.0,M,his grading is based on attendance oral presentation midterm with essay and final essay prompts are given week in advance to prepare for the oral presentation is based on a single question off of the reading its really easy go to his class his exams are based on lectures
5.0,M,youre going to read a lot he is not easy he also doesnt tolerate slackers in other words the real deal for a professor i pay for a dumbed down education blitz takes students seriously and demands a lot and what you should want only been weeks and this is already my favorite class then again here to learn
2.0,M,get ready to read alot we basically read articles that were pointless throughout the semester and got quizzed on them blitz is also a confusing guy he may seem like an intelligent guy but he often goes too far with the point making and totally loses you avoid if possible
1.0,M,horrible he just reads off the slides and talks to the board he has a thick accent so you can barely understand him
5.0,M,taken fall i was so happy to have a professor like him in my first semester of college he is hilarious fun to work with we did research which was super fun my class got to do research on sex work comparing different groups of people
5.0,M,excellent professor online class easy a wish he taught more classes online
3.0,W,there is books to read in this class and every single class period you have a quiz the quizes are of your grade so if you are not willing to do the readings do not take this class then she is nice and respected but can be rude when people are rude we only have one paper to do in that class and for the final you had to come finals week
1.0,W,professor larkin is one of the rudest professors at john jay very sarcastic rude and mean in her comments on work submitted avoid her at all costs
4.0,W,dr dogru always had well planned out packets to give us however we basically had to learn the material in groups before she would teach us how to do it she was very sweet and was always available for office hours she put homework grades in until the end so i thought i was getting a c when i really ended up with an a
1.0,W,literally the worst professor at grand valley if you like actually learning calc take her
2.0,W,very unclear when teaching and explaining not very good at explaining things in a different way test are super hard and she puts problems way harder and more complex than anything we do in class or have had as homework only goes over homework about half the time
1.0,W,she is easily the worst professor ever had and i am a junior she has people essentially teach themselves every lesson or she teaches a lesson then gets tired and stops zero feedback on any graded item forces you to use webwork a completely outdated program that is horrible in every way lazy poorly put together and generally terrible
1.0,W,she explain things very well laughs when someone has a wrong answer or do their homework exams are nothing like done in class or for homework difficult to study for better off using online videos to teach yourself only goes over easy examples in class and gives hard questions on the exams
4.0,W,really wen into this class thinking it was going to be nightmare she is stern and can be intimidating at times but she is fair tests are right from lecture and textbook study and there would be no reason you will fail there were multiple curves given to offset the questions that many students got wrong overall great lecturer and fair teacher
1.0,M,the worst proffessor ever i dont understand how still a teacher in miami dade college he makes you buy the book and we never use it he doesnt tell you your grade until the last day of the semester stay away
5.0,W,in a history of math classes taken ive never actually received of any of my test she even gave us candy do the extra credit trust me it helps
5.0,W,best math professor ever had in my life truly a gem nicest person ever she actually cares about her students gives extra credit
3.0,W,definitely not my favorite prof learned on mathlab then in class because im not too good at math and her teaching style good to me if your already good youll do well but if not make sure you teach and prepare yourself and study in groups lots of homework online before test tests and she gives lots of extra credit study
4.0,M,great professor i would for sure take him again i really enjoyed coming to class al l you have to do is come to class everyday on time and complete the assignments and you will pass he is really fair and is willing to work with you to help you pass but you must do your part
3.0,M,dropped the class after three classes he was excepting everyone to be an english major im willing to work for my a but man the time
1.0,M,prof allen is a nice professor however he expects everyone to be a writer i didnt like the class at all and he used to make jokes all the time that were not funny if you are good at writing take him if not look for someone else its no time an easy a
5.0,M,preston allen was one of the most weirdest but funniest professors i ever had he would make a few face expressions that would make a few students laugh he is straight forward with the work during the semester and how he want things done have around essays with feedback provided after each one overall great professor and learn
1.0,M,i did not like him at all tough grader
5.0,M,he is a professor that actually makes you think in a good way his lectures are the ones that when you finish them you want to tell your friends what was discussed strongly recommended
5.0,M,very interesting and fun class i learned so much from him you will have to write a lot of research papers but you will gain so much knowledge from each of them he is very fair with grading i would take his class again
5.0,M,professor allen is an amazing individual i would definitly take his class again he made it fun to learn about all the boring things of english be sure to purchase one of the books he wrote they are awesome
5.0,W,i truly recommend taking this class i have never learned so much her classes are very difficult but definitely manageable her lectures are interesting and funny and she is also very understanding
5.0,W,my class was once a week and hours stats class she did not give us any homework since the class was so long i think sh explained things well but statistics is just difficult for me as it is for most people she let us use a notecard on one of the tests she really was great though and i recommend her sometimes she would let us out early
4.0,W,i completely disagree with most of the comments about professor johnson the reason all of you think badly about her classes is simply because math is hard i was never good at math but i got an a in her class simply because i payed attention if you do good in her class simply because you did not pay attention
5.0,M,professor labarge is simply the best if you want to enjoy learning take him
1.0,M,a nice and funny guy but he is so unprepared and know how to use sakai or a computer for that matter never responds to student emails never know when the exams or quizzes are going to be he lectures about personal life of time makes an easy a course hard to pass take
1.0,M,nice guy but awful prof never hands things back and he is the most unorganized prof you will ever have does not have actual notes text book is very unclear you know what you have in the class until final grades are in unless you have a lot of time to devote to this class do not take it it is not an easy a
4.0,W,amazing i took an express week course for that i was nervous about since math one of my strong suites but prof yarmish goes slow and makes everything crystal clear very patient and she truly wants all her students not just to pass but to understand the material for future math courses you may need to take
1.0,W,professor yarmish is tough she has a cold attitude and care about her students very cut and dry and take any effort into consideration downgrades your grade for the smallest thing
3.0,W,these comments accurately describe the class she does scream at the top of her lungs often which is annoying considering my class starts at am she goes off topic way to often talking about things that have no relevance to the class today we were supposed to review for the test but we ran out of time and able to
4.0,M,olay is a professor that makes you work for the grade you want there are presentations and the last one is a group presentation he grades outlines hard as long as you come to class pass textbook is only used for exam and final
5.0,W,best and most helpful professor had at millersville would not recommend skipping any lectures but she is very useful at office hours and responds to emails quickly i think the tests are fair and she prepares you for them in lectures plus homeworks are very easy and are good grade boosters
5.0,W,amazing professor she always had extra study sessions before exams and even before our final the homework was pretty easy all online and you could do it until you had on it
5.0,M,by far one of my favorite professors he can be a little strict with guidelines and rules but he is always willing to help great at keeping the class attention and teaches well you can see that he loves what he does but he also takes it seriously
5.0,M,professor martin really enjoys the subject of stress management the techniques he taught in class really work and can help they helped me a lot during finals week do the extra credit and online homework nd study and get an easy a
5.0,M,he is the best proffessor
1.0,M,this is the only class that was difficult for me to get through he teaches well but he has very strict rules and regulations he also can be very rude and mean anger like he is not understanding if you have a crisis funeral children etc he does not care no homework and test based course only hard to bring your grade up
2.0,M,if you will take his class it will be your nightmare semester course is very good to study but he studies like we have done and know all things lectures are sleepy homework is very tough as well exams take his class otherwise ready to ruin your semester and grades
3.0,M,peter peter peter good class but thats about it very straight forward and if you going to do the work bother with the class he expects you to know everything and if you its your own fault cool until you do something wrong then you get slammed for it and spoken down to like your an idiot
5.0,M,i took peter conti for both and this is a hybrid class you only meet in class about times for the whole semester he is a tough grader and expects a lot from his students he takes no excuses and if you do your work expect to pass but he is a great professor overall i really did learn a lot from him
1.0,M,this class was the main stress of the semester i hated it he thinks because he knows the subject everyone else does he makes you feel so stupid he give good instructions i worked my ass off and stressed more than i should have honestly take another professor spare yourself the trouble
2.0,M,do yourself a favor and take a different professor he is anything but encouraging and a tough grader make sure you know mla perfectly and be able to follow his terrible directions perfectly i was so stressed the whole semester i had him avoid
5.0,M,great professor be prepared to do the work but the work is easy if you apply yourself deadlines matter but he gives enough time to complete it assignments are based on current events so it easily keeps interest
5.0,M,i took him for a hybrid class and at first i honestly thought that i was going to regret it because he seemed tough after the first few assignments and in class lectures i was really liking the class and him as a professor he is a super cool guy he loves to focus on music and artists that he likes the topic papers are different and interesting
2.0,M,he lives all the way in california and travels to ny to teach he is a cool guy but not the best professor i took his hybrid class because i had no other choice and instantly regret it hard to keep up with his scattered online notifications he does not give any feedback yet singles students out in the classroom show up to class
1.0,M,do not take this class every single review on here is completely accurate if you do not want this class to be your life do not take he is rude condescending and you do not learn in his class his lectures do not pertain to the content he assigns excess reading that is never covered he also has very basic if that communication skills
3.0,M,lectures well but has a tendency to go off on tangents and can come off condescending at times he takes forever to grade assignments and grades as if a professional his instructions are fairly clear but the course is rigorous and if you have time to sit down and plan essays out be lucky to get out with a b
1.0,M,he constantly goes off on tangents that connect with the lesson if you miss one class might as well not show up for the rest of the semester
2.0,M,grades papers like you are a professional all of my papers i never got better than a c grade on he rambles on things that do not have anything to do with the work i would not take him again
1.0,M,if i had known how difficult potter was beforehand i have taken his class he took forever to reply to emails and when he did he was rude and short with me he took forever to grade papers so you basically know where you stand in the class all semester he graded very harshly on papers and makes you feel stupid
1.0,M,this guy give any feedback related to the writing process although i had my paper proofread by writing labs he nailed me because he like my mla format and what i had to say the mla was checked by professionals and my views are simply that my views gives incompletes if you label exactly how he said regardless writing
3.0,M,online classes have always been tricky and intro to lit is no exception i accidentally sighed up for the week class and with other classes--it was brutal i flunk but the workload was a lot he give encouraging comments least none that i ever got so it can sometimes feel like your lost and unsure how to improve your work
1.0,M,professor potter was impersonal was weeks months late in grading assignments and was extremely disorganized if not for what i knew from high school i would not have passed this class over half of the students dropped out i learned how to guess my way through unclear assignments and how to use his last-minute feedback in my prepared essays
5.0,M,just okay at literature but this class really helped me the prof offered lots of comments on my work and plenty of resources his lectures were smart and funny
5.0,M,i wanted to become a better writer this was the class to take mr potter did not waste my time and his process works
3.0,M,the online class was very disorganized which made the class very hard i had to email him a lot with questions and clarifications because of this usually pretty good about answering emails and is very willing to help you understand and do well class is based around reading lectures exams paper actually do the work and be fine
1.0,M,the second rating below me is probably dr sumner rating himself this professor will not answer emails he lags behind in all of his responsibilities as the department chair i suggest he be demoted back to assistant professor and let one of the more qualified professors take his spot
2.0,M,this professor does not care to help when you reach out to them for help the tests are timed and are very difficult i completed all my course work and i feel like i deserved a d he is super tough grader when you need help or you have question about the assignment he does not answer in a good time frame i still have not received a response
2.0,M,dr richardson is one of the worst lab teachers you can imagine he is extremely unclear with what he wants for lab reports texts and quizzes i emailed him several times and never got responses highly recommend to avoid him at all costs
4.5,M,the lectures are sleep-inducing unless u participate he gives lots of credit if u do study sheets for quizzes so u know what expect tests are do-able if u read the material page paper at the end so sick of doing philau papers
5.0,M,thinks too much knows too much but all in all hes a great person to work with though sometimes it looks like its painful for him to the sweat is a shame

3.5,W,i had race in america and although we differed on our views she was clear on her views and on her expectations for the class
1.0,W,very teacher would normally be an easy class she refuses to help you with any concerns and copies quizzes from an online database that go along with the book leading to a high percentage of low scores
4.0,W,she definitely grows on you if you stick with the class challenging but very worth it

1.5,W,the drop information says it all as an intro class this is nearly impossible because she help you even if you ask the books that we buy are hers and they are error filled and no as helpful as on-line sites although she will let you drop
2.0,M,his way or the highway get out while you still can
1.0,W,she is an inexperienced professor who basically reads an outline and poses questions to the class throughout class the worst part is that if most of the class failed a quiz or every class she was totally callous indifferent avoid her

5.0,M,although he is always late for class overall a pretty good prof he has a strange sense of humor but tries to make class interesting his tests can be somewhat tricky so i recommend reading the book thoroughly if you want to do good on his exams
1.5,M,for someone who is all about being professional and being on time he sure is late every day his class is rather pointless and very boring he needs to teach at a college level not kindergarden

4.0,W,the only thing that i would change about the class is format of the tests she uses too many mc questions that are worth too much of the grade it would be easier to study if there were a matching or short answer section partial credit

3.5,W,class was interesting sometimes we went off topic but we usually went back on tests and they are not soo easy i didnt do so well but that may be partially my fault her tests are vert hard and wordy she doesnt give extra credit if you need it good luck
1.0,W,one of the worst professors in terms of relaying course content all she does is talk about her family friends and celebrities she met she is totally disorganised and always strays from the topic to actually learn something from this class i would suggest that you not take her
3.0,M,very easy going and helpful great teacher i learned so much from him
4.5,M,certainly not afraid to say on his mind he speaks perfectly clearly i got an a in the class and felt so good because of it apparently not an easy class the subject material is easy but you absolutely must be prepared for the tests as they are very thorough i say they are too hard though they are fair
1.5,M,insulting and condescending still got a b in his class
4.0,M,even though he writes fast but he speaks loud and very clear in class he is a good professor
1.5,M,if you are a legitimate student this will be cake so easy but i hated myself for taking it he is biased and the worst thing was that the types even see through his garbage enough to be outraged unless you need a gpa boost badly take this class it was the worst one taken since middle school
3.5,M,really easy class and the topics are interesting but he presents it in a way that really hold your interest really need to go to class to do well
4.5,M,very nice at times but funny in a corny way he lets you revise all your papers so you basically get which will boost your grade he is a very good teacher
5.0,M,really funny makes you want to go to class sort of a tough grader but he lets you revise all of your papers so you have second chances and he will be around to help you
4.0,M,ryan stark so many words for ryan stark take the class ignore your first impression of him i think a swell guy although seen him like four times between and am wearing flannel super funny surprisingly a difficult grader but are revisions
5.0,M,this teacher is smart and fun if a bit wacky keep you guessing which will keep you interested something good for a subject that can be a bit dull he encourages discussion and seems to actually care what his students have to say though get off track a lot there will be a point somewhere not just rambling about himself
3.0,W,teacher was so focused on getting assignments completed that she ignored the needs of the students creating a negative learning environment she often would not allow breaks would teach during lunch and assigned more homework then possible leaving students tired and stressed take another teacher if possible
4.0,W,she isnt that bad of a teacher you def have to read the book because she doesnt go over everything in class the tests r ok just have to study hard easy grader on papers and tends to scream bark and kick when she does demonstrations a lil wierd
2.5,M,his lectures are permanent tangents
3.0,M,he is a difficult teacher grades tough alot of writing in this class like the class not crazy about teaching style
5.0,M,one of the greatest teachers i have ever had tarkow is able to take comments at the beginning of class and weave his lecture around those points the discussion is always deep but never tangential he has a wonderful classroom presence a picky grader but he gives you all the tools in class you could ever need to do well
1.5,M,i really do wish there was some way to pass his class i worked so incredibly hard and studied like crazy and still got a c at least not mean but if you take him sit in the front row because hard to hear
1.5,W,oh my worst class i have ever taken she talks all class about nothing we received so many handouts which was such a waste of social process oviously do not represent her so told attitudes avoid her at all costs
4.5,M,he is a good professor he really explains the material being covered and also he assigns homework which is really helpful when taking the tests also he helps you at the end of the semester if you need it
5.0,W,great professor fun activities that helped me to learn the material she makes the class can also be no nonsense when students try to cheat on exams or hand in other work earned my respect
1.0,M,he sucks if you have any class with him drop out fast
4.5,M,class is pretty interesting but like others have said he wants to cover way too much i learned a lot but that was because i worked hard in the class one of the hardests classes for a bio major but also one of the most interesting
4.0,W,she is really good if you show your effort she will pay for you
4.0,W,her tests are easy yet she is not an easy marker i agree that she is picky she is definitely gonna fail you if you miss her class for more than times
5.0,W,a greaaaaaaaaaaaat teacher eventhough i failed in her course but her class was really easy i failed in this course because i missed alot of quizes and assignment however she is a good teacher strongly recommend
3.0,M,taken irv for and teaches you more than anyone needs to know he laughs at his own jokes and is a little awkward learned a lot from both classes and received a in both
4.5,M,irv is a cool guy if you are a cs major or are just into computers be prepared for difficult tests but he grades on a curve you will without a doubt learn a lot in this class
3.5,M,super funny and that makes the class very clear when he talks math but sometimes hard to understand him when speaking plain english i hate boring math teachers and not even close to being boring
4.5,M,great is pretty easy and if your having trouble following the class he is more than willing to assist you even during you wont have any regrets taking his class and his accent is not a hindurance in your studies
4.5,M,i had a d in the same subject that i took in previous quarter this proffessor might seem funny but his way of teaching is extreemly makes sure that u get what he is trying to teach u very good teacher
3.5,M,mr quereshi is awesome he was easy i never understood what he was saying but also from an area in which people only speak english he really tries to make you understand he is pretty funny and has a great personality he never responds to emails though if you can take him
1.0,M,he understand english that well he only has one hour a week office hours to help all of his students he reply in e-mails and he does not grade fairly do not take this teacher especially if not strong in math skills
1.0,W,lecture moves like a slug teaching style is mundane lecture seems like a seminar she is kind of rude snobbyish stays on the same point for long periods of time she asks too much of the class in terms of questions you can tell what going to say before she says it
4.5,M,i see some of the older ratings say too quick and too many notes i took operations mngmt with him and i dont remember writing down more than lines in any given class he has office hours two times a weeks which is great and he knows the field inside out which is great if interested in it further only good things to say
5.0,M,mr karakul really knows how to teach he does not care about the stuff that the students do not need fair in grading everything was prescheduled quizzes assignments exams examviewings i really enjoyed this course just study before the exams enough overall very good
2.0,W,she is very knowledgable and tries to communicate but something gets lost
1.5,W,unable to follow a keep a question in mind while answering uses panels completely ineffective she asks nonsensical questions what is a winning con arg circa most reading is not useful and reiterates the same point over and over she listen to student responses in class tries to pick fights run
5.0,W,excellent professor passionate about her subject
4.5,W,she is really helpful if you ask for it very interested in what you write about and is great when it comes to editing a rough draft so you can improve she has helped me to improve my writing skills so much she expects a lot out of her student so dont slack off but she doesnt expect something of you unless she believes it can be done
3.5,W,greta can been intimidating from the start but she is an incredibly knowledgeable instructor who really does want her students to engage and interact with the material if you get past the intimidation you can learn a lot from her
1.5,W,surprised she is still teaching evidently she improved in the last years i took a mexican-american studies class from her in the i was very interested in the subject but i have to say she was the worst professor i have ever had in my entire academic career what a miserable arrogant condescending person
1.0,W,i called this my assumed history class because of the number of times she said i think this is what probably happened even though not what the book says also she had us outlining the chapters and then lecturing on the same material it really was overkill for a topic as basic as us history
2.5,W,she is the worst teacher ever shes old a senile and not very helpful shes a photographer of architecture not an architect therefore she doesnt know much about actual architecture
4.0,W,morna knows what she is talking about and has alot of knowledge in the design industry she may not be as forceful as other teachers but she still helps out if you ever need it and will work with you outside of class which alot of other teachers do i would recomend her for design
1.0,W,sarcastic on the verge of being mean a little too cocky for my concentrate on the lesson without worrying what she was going to say next
4.0,M,super relaxed about deadlines and not a control freak like most professors he reminds me of my dad
1.0,M,not a good teacher he definitely tried though
1.0,W,there are a total of grades she grades easy because she care the tests are true or false if you want an easy a take this class if not you learn anything of importance in this class
3.0,W,she is very fun teacher can be a little tough but nothing we deal with speaches are not too hard good advice choose the topicks you care about otherwise she gets upset i would recommend to take her class she also lets you out of the classroom earlier
1.0,M,dont take him
3.5,W,very interesting class nobody really participated in class except for a select few she is disorganized do not expect your grades back a week after the due date maybe a month later very easy midterm and assignments easy a
2.0,W,if you need organization in a class she will not be the teacher for you she is very disorganized and just rambles on about the material she does not give back assignments on time either i personaly learned nothing in this class
5.0,M,narrow students stand his defense of family amid a torrent of moral relativism the mainstream sheep protecting the harder ground arrogant rather delightfully vulnerable
1.0,M,would contemplate slitting my wrists during his class just for entertainment to keep me boring
1.0,W,had her for online she will not reply to your get used to that her tests come from three different sources so prepare to study
3.0,W,she is a very interesting teacher a little on the nutty side buy very inteligent she has a habit of geting off subject but she grades and test fairly expect alot of reading and homework time to get an a in her class though
3.5,W,i made an a in the class but i had some med term experience before i took this class she is a good teacher she give practice tests which are similar to the mid-term and final but there is alot of memorization so if you do not like to study take this course
2.0,W,insanely hard professor i tried to meet with her about certain aspects of my grade and she seemed extremely hard to get in contact with as well as unresponsive to emails and inquiries i would not recommend her if you care about your grades at all
3.0,W,a very hard professor and she expects a lot out of you the amount of reading is rather obnoxious and she expects that reach a whole new level of learning just from being in her class sometimes funny and she seems nice but i think she expects far too much for a survey class
5.0,W,i belive she dosnt have a chili peper she deserves i have never liked history it was always my struggle class in hs but she makes history fun interesting enjoyable and easy i wish she taught every subject you have to take her i got an a and learned so much and it was my favorite class

3.0,M,class was okay i guess if you like a class with stated guidelines do not take i was often unclear about what he expected from me on the work because he never stated what he wanted exactly but if you do bad on the work he does let you do it over again test are easy if you study lots of stories about his son he is over all a nice man
5.0,M,he is extremely in to teaching and has a very good way of getting points across however you really need to study for his tests not necessarily the multiple choice but the essays he is very down to earth and funny but expect an a unless you put forth some effort get ready to hear funny stories mostly about his son great guy
4.5,M,this class was real easy the guys knows what he is talking about
3.0,W,she is extremely easy she cancelled class at least times in one semester because she had other obligations all quizzes are online even have to buy the book because the labs are online

4.0,M,he is a great teacher cool thing was is he has actually been out in the feild before teaching you will learn a lot if you come with the right attitude i am not interested in astronomy but he is so it makes it more interesting take him if you fall asleep easy i like his class but go to class and he like people who ask questions
5.0,M,he is very nice and helpful always available for office hours and answers emails very quickly i really enjoyed the topic and he made the class fun he picks good and the papers that hard there are about papers total and all about pages the final paper is totally your choice on topic
1.0,M,dr wiseman is very strict and has no patience for students that have families he does not make try and meet the needs of a student that is going through a hard time and also as well he does not narrow down what to study before an exam
4.5,M,expectations are too high but he marks easy and is fair
4.0,M,he has high expectations for his students but this only helps you to learn how to do it the right way once you get through his first years class his other classes are a breeze he just likes to weed out the dumb people
5.0,W,sue is probably the best professor had probably gained more from her classes than from any other her enthusiasm about teaching was present in every single class i imagine people not liking her unless they want to do the work and learn i only wish all of my professors cared as much as she did
4.5,M,great lecturer if you can get past and provides good in-depth examples and great summaries you can study for tests from them and is always available to help he expects you to read the material prior to class and loves relevant questions read come to lectures daily and get an easy a
1.0,M,i counted the number of and and there were in minutes i found i was so distracted by his speech impediment that i focus on the words in between the a stubborn old man who grades unfairly his tests are long and hard the reading was difficult to keep up with as well this class was a gpa killer
4.0,M,knows his stuff and expects you too as well he called out some kid in class because the kid made a dumb comment i like that lots of reading tests are hard going to class is essential use pencils
2.5,M,long lecture feels even longer because of his lecturing style difficult to understand his lecture but plentiful class notes make up for it difficult to prepare for the examines since there is no study guide whatsoever too much reading and even the reading materials are boring he even changed the exam format a week before the final
3.0,M,when i took him last semester he was cool this semester is differnt he isnt very helpful anymore bcuz people took advantage of him im a strait a student and i failed the midterm bcuz he wont help on the chapters any more which sucks he does give extra credit though beware he changes dont know what he will be like next semester
3.5,M,he does babble on in class about useless kids and hes an awesome guy you have to maintain a all assignments and not miss more than the amount of absences and you dont have to take the was a huge stess relief at exam just in case u do have to take the exam refer to your quiz book and b
4.5,W,therese is a hard professor who expects a lot from her students but is fair and supportive her lectures are well organized engaging and intelligent a brillant woman who knows what teaching she gives a lot of feed back on papers with helpful comments i urge anyone to take a class from therese before they graduate
2.5,W,shes nice some of the time other times shes can be really mean and nasty wont answer questions degrades you if shes in a bad mood and asks if you know how to read id advise not to ask her questions during lab but do everything possible to find the answer yourself not bad of a grader she knows what she is talking about
4.5,W,this was one of my favorite classes that i have taken she is a great lady and the class not only learn from her and the book but from eachother and life experiences i loved how she approached the material i would definately take it and whoever claims the workload is high its a daily concept map that you get to use on the test
2.0,M,class has both lecture and discussion hear him in lecutre which was often not relevant he often went way over on time not a class-skipper but did several times with this one though discussion was mandatory his paper assignment was impossible and he was little help
5.0,M,he is a great prof very helpful and dylan also keeps him going lectures are boring tests are ridiculous but not hard his classes are all the same also he reminds me of the sloth off of ice age
2.5,M,knows his stuff i think anybody can argue with that but i really enjoy his class lectures were fine but i really do believe the tests were very poorly written and failed to really capture how well a student knew the material take him again if at all possible
1.0,M,not a very good professor here are the high points lazy often used old outdated powerpoints tests frustrating at best i studied hours for one made a b studied three hours for another and made an a his exams do not test the concepts taught in lecture and the book one of the worst professors i have had science or otherwise
5.0,M,a great biology teacher his notes are helpful if you actually study them this is college not highschool so supposed to put in effort to get a good grade i only went over his notes read the chapters and did the online quizzes and made a great grade in the class if you like studying or reading i suggest you switch majors
4.5,W,she reminds me of chris rock her crude humor will keep you on the edge of your seat wondering what she will say next this class is everything you wanted your tenth grade health class to be like very easy b if you show up you might not like her if you are easily offended or are uber sensative
4.0,M,gallaher is my favorite teacher i had my first year at northwest he makes class fun and entertaining with his many jokes
3.5,M,i found his lectures clear although i found that i could teach the material to myself better this professor took me before the senate on plagiarism charges which i was innocent of and he ignored me as a student after the allegation which was extremely stubborn of him he has a rep for doing watch out i still thought he was a good prof thou
4.5,M,so glad i got prof stewart for my short story class he was a fun and interesting teacher with a well-structured class and fantastic lectures not shy about his own opinions but he encourages opposition from his students as well definitely looking up his other classes to take in future
3.5,M,very and overal i felt like i learned very little from the class he would let students rant on about how each story related to their life-group therapy-esque gag i only marginally disliked him until i had medical problems and he accused me of lying to him not being a serious like nice guy but an assh
4.0,M,shortstory-i understand how people think pompus and arrogant but that made me like him even more i found him funny rather than rude made the class more like discussion period rather than just a regular lecture this was one of my fav classes i found him helpful he gave me good direction for my paper exam was more difficult than i expecte
4.5,M,somewhat boring but has his random funny times which you dont expect and hes super nice to talk to you learn a lot in this class and the are really easy good class overall

4.0,M,really really awesome so so smart and he presents a very interesting view of the new testament a lot of work but really worth it i learned so much and he teaching method including interesting uses of the word is very engaging
2.5,W,hard class quizes once a week she is super smart when it comes to math but always know how to teach it well recommend if you did not have calc before
4.0,W,great professor tough material you will get from her class what you put into it as long as you show her effort she will do her best to help you
3.0,W,nice person but perhaps on a different intellectual level at times lectures can be hard to understand she will always help you if you ask and not too hard on due dates can grade hard at times
5.0,W,she is one of the best profs at sju
4.0,M,zeman is the man take him tests make up percent of your grade and the questions on the test are directly off the quizzes plus he gives you the essays ahead of time the bad quiz a wk is a major pain only of avg tho paper is nearly impossible to write but he grades it easily lowest grade was a youll prob get a b
5.0,M,you never have to read he pretty much tells reads the chapter for you in class great teacher and very helpful take him
5.0,W,she is vert good at what she does and extremely helpful
3.5,M,he only seems like a very scary man as long as you attend lectures and make notes in your book his classes are a breeze a great prof once you get through his first year class
2.0,M,interesting class yet so hard to learn because of the teaching methods probably the worst prof ever had although he may think his models are simplifications of reality they are just plain confusing can be quite ignorant as well i would suggest to avoid this class at all costs if mcginn is still the prof
5.0,W,dr gubacs is my hero and not even kidding i loved her class badminton fencing and tennis and i loved her as a professor she is extremely professional courteous fun i loved her drive and competitiveness and really taught us how to teach i would highly recommend dr gubacs as a professor taking her again in the fall

3.5,W,dr deguchi is really sweet and an amazing musician an okay professor her grading is fair and her accent is amusing but the textbook will be your greatest friend she bases her teaching solely on the book at times
3.0,W,my roommates said the way she teaches it now is a lot harder than before everyone did poorly on the case study we had to do i had a group that did not understand the material completely which help by the time she explained the material in full for teh section we had to hand it in people that went for help still recieved bad grades
5.0,W,great professor knows her stuff has open office hours very nice brings in candy and stuff definitely recommended

4.0,W,wang laoshi hugged me one day suoyi wo hen is very understanding and helps you through chinese if having trouble she means well everyone should go to chinese table
3.0,M,allen knows his stuff inside and out however well aware of this and as such values his own opinion that aside the class is a breeze and only consists of daily journals participation and an exam if you have ever watched a movie in your life you could probably do well in this class
5.0,M,ya guys are crazy i just graduated from john jay thinking that i was going to fail this class to my surprise it was not that bad he is by far the best professsor i ever had at john jay he makes you work and read alot this is what will be expected of you in grad school and the real world he teaches straight foward and explains student

1.0,M,he thinks he is a dictator and is going to take over the world he looks down upon his students like they are nothing take with him take it with prof sung he is much better
1.0,M,this was by far the worse course i had ever taken not only is this professor rude disrespectful and confusing but he has the audacity to insult people i knew he was going to be a problem when i saw that he and panzarella wrote the book and by the way the book sucks also do not take him
5.0,M,dr janz is amazing and his wife is a very lucky woman his class is extremely interesting and a sharp dresser
4.5,M,i had professor janz for intro to religion super nice the class was easy and i actually learned the material his tests are relatively easy although he tends to focus on dates let that scare you-the only way to get less than a b in any class he teaches is by not coming or taking notes

5.0,M,mr tyson is an inspiration if you plan to use any college degree for any area you should take his biology course while his daily tests are annoying if you keep up flunking by the week but if you read the daily requirement you will have no problem with the simple tests it prepares anyone how to study for a college cours
5.0,M,i agree with the last person milner is awesome he makes the class enjoyable and i got a lot out of discussion he teaches you exactly what you need to know to be an effective teacher but at the same time makes you learn it on your own if you hope to be a great teacher take milner you will enjoy it
4.0,M,this class does take a lot of time and work but i believe it was all worth it in the end dr nelson is a very smart man and normally pretty nice he does have his days though the semester project takes a lot of time and you should start it as early as possible
1.0,M,a senior and this was the worst class ever taken i chose this professor because he had good ratings here but they been updated in a couple years because something must have happened to turn this guy into a total prick he is mean unhelpful and just downright rude to students no not take this professor

5.0,W,the nicest and most helpful teacher that i have ever had there is a lot of work to do but she explains it so well it really is not that bad you will have to do the same amount of work in this class whether you take her or not but in my opinion you could not get a more helpful professor
5.0,W,the absolute best prof ever had if i could have taken her for all my educ classes i might not have swithched majors go to class and pay attention which isnt hard because she makes it interesting
1.5,W,very boring teacher i was interested in psychology a lot before i took this class but because she bored me to death in class i could care less about child development now you do not need to go to class just print out the slides she is really disorganized with her notes and takes forever to post the grades
4.5,M,he is an okay teacher yes he knows the law but is hard of hearing and boring

1.5,M,i know he seems intimidating easy the key to this class is to do the work people come to class prepare ie do the readings and then expect him to teach all the basics simple do the work before class challenge yourself by extra problems ask the tutor if you have questions and do fine
2.5,M,my stomach used to turn every day when i went into his class good luck

5.0,M,great chef and teacher just wished they would let him teach during the day
4.5,M,mr pouncy is a great english teacher but you will not get an easy grade in his class you have to work hard and he does challenge his students only because he wants to prepare them for university always informed us that we are the only one that can truly increase our knowlegde and become effective at being a good am am
4.0,M,sometimes smart people are hard to approach he knows what hes talking about just is very unique in his delivery

5.0,W,rebecca laidlaw is awesome she as tough as these comments say she is she makes everyone feel comfortable with speaking easily in fornt of the class by having everyone get to know one another the class was acually fun
4.0,M,chemistry with any professor is hard the subject is hard in general dr berg has years of experience and he really makes his lectures in a way where its understandable and applicable to exams his exams are difficult but not tricky pay attention and take notes make sure you make common student errors that he points out and practice
1.5,M,i would rather take a teacher that actually uses the textbook believe it or not the material he lectures does not even come from the book very easy to get lost
3.0,M,i learned absolutely nothing in this class that i figure out on my own with common sense the class was a waste of time but it made for an easy a and grossman although not helpful at all is really nice get on his good side and let you get away with anything his project is extreamly easy and his tests are a breeze
3.0,M,his powerpoints summarize in the book problem is his voice is very low and i get bored easily cool cause you can just surf the web but you have to read the book to keep up rely on his lectures they go all over simulations and a case project mandatory for this class and section any way midterm and final
1.0,W,this is one of the worst classes i took at the u of a the teacher is really biased in teaching she talks a lot about her opinion not anything interesting or useful try to get a better trad you need to goto class take notes everyday writting pages and test and a final test are easy questions but the other are hard
2.0,M,he is very disrespectful towards students and will not answer questions also will reprimand students for taking bathroom breaks tests were easy but the material was monotonous one of the few classes where i did not learn anything new
3.0,M,class was ridiculously easy an easy a if you care enough to do the work and pay some attention dr sirkin seems gruff but is actually a very nice guy he just expects students to act like adults and take their work seriously makes sense to me if you mature enough to be responsible you probably like his class though
3.5,W,this class was quite boring but easy if you use the lecture outlines on webct golden tends to ramble and get wordy in test questions but she is always willing to answer questions in class
4.0,W,attendance is mandatory even in a person lecture hall there are course assistants in every row to make sure there class is relatively boring with her but worth it for the attendance it can really bring your grade up bring lecture notes to class and discussion it really makes everything much easier

2.0,W,mrs estes was not a good teacher she was hard to understand and would go on about things that important then she skims over the things that are very difficult not very helpful when struggling with something she teaches the class as though everyone already knows the material she seem to understand that everyone is
3.5,W,class hard to sit through very boring she answers her own questions and just goes through the problems in the book
3.0,W,i do not like her i feel that she care about your grade and she will not help you unless you schedule for help on her time i would not recommend this teacher
3.5,M,his online class was hard
5.0,M,is an excellent instructor that will do anything that he can to help i say that is class is easy but if you make a good effort you can make an a in his course if you take this course make sure that you complete all homework assignments and review test they are important because they are similar to the test
4.0,W,online class work was consistent but not over bearing i am taking her now for college algebra good teacher and most of the times understanding about late work and having it extended to complete it
5.0,W,talk about a professor that cares she will do whatever it takes to explain it to you i would for sure take her if you feel you need a kind rather meek teacher that can really teach super nice
2.5,W,i would never take her again the homework was on the computer and the test were on paper and if the clas doesnt understand something and you ask a question she says she has office hours most people had stopped coming by the end of the semevery sit was packed at the start if your not good with math on the computer i wouldnt take her
1.0,W,she was unwilling to help she taught horrible but i will give her the credit of being a nice person

4.0,W,mrs lawson was a great teacher she uses the book website for all of the quizzes and tests people that read fast take her her online quizzes and tests are timed it seems only the slow readers complained about that she uses a lot of supplemental material in class which i thought was great i would recommend her to anyone
2.5,W,ok teacher notes in class do not pertain to test go to the website and read chapter summary and take chapter test a lot of questions come from there read book a lot make sure you take notes on the movie clips beacuse she uses those on the final overall she was an ok teacher

3.5,M,although he uses analogies that really make sense to describe everything he is still a very straighforward professor take notes on class lectures and study those for the quizes the tests are exactly like the practice tests
4.0,W,i had her as a teacher yet but she is my director for the fall play and she is fantastic
2.5,W,the good news wendy is smart and witty the bad news she knows it at first you laugh along with her and then you realize how condescending being she has no respect for risd and insults it all the time
2.5,W,she gives you a grade based on your effort craftsmanship is first then design and materials play some part too which is bad for you because the cost of materials link to the quality she buys some supplies so if frugal you can get away with spending she tries to help and talks a lot with demos but it ends up boring students
5.0,M,awesome teacher had him for a couple of classes really good teacher
1.0,M,horrible teacher he uses his personal opinion over the text information on tests buy the book you need it attendance isnt mandatory so bother going rude and has a very negative outlook on life the very first day of class he let us know that of us would be divorced just ruuude
4.5,M,a nice guy the class was very boring and made sure to keep us to the last second he does a review the class before each test just take notes that class and study them and do fine on the tests
4.0,M,class is pretty easy gives extra credit when he takes attendance lectures are decent
1.0,M,economics is a tough field for me and i really struggled in this class i met with him during office hours and he able to offer me any advice i spent on a tutor and i still do well i got a c which i consider bad for the amount of work i put into the class he also made a mistake and recorded my grade as an f and i had to go through tons of paperwork to get it changed avoid this teacher
5.0,M,caporale is a good teacher and he is very clear on what he wants from you he makes sure he explains things thoroughly and is very helpful his tests are hard if you a good studier take this class
1.5,M,really enthusiastic about economics but i found that what he taught really reflect what was on the midterms reading the book is all that really matters because when it came to the tests my notes were pretty much useless
4.5,M,tony is such a cute professor he sort of reminds me of a turtle but i want to diss him because really enthusiastic about economics i think econ is very interesting but his lectures go really fast and usually get out early i still like econ a lot but glad he was my professor he also gives extra credit assignments
3.0,M,oh brother i can see this guy being like tony montana at home he explains everything clearly but the tests are pretty difficult for someone who really get economics but i rarely paid attention in class use the textbook listen in class and take notes and i bet this class be too hard
5.0,M,he rocks bob really takes the stress out of learning math focused on not making things hard for you so that you can get to math as quickly as possible you get to keep the test questions so that if you fail he calls you with what you got wrong and you just bring your answers in i wish he taught everything
5.0,M,great teacher explained everything clearly and always wrote examples on the board never got below a on any of his tests
2.0,M,what i got was stories about grandchildren an old guy named levi and a bunch of other stories i could do without i had a declared male witch who talked throughout the class about anything from succesful spells to his druidic staff and the teacher let him talk as much as he wanted if you want a teacher as smart as the ones from high school
4.5,W,read the books and do fine the background reading really even necessary very personable friendly i liked her
3.5,W,she was nice wastes a lot of time in class though tests werent bad but you have to attend class because they are lecture based pretty easy grader
3.5,M,overall he is a nice professor but if you like note taking he is the person to take his tests are pretty hard because he is not a visual person it seems like he just expects you to know it
4.0,M,not a bad teacher at all if you study you will make a good grade on the test if you don miss any days in his class he will give you extra points on your final grade
3.5,M,he has all the personality of a carpet sample but his class is pretty cut and dry just print off the power point slides and study those if you do that you should be ok
3.5,M,schibig is a boring his class is not hard at all if you study the powerpoint notes you will pass the test i think that most students dont like him because they havent realized yet that this is college and not high school and that they need to grow up and do the work
5.0,M,dr schbig was awesome in the fact that he was incredibly easy made an a no problem he will put you to sleep while talking and has a dry old since of humor but its funny not a bad teacher for biology would recommend because incredibly easy
2.5,W,overall class was hard she teaches by powerpoint but some of the info on the test is from the book so read her test are extra thats the only thing that you get a grade for in the lecture part of class theres no homework or anything so you must do well on the test i wouldnt take her again
2.5,M,he is not one of my favorite teachers if you like to stare at power points the whole class then you will be fine he does give you the review but if you expect the test to be worded anything like the review then think again you better know the material inside and out you will definately earn your grade in this class
4.5,M,a great teacher and he makes a tough subject a little easier he gives you study guides and just wants you to grasp the main ideas he stress the tiny details he really knows all about anything even related to the subjects we discuss in class reccommend him to anyone who needed to take i or ii or micro
2.0,M,castiner cares a little too much about al this stuff most of the readings are not that exciting though a few are potentially useful he thinks all of the reading connect to each other somehow there is a typed hw assmt due every class hw is self graded but is still a hassle also get on his good side and you have smooth sailing
4.0,M,very thorough about the text and very entertaining to listen to but god help you if you miss turning in an assignment at the end of the semester i turned a few in after finals and it took the guy months to change my incomplete to a b and he only did so after i sicked my advisor on him
5.0,M,powers is a wonderful teacher the class is very difficult but he makes it easier i would def take him again if i need more chemistry
5.0,M,great professor he was my favorite chemistry teacher he is very clear and helpful i would def take him again if i needed to take organic as i had him also for general chemistry i got an a
5.0,M,parris powers is great he actually cares about his students and wants them to succeed he is always willing to help feel free to stop by his office it does wonders chemistry is hard no doubt but his method of teaching is very down to earth and easy to comprehend i was scared to death about taking chemistry and made an a in his class
4.5,M,mr neilin is a good teacher to take fundmentals of chem gets poeple involved in class and he gives lots of am a person that learns best by interacting reading the book and doing extra teacher is extreamly patient if you ask dumb questions and will help you after him if you are a thourough learning typ
4.5,W,she was my fist teacher in almost ten years it was a pleasure to have her introduce me into the world of college she is kind funny and very helpfull she is very understanding and willing to help in anyway as long as you do what she asks a fun class
2.5,M,easy class he really do much we did not use the book much and he went over whatever would be on tests grades easy on speeches as long as you act like you care and seem like you are halfway prepared he expresses his liberal political views in class which got on my nerves along with the inappropriate language

5.0,M,this guy is hilarious i just finished a semester with him i wish he taught the next course of math i have to take
5.0,M,i bet the previous post is from the girl who had already failed his class once and probably failed again he was without question the best math teacher i have ever had at any level the few phone calls he had were because of his level of responsibility with his full time job they were few and far between students took calls if needed also
2.0,M,you girls need better taste in men he was always taking calls from work which intrupted class made it hard to follow that cd you got he knew nothing about it there were in the library that were easier than he was i never showed you any short cuts for the work he was usually late for class up to a half an hour or so i was notimpressed
5.0,M,great teacher always makes class laugh and is gret to look at i wish i could take him for more classes

5.0,M,the todd is the man i am sure that if i had had him as a math teacher earlier in life i would be a rocket scientist by now
4.5,W,she is very helpful at times she is also very funny but she can also be dingy
3.0,W,she doesnt really teach on a beginners level for beginners french shes a nice lady but her thoughts are always scattered and confusing she repeats herself alot so we basically went over the same thing every day which got frustrating as she was assigning other things but was still explaining some of the first things we went over in class
4.5,W,seriously the best teacher i have ever had i would totally recommend taking her classes very helpful always willing to go the extra mile to make sure you understand everything very giving and wants everyone to do well love this lady
1.5,W,she was horribly rude and mean to everyone in the class i hated going to her class and often went home feeling like i wanted to cry her dealines are all over the place and she is less then helpful when asked a question that is when she doesnt put you down she told my whole class that we should drop out because we are going to make bad teachers
4.5,W,she is a fabulous teacher who is extremely nice i have two classes with her this semester and have not heard one mean thing from her mouth she is a very smart woman and i actually learned something in these classes
4.5,W,judy is very nice but frsutrating professor she didnt show up for many classes and was late for the ones she did make classes are a breeze and an absolute must for upper ge
3.5,W,class was easy and interesting her class consisted of showing up and enjoy the movie then go home and write a discussion paragraph within your group members online we only had to write couple papers during the entire semester just explain what you think of textbooks judy deserves some respect from her ppl were rude
1.5,W,i must say that i agree with all of the posts everyone has done i was a ta for her class and she not only sloughed everything off on us including the grading but she posted the grades we gave her late wreaking havoc on my financial aid really this is a dangerous situation for serious students or anyone wanting to learn
3.0,M,really difficult class but you will learn a lot memorizing all the equations is challenging but hopefully one day it pay off you work hard on the homework and minitest and he rewards you with a reasonably easy final if you study hard

4.0,M,very easy to understand he had some great in-class demonstrations too the only things that bugged me were the clickers for attendance make sure you get a friend to pick your up for class if going to skip
4.0,M,great teacher if you are interested in physics he is fun and makes sure to include the class in his teaching style might make it hard for a student who is not interested in physics taking ap physics makes this extremely easy
2.5,M,does not explain his lectures very well in class instead preferring to discuss concepts over doing actual example problems reading the textbook will be a must as you will probably not learn the material any other way his tests are also poorly worded and described would be better if he could actually explain his lecture material
5.0,W,carla is a straight up g she loves the material and loves seeing students dive in and excel with that being said a babe and a half

1.0,M,this is the worst teacher ever i know his whole life story because all he does is talk about himself and his family if your sitting through his class you might as well shoot your self in the foot because that would be more fun then his lectures

2.0,W,she never taught at all just put us in groups i totally disagree with the other comments saying she is easy her tests have nothing to do with what she has talked about in class would not ever take another class from her again but she seemed like a nice lady nun the less
4.5,W,wonderful professor she is very energetic and driven no homework other than reading takes attendance randomly gives study guides for her tests the only downside is the amount of reading required there are three books that must be read and read carefully for this class i suggest you make a friend in the class and study for the book exams

3.0,W,i thought dr carnes class was okay although i would not take her again the assignments appear easy at first but then surprised when you get a bad grade no feedback whatsoever given no comments on papers or grades on blackboard plays favorites and expects attendance every class absolutely no slack given
3.5,W,dr carnes cct class is hard that is all that can be said i am an a and b student and it was really tough to pull out a b by talking to her you would think she built the entire college with her bare hands she also bad mouths other professors in the college of business which i thought was terrible to do in the classroom do not take her
2.5,W,dr carnes was scary at first but i grew to like the class until the day she started kicking people out of the classroom i missed one day and she got extremely upset you definitely have to attend every single day and be prepared to take grammar quizzes everyday as well not a piece of cake class that it should be

1.5,W,often unfair and arbitrary in her grading
5.0,M,one of the best professors at fu not only is he a media god but friendly and eager to help individual students as well classes with him are actually fun esp the smaller classes and many of his students sign up for the courses he teaches just because teaching them makes you work but all the valuable has taught media execs

4.0,W,she is passionate and yes you will learn alot but the work load is overwhelming and will dominate all of your time
2.0,M,scripps have a clear class structure bounced from one idea to another in random order and sometimes came back to previous ideas with limited notes he was not well prepared for class students with some experience could have taught this class he relied on students knowledge to write the correct syntax and he referred us to google alot

3.0,M,he taught my senior seminar class and since never taught it before just kind of tossed things up in the air to see where land thought be tough being required to graduate but he kept all his same policies of attendance and due dates meaning none at all confusing off the wall made us cringe but glad i had him after all

2.0,W,got an a in this class thanks to others english prof nichols is a terrible teacher as during the whole semester she has not taught a thing about how to be more effective in argumentative writing the class is spent in useless discussions on her personal opinions about different subjects but give any clues on how to write bett

4.5,W,she was awsome her class was very hard but it was rewarding at the end of the semester she did a lot to help my public speaking i would reccomend her to any person if they want to better themselves in the area of public speaking
4.5,M,high workload however homework assigned directly connects to content if you have a really good case on a bad question he will listen like his class the exam questions comes from the textbook publisher and therefore is very picky you have to read because you get quizzed on reading before you are taught
3.0,M,hugh is hillarious but can be offensive if you are a softy he is an easy grader and has a healthy sense of self not modest
2.0,M,complete he picks a favorite in the class and hates everyone else would not recommend him unless he already loves you

1.0,W,what a waste of time i could have taken this online class without an instructor made an a but definitely had nothing to do with her teaching thank god i had old stats textbooks to rely on
3.0,M,easy class easy i actually learned a lot it introduces you to writing resumes and internal memos and such even keeping the book because i find it so helpful it will come in handy not a lot of easy good prof nice guy but he can go on and on talking about every detail of everything overall good
5.0,M,take this class there are quite a few writing assignments but you have a ton of time to do them if you do the work get a good grade inman is helpful when you have questions and he is definately not a hard grader i got an a with minimal effort also this class does teach important stuff for the future i learned quite a bit
4.0,M,he never gave us study guides and there is no textbook the tests are not really on what he teaches he tells us silly random stories that have no historical significance still fun facts but knowing them get you a good grade really funny and nice and if you miss a class he lets you skip on the exam
5.0,M,dr haynie is the best teacher i have ever had a big part of why i became a teacher he really brought the subjects to life and i strive to do that for my students
5.0,W,mrs haynie is probably one of my favorite professors in life she is still to this day a good friend and a mentor to me i love her and her classes were awesome
5.0,W,mrs haynie is one of my favorite teachers ever she really makes the subject interesting she cares about her students and very helpful with students who need extra help and teaching more proficient students new skills
1.5,W,this class is unbelievable boring the quizzes are hard and she no longer does tests quiz consists of questions with options for answers she expects you to know details about everything you read so unless you are a theo major stay clear oh and she grades essays based on how much she likes you for most of the class that means they failed
2.0,W,if you are a shy not take the of gender is a class where she wants you to she just picks people randomly and gets them to give out answers and class but not for shy students
1.0,W,horrible prof never knows what she will do each day very unorganized never hasmarks back until months later learned nothing from her
1.0,W,horrible prof never knows what she will do each day very unorganized never hasmarks back until months later learned nothing from her
1.0,W,mueller is a very oblivious professor she sometimes just goes on random rants that make no sense what so ever and have relation to the topic at hand during the start of the year i was looking forward to sociology but now this field is ruined for me because of the experience in her class
4.0,W,i love adele she is great i have had her for both research methods and senior seminar i was iffy at first she does tend to be back and forth about due dates and requirements but she is an easy marker always willing to sit down and have a chat very caring individual
4.0,W,i love adele i have had alot of boring profs that just stand in front and say exactly what was in the book like i cant read she talks about stuff that isnt on the test there arent any tests if you did the readings you can get an a on every single paper i have credits with her all shes very easy to talk to also
1.0,W,adele is not clear at all over the place you have no idea whether you will get an a or a d on a is if she doesnt loose it first not useless talking about the same points over and over again
2.5,W,okay im not going to be mean ill be fair she is scatterbrained but all sociology profs are hense the discipline must have an effect on the mind she is a little crazy but a great woman she shouldnt be condemned for personality i did not even know what was going on in her class but if i talked to her one on one she was fine
3.0,M,the most boring class ever he goes too fast when lecturing and he grades harshly he did curve our tests however which helped study a lot and try to keep up on reading pretty nice to me just be nice back and try
2.5,M,great guy really cares about his students stick to the biochem notes and do fine he curves so most people can pass with a c but if you cant get at least a b in his classes you need to become a business major attend lecture because he often cuts lots of material to study
1.5,M,horrible my entire class is lost he go over hw and only has responses to questions google people or this is an upper level class i expect you to know that he has a major ego issue seems to me like he got beat up a lot when he was younger his entire class is reading slide provided by the publisher drop drop now
4.5,M,dr c is a great guy he is totally approachable and helpful and you can easily your way through his classes
4.0,M,i love this teacher seriously i hate math and cannot understand his silly accent but the tests are a breeze show up the day before for the review and you will get an a no questions
5.0,M,sloan is not only the best professor in the world he is the best you value truth intellect and sincerity you will love and learn so muich from dr sloan he had done so much meaningful research and written so many books and articles if you have the privilege of being in his class you are lucky lucky lucky
5.0,W,great professor she will really help you out with essays if you go to her office hours
1.0,M,i like hoyt as a person and have a lot of respect for his intelligence however i think he might be the most boring philosophy teacher ever had he talks so slow and quiet that you just pay attention he could also make the most intense sex scandal seem abnoxiously bland and boring
4.0,M,entertaining lecturer enjoyed his class very much
4.5,M,class was enjoyable shorr gets a bad rap for getting upset when students talk raising their hands but his lectures are involved and straight off the top of his head so he like being taken off track be a respectable student who pays attention and do fine he speaks fast so be sure you can keep up w note taking
5.0,M,great professor he explains the subject matter very well
5.0,M,excellent professor really cares about students gaining alot of knowledge from his classes he was also very helpful
5.0,M,perhaps just the class that is hard because i know what everyone else is whining about duane is an absolute genius when it comes to problem-solving and abstract thinking and he looks at the subject matter in such an interesting fresh way he is a fair grader and not hard to do well if you study your book and hilarious
4.0,M,great class if you love weather great prof if you want to learn take if looking for an easy lab credit his class really should be level because its a serious science class weather is a lot of physics small number of majors set the high grades and the rest of us got screwed
1.0,M,this is the worst teacher ever had in my entire life he was useless do not take he told us not to worry about our grades however he screwed us all in the end and gave us lower grades than everyone at all costs for your own good
2.5,M,from what i gather classes before mine seemed to have taken advantage of duane or at least he felt like they did so then he made it too worth the stress esp if you reading humidity graphs and such is not going to be part of your life in the future stay away
2.5,M,cool guy but we were told he would scale grades at the end esp considering most of the class was getting averages on the tests but he didnt curve in the end interesting class but in the end it ended up hurting my gpa and just causing more stress in my life not worth it if simply searching for another lab science credit
2.0,M,dr rogers is a very nice person going to class helps out a lot because at the end of the semester if close to going up a grade he looks at attendance he also gives extra credit opportunities through quizes at the end of the semester
2.0,M,very nice teacher funny always a discussion class he brings viewpoints from theorists and get deep into their mind you really are there for the teacher the readings are sometimes difficult to too structured of a class always flips around subjects
4.5,M,this guy was probably the coolest professor ever he knows everything about everything completely a people person he seemed to know interesting facts about very uninteresting facts the best lectures ever that required you to really think outside of the box if you go to his office hours and ask questions help you lots
2.0,M,he truly thinks we have nothing else to do but read one of the assigned books page chapters and internet reading every night this man thinks our entire lives are history the only part of the class that isnt terrible is the take home midterm and final dont take this professor unless you are a history buff who has no life
4.5,M,really smart funny guy excellent teacher very knowledgeable expect to read a lot though our class because of a bookstore issue but traditionally he is very big on the reading
4.0,M,try as hard as you can he grades on effort if you do a lot he notices
3.0,M,craig is hard to understand at times he will go out of his way to help you then he will go off on you for the smallest things his temper gets in the way of his teaching i learned a lot from craig but the most important thing i learned was how not to treat people
4.5,M,he has high expectations and a strict attendance policy etc but he knows his subject well and is really helpful if you show interest if you follow the rules and actually do the work you get a lot out of the class i thought he was awesome and pretty funny sometimes too if you want to take an art class recommend him
3.0,M,its kinda hard to get an a in his class
4.0,W,a tough teacher but if you do the work you are fine take her if you get bored during lectures because hers tend to drag on
1.0,M,rothschild will only accept things his way he rarely updates grades on bb however i learned a alot and would take him again
1.5,W,very popular and never understood why i found her class tedious and her style annoying also quite arrogant
1.5,M,dr class is very boring do not take the material is quite interesting yet he conveys it in such a confusing way you might study hard but he grades in an odd manner have to memorize statistics out of book talks extremely low so you have to sit close lucky to get an a
1.0,M,i am currently in hell in this class not only does he look like a but he speaks very slowly and quietly and takes lots of pauses in his sentences hard to pay attention you probably be too motivated to go boring and the midterm is the first test of the semester
2.0,M,this teacher has no grading system you will not receive one single grade in his class and he randomly picks grades out for his students at the end of term if you like to gamble take his class
4.5,M,he was a good guy i liked his structured approach to the course and got the stuff done he was helpful and liked to help you if you really needed it which was greatly appreciated
4.5,M,dwayne is an awesome project instructor he takes care of the the project team in order to ensure that both the client and the needs are met without being intrusive he allows pms to take the lead in managing the project but is always available for support you should be so lucky to attend his class
4.0,M,his teaching style is the best seen in a while he is engaging and forces his students to think for themselves and actually learn the material
3.0,M,salloway is a great story teller and i did very well in his class if you do very well he will try and push you into the major he will be persistant too persistant anyways hopefully you have kvd as your lab instructor because she is hot and put out to me during the semester fun
3.0,W,salloway is a great story teller and i did very well in his class if you do very well he will try and push you into the major he will be persistant too persistant anyways hopefully you have kvd as your lab instructor because she is hot and put out to me during the semester fun
5.0,W,awesome prof she is very enthusiastic about the topic extremely knowledgeable and her class made me much more interested in the subject she makes a real effort to make assignments interesting and non-repetitive she is also super approachable and willing to help students out i highly recommend taking a seminar course from her
3.5,W,lectures are really clear but she is a horrible marker she will take marks off for anything spelling marks dont reflect how well you know the lecture material but how picky she decides to be when marking your she is very friendly in class but not so friendly one on one
2.5,W,absolutely terrible prof hardest marker ever and not fair at all watch out for definitions you need to put down exactly what she says in class to score marks and if you spell something wrong your whole definition will be wrong
3.5,M,ernie thinks very highly of be a bit rude at times and i guess you could say he over teaches some simple lab it take much to get it so i understand why he explained everything over and also encourages people to ask questions but tears them down and makes them look stupid when they do
4.5,M,he is very helpful and will help you with any question you have he wants you to understand and pass his class test too bad and he is a fair grader
1.5,M,often put students down for asking questions tests were somewhat dificult but if you study at all you shoul dbe ok if you can stand him its not that bad he wasnt very helpful inside or out of class vague and somewhat awful would never take again
4.5,M,charismatic guy loved going to class and he made all of us laugh a lot i do the reading ever not so great on the reading quizes not so great on the tests still got a b definitely recommend this guy especially if you do the reading but even if you just want to laugh for an hour and minutes twice a week
5.0,M,i have to agree with everyone else here todd is the best teacher i have ever had a really quirky and hilarious his higher-level courses are difficult but if you make a real attempt at understanding the content he is decently lenient with grading if you ever have a chance to take a class with him do it great advisor and mentor too
5.0,M,i have attended schools and todd is the best professor i have had at any of the schools i was not really interested in the class content at all but he made it interested anyways his lectures are hilarious they are better than sleeping in
4.0,M,i think i could videotape his lectures and make a very good tv show about him he is very interesting and keeps me engaged very very funny and insightful i would recomend it to anyone this is my last semester and i am very glad i signed up for this class
3.0,W,very nice but not a great prof you spend the whole class trying to write down notes from the overhead while she talks about someting else before she whips them away tests are way too long for the amount of time given take this class if looking for an easy a
4.5,W,she was great i think of anyway she could have possibly made it easier she gives you all the lectures on moodle she tells you exactly what to study for tests gives you practice plus interesting as you can see from the pic being present really into utilizing online tools
5.0,W,very informative and obviously knows what doing after you get to know her she becomes a really great person to talk to whether the questions are about her classes or others unrelated to her at all
5.0,M,the best prof ever he changed my life
3.5,M,very good teacher knows his stuff must show up to class be late not fond of that if going to miss a class let him know uses email alot so check it often definitely do the readings or be lost in class
1.0,W,dont take any of her classes
3.0,W,when you write out an answer to a question on her tests please write an eassy you will get an f if you do not do that why is she the head of the department in the first place there are many other qualified professors that should have that position
1.0,W,recommend not to take her it takes forever to get grades back and you can forget about e-mailing her sometimes she never replied back very rude and unorganized
3.5,M,the class curriculum is very interesting but i say he teaches in the best way he talks to his classes as if a parent lecturing to a thirteen-year-old the type of professor who always thinks he is right so he is very critical of his students work
4.5,M,peter bloom is one of the hardest graders in the music department but a fantastic professor the exams are based mostly on listening so it is much more difficult for nonmusicians it is important to ask questions challenge him and go above and beyond for his class music majors should take a class from him before graduating
5.0,M,he is one of the most intelligent and well-informed and not just about his subject matter people i have ever learned from i think his class is extremely informative on the subject of music and world politics and history yes his listening exams are hard but as long as you study for them well you will do fine this class is worth it
3.5,W,this class is highly recommended the tests are fair so go to class and study she is a good teacher and uses a lot of examples just hope that the ai grading your papers is fair as well
4.5,W,although she is a very difficult teacher she is always there to help she is one of my favorite professors i have had highly recommend as long as you are prepared to attend class
5.0,W,honest to god the best prof had very intelligent and extremely helpful you help but like her

5.0,W,prof p is the best to those who said she was biased only biased against people who care about the show up i recommend the class to people who interested in advertising or people looking for an easy a but if you show up hand in decent work and participate a great prof and you will do well
5.0,W,dr farrer is a great teacher and really cares about her students attendance is not mandatory however if you miss three or more classes points will be lost from your final grade class is easy and the teacher is great

1.0,M,if you have to take intro to physics take it at fccj basically do not take garner for intro to physics he is horrible the worst professor ever had
1.5,M,very inconsistent and unclear adds unnecessary things that trip you up very intelligent man horrible professor writes his own textbook for intro physics basically useless maybe not used to teaching introductory courses do not take him for intro to physics
1.0,M,most definetly the worst professor ever had i am a straight a science student and failed the first test the book is impossible to follow he wrote it and is littered with mistakes he treats intro physics students as if had physics before i can usually learn from the text if the professor is horrible but he wrote the book too
5.0,W,i had dr nodine for printmaking i and while she nearly killed me in design she was awesome in this class have to work hard outside of class in order to finish your projects on time but work actually enjoy obvious nodine adores teaching this class take this class if at all possible funnest art studio class ever had

5.0,M,where you guys attending the same class as me he is one of the best teachers i have ever seen at mcgill his classes are interesting and he values what every student has to say in his classes they should clone this guy and replace many of the duds mcgill currently has in the management faculty
4.0,M,a little surprised at the comments on here lank is a passionate dedicated thoroughly engaging prof i was impressed by the dedication he exhibited to his students he regularly spent minutes after class with me discussing issues that were only tangentially related to the course as ebert and roeper would say two thumbs way up

2.5,M,dr schreiber is a very intelligent funny man but he has no teaching skills he spends the whole semester talking about completely irrelevant topics you will be required to learn the material on your own his exams are extremely difficult but it really matter since he curves them anyway total waste of time and money
1.0,M,worst professor ever had his class was a waste of my time and my money he never actually taught anything he just went over possible test questions and gave you the answers every day i will never take him again and you either if you actually want to learn
5.0,M,great teacher very clear on what he wants and will help you anytime on any of your assignments and answer any questions even if its not related to the course very passionate about what he teaches and concise and considerate about everyone in the class

1.0,W,absolutely aweful uncooperative and unwilling to help students set in her ways and overdue for retirement

4.0,W,she seems nice but some of these posts make me wonder heard a terrible story about how the teacher i was observing let another kid who was observing him off for a day to take care of his sick girlfriend or something lasater found out even though this teacher insisted the kid stay home and he was booted out of the program ouch
3.5,M,he kind of trails off when he talks not that a lot of what he says is important to take down gave us his powerpoints and the tests were open but you had to voice your opinion on those as well just go on about how important children are to you
2.5,W,lectures were horrible prefer reading the text than to keep up with her she keeps us in class way over lecture time we have other classes to attend not very good
3.0,W,agree with others she favors some students over others her lectures are clear but not exactly like the book she goes into details with her experiences and knowledge it is good sometimes but bad when not relevant to exactly what to study for the exams overall an average professor
5.0,W,what are you people talking about an excellent course and an easy marker i learned many cool new things in her class do well if you do your research and always check structure grammar and spelling before handing something in
1.0,W,teacher from hell everyday in her class is like torture to your brain this teacher gives so much work end up going nuts cmon not all of us are geniuses and scientists were just taking anatomy as a prereq if ur a nerd take this class ut if ur an average b student avoid her
2.5,W,tuff teacher but she wants u to learn if ur lazy and are not willing to study and learn the material do not take this class it is hard so do not blame teacher for ur lazyness
5.0,W,my favorite class last semester i even sure i was going to like theatre but she deffinately changed my mind as long as you go to class you should be golden and ofcourse watch the plays that she assigns and you should be set like she really is an amazing teacher take her
5.0,W,i adore ms mcafee i imagine anyone not loving her class pretty easy as long as you show up and pay attention
1.5,M,currently enrolled in his class which i already took at another college do not take him he is a complete waste of time assumes you already know the material and is just giving you a refresher you will have to read study and learn on your own be prepared to spend many hours re-reading chapters and figuring out the material on your own
1.0,M,i hate this class im an accounting major and i havent learned anything from this class when i walk out of class i dont even remember what was talked about in class the only good thing about this professor was his stories but other than that i dont like him as a teacher
3.5,M,he has a terrible attitude to students especially to those who come late to class his tests are very tricky but he appears to be knowledgeable he requires a lot and those who are willing to learn will be thankful they took his class
1.0,M,i would highly advise not taking this professor he is rude to students he will go out of his way and disrupt class to call a student out on being late he thinks students should know most material already the way he pronounces words such as tissue are ridiculous he is not there for the student students are afraid to ask a question
1.0,M,are you joking never ever have i had a professor who i hated going to class with the way he explains things are ridicules you dont even want to ask a question because he will make you look bad dont take him
3.0,M,very knowlegeable professor you can tell he loves teaching anatomy be late to class or he will make fun of you his tests are straight forward make sure to study the study guides he gives for each exam you will get an idea of how he words his tests
3.0,M,an interesting fellow he is hard but lets face it a complicated subject often difficult to tell the difference between him being serious and joking dont be late unless you want the entire class to know your business if he tells you things be on the exam dont believe him cramming is not an option
5.0,M,great professor some students say everywhere in his lecture but the truth is he is very precise and he tells you exactly what he wants you to know the class is difficult but he makes it light by injecting jokes here and there if ur serious about learning anatomy take him coz he knows what talking about
3.0,M,i think bob vandergrift is good guy his lectures went off track quite a bit he is unclear at times and is extremely mean if you are late to class even on minute you might as well not even come if your min late he enjoys what he teaches but i recommend going to another instructor
3.0,M,you have no choice coz he teaches all sections and its a basic requirement to enter the nursing program pay attention to his lectures coz what he says will be on the test it is a little difficult though to filter the important information from the lousy jokes he injects in his lectures he has a tendency to embarass you infront of the class
3.5,M,took him for only lecture he is intimidating but that is just how he is he is a smart ass too seems like he is not approachable but he is if youre willing to learn hes willing to teach when he says certain things are not going to be on the test study them believe found out the hard way but got a b
3.5,M,greatttt teacher very hard but great and very nice if your serious about your class then you will pass if your not serious he will fail you hes a great bio teacher
4.0,M,i think mr vandergrift is a great teacher you absolutely must be on time and pay attention and that is really all he is picky about it is a hard subject but he tries to make it fun the tests are hard but fair and i would take him again if given the chance if you really care to learn he is the man to take he knows his subject well
3.5,M,he is intimdating his whole point is to get people who are not serious about the class out of it he will have pop quizzes when students start leaving during half time so i encourage you to stay he gives a study guide for all his test and allows notecards for test eventually which help greatly do the study giudes and you will do fine
5.0,M,he seems intimidating but throughout the sememster you will learn a lot of man knows what doing and trust me read the book before each class you will know what he is talking about in lecture and can make things fun for a subject like will be fascinated because he is fascinated about anatomy study for an a
5.0,M,dr critelli is an absolutely amazing professor he makes you critically thinking and challenge yourself beyond your expectation at every class meeting but its is very well worth it take goood notes for your notes are your study guide he is extremely helpful and if completely stuck he allows you to call is by far the best professor
4.0,W,a scorpio and an only child a giver know that after taking her summer and fall classes without a break great teacher but very demanding recommend her personally but alot of the class drops
5.0,M,his way of teaching forces the students to become an expert in the topic yes you are the one who gives the presentations so you have to actually go and learn the stuff to be informative to others also unless you are prepared to really learn do not take his class and come back and whine about his class being hard
2.5,M,make the students do the lectures and grade tests with a grading system of a doctor nobody in the class could understand what their test score really is tests are extremely long tedious and mind-bobbling going to class will not help you and needless to say he will discourage you from going into mis i switch my major after taking his class
1.0,M,we should all get his salary because we are the ones teaching his even intermin job sjsu sjsu is
4.0,M,hill knows what talking about a real good guy however his tests are nearly impossible they are way to hard i have yet to find a class that has harder tests and i only have more classes till graduation make sure to memorize every definition there is you will really need it for the tests good luck if you take him
2.0,M,he is crazy and does not give a lot of guidelines for your work but then when he critiques it he is very particular i never knew what he was looking for
2.0,W,ugh shes a smart lady but arrogant she talks to you like dumb when you ask a question she contradicts the textbook on the tests cancels classes and you pretty much have to teach yourself everything but still be wrong dont take if an elective most likely be stuck with her so good luck
2.0,W,shes a pretty good professor she gives really good clinical examples when she lectures her tests are another story you would think its going to be easy but they are straight from the licensure exam so study hard and if you must present a project to the class make sure you know your stuff inside and out ive seen her rip students apart
2.5,M,he is completely and utterly horrible he expects so much from the class but does not help whatsoever he expects his aide to help the whole time he makes the rudest comments about people using their phones and even threatened the class about it stay far away
3.5,M,class was fun many students appreciate his dry sense of humor i found him to be entertaining and a good teacher
1.5,M,pretty bad in a seminar class of he lecture for two hours with no break he literally doesnt stop speaking and its supposed to be a seminar there is no exageration here he seems to smart to beable to convey his ideas to undergrads he is not very articulate and makes simple ideas unmanageable
3.5,M,i had kumpf for both latin and greek super nice and a fair grader he gets off topic a lot which sometimes makes things confusing but always willing to work with you until you understand the material s
1.5,M,attending this class was akin to chinese water torture day after day of hearing his voice meander through the material just wore me down several things really got to me such as his method of writing a down then standing in front of it and the lack of any real structure to the class
3.5,W,extremely hard class dr lorden is a very nice funny and hyperactive professor her attitude helps hold your attention as the material is very dry the workload is quite ridiculous though
5.0,W,for starters if you have a heavy classload do not take this class between her lab and lecture it was more than the other classes i had combined but if you care to do the work and want to learn she is a good one to teach you
2.5,W,i really like dr lorden as a her class was so hard i agree with the fact that she really only wanted to help the people who were doing really were three of us that always studied together and i would do the worst on the tests but she would help the other girls more than figure but she is a fun lady
4.5,W,never though be interested in a victorian novel class but thanks to her interesting reading list choices and informative lectures i warmed up to the subject pretty quickly not an easy but rather a just marker do yourself a favor and come to class then you practically have to study for tests
5.0,W,this woman is not only a brilliant academic but a wonderful teacher this is all too rare in this dept and i highly recommend taking advantage of her dry wit insightful commentary and wonderful lectures all that and ridiculously sweet and helpful even with matters outside the course material
4.0,W,at first i thought she was interesting and painfully intelligent then i saw the final essay topic of dry dense theorists into one pg paper and was no longer a fan once i wrote the paper i realized the point behind the class and the exercise and loved her again not easy she makes you work and think but sparks is a great prof
4.5,W,marvellous professor drily witty extremly insightful and a stimulating lecturer i suspect that anyone who like her really cut out for literary theory anyway
4.5,W,shaw is an easy professor as long as you go to class do not buy the textbook i never opened it she tells you everything you need to know in class
2.5,W,a good teacher very good at what she does but pretty y and often misses class or things come up in personal life
4.0,W,i am not an art history major but i found this class to be very interesting there is a lot of memorization required which can be time consuming i think she was that hard with grading especially if you take notes and study them before the exams since all of the questions come straight from the lecture
5.0,W,best math teacher i have ever clear on every topic is willing to sit with you and help you would def take her again
1.0,W,quite possibly one of the worst at eku she shows favoritism biasness and her personal opinion is easily swayed in either direction by gossip and the opinion du jour she cares little for her classes and her students worked with her esl students and watched their scores fall as a result of her program do not take any of her classes
2.0,W,dr allameh rambles on wild tangents if you like that kind of thing great you can earn an a if you do all the work and if she likes you take an interest in what she talks about ask her for extra resources
1.0,M,do not take his class unless you want to rip your hair out for an hour and min he is so delirious he talks about his life stories the whole class and anything unrelated to what we are supposed to be learning which makes the tests only thing i learned about psychology is that the more i listen to him the dumber i get
2.5,M,he is an extremely sweet and cheesy old man but unfortunately also a total snore psychology should be an interesting course and he just present information in an interesting manner almost impossible to take notes on anything he says
4.5,M,i took psych class when i was a junior in high school and he was nothing but helpful and willing to do extra for his students he is funny and keeps class interesting
3.0,M,shel gives psychology the reality kick it can be hard to read his handwriting on the board he only gives a midterm and a final the final is not cumulative a paper is expected you are basically graded on attendance participation the paper and tests know your stuff a cool guy especially for the older students
2.0,M,he talks a lot and will get off on a tangent often i got an a in his class but i learn much he makes you summarize journal articles which are impossible to understand and you learn anything from them he is a nice man but not a very good teacher i learn more on the days when we had a sub
2.5,W,mary seem to care about learning fairness or knowledge as much as she cares about preening and posing in front of a room of people not a good teacher
5.0,M,he is a very helpful and nice professor
3.5,W,she tries really hard to teach us the topics but still is not really clear the course is pretty easy in the beginning but definitely gets a lot harder toward the end and the final is a killer labs are also a waste of time
2.0,W,she is nice but does not teach in any kind of reasonable way
5.0,W,she is absoluly the most intresting english teacher shes funny fair and easy if you do all the work you will write papers and watch movies and quizes if you do it youll pass put a time in to your paper and youll get on them i use to hate english but now i dont
1.0,W,she is very ramdom you can take notes from her lectures because she stay on any one topic her tests are marked inconsistantly with her own personal bias for each individual favorite person as chair person lazy is the only word that comes to mind her needs are the only one the counts
2.0,W,she is one of the worst teachers i have had she seems to be going through the change this year she is in a bad mood at least times a week and if you need clarification on an assignment she seems to careless and is bothered that you would ask if your that tired perhapes it is time to retire
2.5,W,the class started out good but then she seemed to totally get off track i have no idea what she taught us in the second half of the semester however extremely lenient grader
5.0,W,great teacher very supportive and helpful very clear how much she loves and respects children
1.0,W,she wrote the guess what be buying it however you will only read about buy it from a student who took the class last semester not the best teacher i ever had but not the worst teacher either very intelligent woman
1.5,W,wow this lady is crazy she wears the weirdest clothes and never wears two of the same shoe if you have taken algebra before this class will be simple i only went to claa for the tests and got an a because i knew the material she makes a lot of math mistakes so its hard to trust what she says she lets you retake a test if you want
5.0,W,the easiest teacher in history i never came to class never did homework and i swear she gave me an a for a test i never took the nicest quirkiest funniest old lady you will ever meet do not take her if you want to make less than an a if you do not make an a you need a cat scan
5.0,M,prof fox is very clearly interested in what teaching and his lectures are made interesting by his passion and by his fabulous sense of humor grading is extremely easy so a plus also prof fox went out of his way to work with me when i had to take the final at a different time an incredibly sweet guy
4.5,M,what to say about this professor does not stress students test are a joke very easy to easy i did not cheat but everyone else did good guy over all trys hard he just dosent hold student accountable for there work
4.0,M,extremely easy if you take a survey class with him we had one final that was take home open book and no homework fairly entertaining and down to earth as well
1.0,W,linda is very disorganized hard to follow her teaching methods leave much to be desired she help students she dislikes she openly harasses students of certain minority ethnicities and does whatever she can to thin their ranks and keep their achievement low tread carefully she nearly turned my educational experience into a nightmare
1.0,W,awful could teach the class better than her avoid like the plague
5.0,M,great teacher he has a quirky sense of humor just subtle enough to slide by half the class at am while the other half has a ever-present half smile on their face you never know what going to say next but always entertaining also very good at finding new ways to communicate new ideas to help everyone learn better
1.0,M,i have never hated a class so much the professor is totally useless i agree with everyone else and their negitive comments forget about asking for help if you have a choice take this class with him
2.0,M,i would not recommend him he is easy gives easy assignments and grades pretty easy but you will not learn a thing we talked about prejudice and stereotypes all semseter he has you do the work for him a lot of the time you work a lot in groups which is pointless for that class he is unorganized unclear and boring
1.0,M,someone say retirement because thats exactly what he needs to do sure he use to be a great professor he explain anything needs to realize somethings just can be elaborated on class has potential discussions were overall i think its probably my worst class yet here at weary of this class if you dare take it
5.0,W,absolutely the most honest straight-forward prof ever had understands the whole balance thing for adult learners great prof love her
5.0,M,well what else can be said how can you add to perfection one of the best professors ever had be prepared to work hard for your grade not handed to you on a plate for his class he should be teaching more classes and clinicals as his knowledge of nursing is precise and endless other tutors should take a leaf out of his book
5.0,M,kern explains everything very clearly and is always available for help he is quickly responsive to any email questions and keeps the class updated on any via email it is evident that he cares about the success of his students very approachable and kind very lenient grader credit available if needed highly recommended
5.0,M,great teacher i found that he was extremely helpful and welcoming to any who came to his office for help he also helped us to better understand careers in mathematics easy grader and offers easy extra credit problems
1.0,M,he will eventually be a great teacher but for now he needs a little nore experience
5.0,M,the best out of the three profs for the class he had a very good powerpoint w actual words not just pictures and he would explain each point very helpful prof love his lectures
5.0,M,outstanding lecturer cares much about his better than the other two much better looking
4.0,M,listen to the guy three comments down from mine edg is a good teacher he teaches because he wants to not because he has to its a fun and very easy class just write down whats in the margins and bold print follow the study guide and its an easy a
5.0,M,awesome professor he is hilarious great class for night students because he keeps things interesting he definitely shows his bias on everything and wants you to agree but a politician what do you expect exams-multiple choice no graded homework use the study guides and you will get an a guaranteed support revolution
3.5,M,a nice guy but he is very confusing at times he writes very quickly causing him to make many mistakes obvious and not-so-obvious that will confuse you later the quizzes are ridiculous but the final for this course is a joke
5.0,M,one of the best clases ever taken teaches you a lot and maintains interest responds well to questions and is available for help any time fair grader scales when tests are too hard and assigns very good hw problems because of him i even took phys gives extra credit wish he taught all of my classes because i love his sense of humour
1.5,W,i enjoy genetics but it is not my most natural subject i read the book for every chapter covered in this class and to be frank the textbook was rather useless for the majority of the chapters her lectures derive directly from the textbook with no explanation provided while she is rather approachable she simply cannot answer questions it se
2.5,W,genetics class is hard she puts very tricky questions on every word of exam she uses clickers so you must attend class but you cant take notes in class slides are exact copies from textbook she puts no work into teaching she is a nice person but a bad teacher you really have to study to pull an ok grade overall not recommended
1.0,W,the most horrible teacher ever she is not organized help you out and also gives no review sheet places wrong answer keys to previous exams just bad she teaches from the textbook and the exams are hard really hard
5.0,W,i wish she was still here becasue i would like to take more classes with her i loved her class and her teaching style i miss her
4.0,M,nice guy very cool obsessed with shmups the work is easy the assignments too bad you can study for the tests for or hours and get an a making the video game is awesome and the top video game creation groups get prizes like an x-box for example if you ever wanted to make a video game take his class especially w friends
5.0,M,this guy wants to make the game design course easy for you though he necessarily know all the answers you can ignore what you get on the tests as long as anywhere near passing the only thing that matters is the final project you must take that project seriously not fake like in other blow-off classes
2.5,M,nice man but the material was just too hard he was such a mathematical genius that he find a way to teach it to idiots like me who only took it for requirements recommend basic math for those who do math real good
5.0,M,mark is a great teacher he spells all the material out with crystal clarity and can answer any question that being said so brilliant that it was really hard for those of us that are only so good at calc to keep up and understand the material calc ii like a normal calc course it was intense i spent a lot of time prepping for exams
3.5,M,she has her favorites we do the same music all year long she talks badly about students quite often she is ok part of the time other times he is a completely horrible person
3.5,W,she has her favorites we do the same music all year long she talks badly about students quite often she is ok part of the time other times he is a completely horrible person
3.0,W,personally i think she puts to much time into other choirs and not concert choir choir was horrible because of this and not to mention we sang all the same songs the whole year
5.0,W,julia is by far the best teacher ever had she makes learning fun you help but want to go to class i hope she continues touching lives with her wit intelligence humour i love you julie
2.5,M,he seems to know his stuff however he wastes way too much time trying to prove everything this caused our section to fall behind to catch up to the others for the final he had to cover the last chapter with very little depth a very easy grader and overall the class is extremely easy homework is optional
4.0,W,i had her for and guess what guys peace o cake alot of these reviews seem baseless essays tests thats all are you kidin me yea we had to read a book but it wasnt that bad disregard is that spelled wrong the other ratings she is good
3.5,M,sometimes class duration was too long and unnecessary allowed late submissions for assignments slow or no response to email otherwise he was patient and straightforward assignments were vague and students would submit their own interpretation instead of using a template for consistency
4.0,M,awesome prof his class is interesting he is genuinely interested in what teaching he makes the subject matter easier to take in given the nature of the class overall one of my fav profs everrr
5.0,M,gary is an amazing prof i have never looked forward to going to any class as much as i do for he rush through info and repeats info crucial plus he makes time for his students and is always willing to help he is a tough marker but a great guy all around and soo funny you must take this class amazing
4.5,W,what a nice person she is very approachable and her lecture material is clear i would definately recommend any class with her
5.0,M,professor vyse is awesome he makes the material interesting at the level course and incorporates a great sense of humor he seems very reasonable in his grading but mostly just a really intelligent funny professor
1.5,M,horribly boring professor he spends the whole class trying to find someone who isnt paying attention or doesnt know an answer so he can humiliate them also he is very discourteous and continues to lecture minutes after the class should have ended the only way to get the guy to stop talking is to physically start packing up your books
5.0,M,professor bush is the man he makes class so much interesting by putting pressure on people to speak up
3.5,M,ethics he is a cool dude because he have a set agenda to class he assign but has a couple tests which are rather easy if you fill out your work book the material covered in class is important but what he grades more on is your opinions and your pretty cool dude if you ask me
5.0,M,ethics is a good class to take if you need an easy humanities credit i thought my papers sucked but i guess in ethics your opinion could be right so he gives you the a my midterm i thought i bombed but because i rebuttled some of the questions i got the a too what a good teacher
4.5,M,dr krieglstein is a great prof he grades based on your true desire to learn and the effort you put into understanding the material he assigns a paper based on topics found in one of his books and assigns journal entries based on reading material and movies in class deep and profound class that may change how you live your life
5.0,M,reading philosophy used to be tedious before i took this class dr kreiglstein has a wonderful teaching style and a tremendous breath of knowledge all the books he mentioned in class were great reads the classes always seemed too short and i was always waiting for class next week i would recommend this class as required learning for everyone
5.0,W,she does assign a lot of work but she is very fair if you do the work and this why called college and you make an effort do well she is very responsive and helpful i would take her again
4.5,W,i took her online principles of management class and wrote a lot of papers basically do what she asks by outlining the book and make sure to touch upon every point and get an a gives out extra credit points for adding comments on discussion board and is a lenient enough grader write the same paper and get an a
3.0,W,i took an online course with her and she does give a lot of work but if you do the work you should get most of the credit the assignments can be long and overwhelming but like i said if you do the work you will get an a the assignments can be done very loosely just writ to fill up space to her its quantity over quality you can get an a easy
1.0,W,i took her class two years ago through online biggest mistake i ever made in college she is horrible and gives too much work i sometime thought she was an english teacher while getting back the assignments i dropped out because of the overwhelming work load at her course if you are taking more than two classes make sure you have her
4.5,M,great teacher he is very clear in class and really knows his stuff he is a little intimidating because he does expect a lot from his students but his high expectations keep his students working hard worth the effort this class requires
5.0,M,great teacher not only is he adorable with an adorable accent but he goes in depth and he helps out and as long as you take notes and pay attention you are fine make sure to study your stuff and if you read the slides you are fine for quizzes text and slides for test
4.0,M,incredibly awesome guy very helpful but his expectations for a non-science major are unfair not one person in class was a business major and he expected hours per week at least for studying outside the classroom and that we study it everyday i would not take this class again given the chance plus it had a lab and lab project
5.0,W,a great instructor and really goes out of her way to help the students out i took her years ago and could still call her for any help that i may need in the field of child development of course we created a portfolio in class which has been with me since and has help me greatly to obtain a have been impressed thanks julie
2.5,M,prof definitely knows his greek but seemed bored while teaching it at this introductory level like he always would prefer to be elsewhere very gracious in allowing retests but could benefit from a bit more time spent upfront in assuring students are onboard
5.0,W,she is the best teacher ever
4.5,M,wessel really knows his stuff he teaches at other campuses as well so he seems to have experience very funny guy really gets you excited great direction if you need a little bit more help he is willing and able materials for this class were over easy which may be high not sure as this is my first art class but they were all needed
5.0,M,one of the best teachers i have ever had better than of the teachers i had at a certain unnamed private college i paid to attend wessel is articulate knowledgeable friendly and passionate about what he does he makes a class fun and enjoyable true that there is a lot of homework but come on folks college

2.0,W,tyree is a huge bore she will put you to sleep most of the time shes very unorganized plays with her laptop for half the class and talks about google earth which did not help teach anything about population and test questions are given to you before the exams but they require thorough if u must otherwise stay away
3.0,M,despite the negative comments posted on here about the professor he is a very nice guy he has a thick german accent that makes it difficult at times to understand the lesson but he makes things clear enough to understand do the homework and extra credit the tests are easier than the homework so if you pass these you should be fine
3.5,M,everyone here seems to be giving hi bad reviews but really a nice guy a little bit hard to understand but you get used to it tests are really easy and usually a big curve do the homework and get a good grade i loved him
4.5,M,i really like him atfirst he may seem offputting but really nice math is math not fun but he knows many people are taking it for the dec so there are several opportunities for extra credit he also realizes and states in class that not everyone will do so great on the second midterm and the curve will be generous a
3.5,M,although he does get a bit incomprehensible at times he is a pretty good math teacher i am rather sure i am getting am a in his class and although sometimes i go for reasons that i just want to or emergencies i never feel like i fell too far behind rock on detlef
4.5,M,a really good guy very intelligent yeah he talks like arnold a bit but funny the people who commented bad stuff about him are probably idiots who know how to pay attention for more than minutes really good guy not a hard class

2.5,M,newhart is not my favorite professor it may be because i quite enjoy aristotle and plato however been taught plato before and found him interesting so i think more because she herself is not particularly interesting nice enough and everything but when she teaches the class is pretty boring to say the least
2.5,W,newhart is not my favorite professor it may be because i quite enjoy aristotle and plato however been taught plato before and found him interesting so i think more because she herself is not particularly interesting nice enough and everything but when she teaches the class is pretty boring to say the least

4.5,W,dr priv is good she is very outgoing a little loud sometimes but she is a fun teacher she tries to learn your name even though a huge class which by the way makes people a little more shy than usual
5.0,W,dr prividera is my absolute favorite professor here even smiling as i type this so helpful attendance is a must because she place the powerpoints online take tedious notes and study everything and good ask questions about the study guides if unclear it pays off later
5.0,W,professor prividera is a fantastic teacher she answers all your questions before you ever very thorough the class was very interesting the topics discussed were easy to relate to there are exams which are straight from the notes she gives lots of examples to help you understand pay attention study sure to get an a

4.5,W,best teacher ever had very nice knows her material really enjoyed the class
1.5,M,don hood is an to all freshmen he will never compromise even if he is blatantly wrong or if he mis-graded something if you try and talk to him about your grade he will instantly dismiss you as just being incompetent this guy is a real
3.0,M,i dont understand how someone so arrogant can teach in a university and be an example when he screams at you you can see how he thiks he is cool just because of that really childish person get away from him
5.0,M,don hood is a very good instructor do not let him intimidate you only for show he is extremely helpful but be aware he will not just give you answers
5.0,M,in the beginning i was terrified of the infamous don hood but then he turned out to be quite nice he was rarely ever in lab really helpful just mess around in lab and follow the dress code and you will be fine

4.0,W,takes attendance every day need to be there very stubborn on how she wants things written her way and if you dont write it her way its wrong nice funny lady not an easy class however takes grade math and makes it very hard somehow if you put a lot of time in youll pass if not its very stressful dont go out of your war to take this cla
2.5,W,pretty crazy had favorites randomly collected homework which she spends half of class going over i recommend her
2.5,W,unless you need help an easy enthusaitic instructor if you test well in my particular case you may find yourself suprised in my situation she actually told me a little over halfway through the class to drop get a w and try again she seem to want all students to succeed there is no help outside of class by the way
1.0,W,she is clearly one of the worse professors i have ever had she understand the topic and therefore explain or answer simple questions we hardly used the book and the test were nothing like the study guide or anything we did in class
4.5,W,if you attend class everyday you do homework and come to her with your questions the class will become alot eaisier math hard just a challenge ms nelson really knows what doing and she never gives an excuse for why she explain problems plus cheerful most times by nature so that helps
5.0,W,great prior to regents and she gave a formula that works for any essay and i maxed my score i have traditionally been a poor writer
5.0,W,she is very helpful funny and can dress lol she makes class fun so the work wont seem like work she will make sure you learn the material if you need help she is more than happy to help shes great

1.0,M,to all my fellow school mates for the sake of your sanity do not take philosophy with this man he is the most egotistical professor that does not know how to lecture teach or comprehend

4.5,M,i am not sure if he is the best professor but i can definitely recommend him he makes statistics interesting and easy to understand i never got bored in his class needs to work a bit on pacing the lectures as difficult sections were rushed through
3.0,M,david perkins is a good teacher he cares about his students and is available for help whenever you need him
2.5,M,kinda cute but boring as all hell slept in his class regularly hard class and hard grader avoid

3.5,M,took it as a summer class and found it fair in each non-exam day we took a quiz found online that was easy to get in exams were fair the only sucky thing he kept us the entire hours each day we did watch some experiments so the time went by quickly no point in takin notes he everything is from the book
2.0,M,extremly boring hopefully get better with age his tests are super hard i see this a trend in the psych dept the person under me mustve been in my class cause he really did say that his grading system is the only thing that helped anyone pass the freakin class avoid at all costs
1.0,M,he give enough time to write down the slides but refuses to put them up on blackboard of not sure of copyright laws he makes things so much more complex than they need to be and his combover distracts the whole class read the book and do fine
1.0,M,i agreed with the person before me in dr stats class it is much easier you have a lab and instead you have to do online modules he only had exams and were multiple choice and open book
1.0,M,took him for statistical methods and he was horrible we had a total of tests and lab quizes if it was not for me getting straight in all my quizes in the lab portion of the class i would have failed lecture and lab are each worth i came away w a c but failed every lecture test stay away take prof hanson instead
2.5,M,he is absolutely borring i had him for forensic psych and he is borring and hard plus he is a weird professor i do not recommend him
3.5,M,you will not get a good grade if you do not read the book his lectures make sense however the test covers much more material and in more detail than what he covers in class test do come off a bit confusing if you do not know the material not an easy a class however you can pass without ever attending read the book and you will do well
4.5,M,cawley is a really good professor that knows the material inside and out he is always available and very understanding of students the exams are not easy but that doesnt mean it is impossible to get an a know concepts not formulas read the book and pay attention to his in-class examples go talk to him too during office hours
3.5,M,he definitely have a clue about how to teach a sages seminar even though you could tell he tried hard he graded papers very oddly and seemed to be evaluating them as if they were scientific journal articles which they certainly were not he was a nice guy but many people in the class felt they came away shortchanged
5.0,M,best class yet at ssu i can see the results of his teaching in my work and in all of my classmates everyone has moved a big leap forward easy personality knows his stuff
4.0,M,mark does expect a lot out of his students but he just wants you to succeed always there to help and you can learn a lot from him if you choose to do not take this class unless you are interested in painting and have done it before even though the class was hard and time-consuming it was definitely the best class taken at ssu
3.5,W,she was very sweet and would help you if you needed it but her tests were very hard almost all sentence translation so if you arnt good at that then dont take this class
3.5,W,i really enjoyed her class i loved making the journals and the autobiographical writing combined with art so if you like that type of thing the class is great but at parts of the class things did get really repetitive and she had a problem with changing assignments last minute after already completed things which is uncool
2.0,W,she is amazing and so so nice almost everyone gets an a in her class literally very easy teacher you would be stupid not to take classes with her
3.5,W,dr renick has a tendancy to venture off topic but if you truly listen to her lectures you will find that she is an incredibly intelligent professor not the typical egocentric prof for her life experiences allow her to function on a realistic level while maintaining a solid intellectual foundation

4.0,M,i like prof halpearn because if you wanted to get an a in the class you could i was border line an a and he let me do a book review for bonus on a topic i was interested in that boosted me to an a he grade very hard and since him a lot of professors i have had just grade by quizzes and tests so there is no extra credit
2.0,M,i was an exercise science major with the life-long dream of attending medical school and eventually becoming the first md in my family well i went by his office several times about what i could do outside of my academia to improve my chances of entry and to my surprise he told a different answer each visit reminds of a indescisive woman

4.0,M,bill ryan and his class are a nice breath of fresh air in the j-school he does have high demands and can come across as arrogant but ryan is probably the teacher you will want to know outside of class you really do learn a lot about design from him he is well respected and can set you up with a job or internship i enjoyed his class
4.0,M,very into his topics very enthusiastic and makes this class fun pay attention and attend all lectures tho

2.0,W,ok on reg assignments her tests are the problem seems she wants students to fail her exam reviews do not pertain to the test material she takes the simplest thing and complicates it to the point of confusion she constantly mispronounces words all attendance taken within the first seconds of class be late will deduct points

4.5,W,i was really interested in this class but i love psychology dr z knows tons and tons about child development and she always answered my questions strict and likes things to be done a certain way but i learned tons through this course hard material and you have to read the book inorder to pass the class
3.0,W,the class information was overall easy but it is an entry level psych course however there is a semester long research project that her class has to do it lasts all semester and is extremely annoying if you want the semester project than take the class with someone else there was no tests but points everyday in class

3.0,M,my super ego is drawn to say he is a decent teacher for moral reasons but my id says he is the most boring teacher imaginable every class he reads directly from the powerpoints and tells stuff related to material he thinks is funny but isnt to pass his class you must always go to class and complete online work if you dont get as on his tests
4.0,M,the class material is very interesting and he is extremely knowledgeable although his teaching style is a little boring you learn a lot
2.0,M,extremely boring teacher all that he does is stand in front of the room and read the powerpoints his test are pretty hard but if you study you should at least get a c on them go to class and do the online forum and they will boast your grade you should at least get a c in the class if not a b

2.5,W,if you knew spanish before taking intro to spanish be fine if you then hard luck either way it was more useful to tune her out while she taught and teach yourself from the textbook substitute her with anyone who knows spanish grammar and you be any worse off just the same i got a great mark in her class
3.0,W,a bit of a tough cookie in level she expects you to know the stuff from the intro course fair she just needs to be more explicit in her essay and test requirements people get for no apparent reason get me wrong if you know your grammar i mean know it study it be ok i already knew it so i passed

5.0,M,not only is craig one of the most experienced and passionate professors taken a course from but he is just a really really nice guy he is very laid back about grading which allowed me to explore the course material much more thoroughly craig is one of those professors who just loves what he does and as a result is rather brilliant
5.0,M,a great teacher and has become an important part of the interactive media department he knows how to motivate students and get them to look inward at themselves and question why they make art i never really thought much about concept or history before i had him really helped me to focus my voice if you taken him yet do it

4.5,W,manatu is not easy but she is fair she cares about her students and she is good i cannot understand how anyone could find this woman boring her outbursts in class have cracked me up more than once she can be harsh sometimes but because she has a low tolerance for do the work be respectful and try hard
5.0,W,this profeesor is very nice she helped me alot to look at life in a different way some people think she is harsh but is better that way cause life is not easy and if you are hungry for success she is a great help to achieve all your goals she made me realize the best thing in life is when your work for what you want
5.0,M,great teacher challenging class he is always available outside of class for help we actually published a book in this class what a great project if lazy this is not a good class for you

1.0,M,i personally like him he is not clear with the assignments he wants he give you the grades of the assignments you turn in until the end of the semester that you receive your final grade never try to reach him by email he never answers or ask him anything after class instead he wants you to go to his office
4.5,W,she keeps class fun and interesting and thats not easy to do with any lit i was one of the clowns that was always being stupid in the back of the classroom and she would let us get away with it as long as we were joking about the reading and the ssshhhhhhhhhhing girl in the back u would understand if u took the class
1.0,M,horrible professor unorganized and thinks he knows everything he is very boring and is not a fair grader the final and final paper are on the same day i beg anyone who even thinks of taking him to think again and run if you have to stay at john jay an extra semester just so you have to take him it is worth it take him
5.0,M,this professor is awsome he is a great person that knows his staff his classes are fun and well organized
4.0,M,basically a midterm a final in every classes a sheet with questions based on the chapters of the textbook is given after completing the sheets they are used as study guides he knows his stuff but you can easily fall asleep in his class
4.5,M,this professor is awesome he is such a pleasant down to earth man his class is a piece of cake you got to do a page paper and midterm n final we didnt use the book that much because the subject explains all he is not tough at all i would recommend him for any class all we did was listen he is too easy n real friendly
5.0,M,during the beginning of the course you would think he is a good professor as the course progresses you come to realize that he is a great professor very tough on his students at times but very impartial recommend him if you are serious about learning
1.0,M,prof kojo is a really easy professor to take long as you write your papers according to his own opinions if you differ with what he believes basically expect to get nothin better than a c plus you learn much in his class mostly just reviewing the daily news and talking about random issues of the day no test given

1.0,W,i hope it is the teacher im talking about she is a college prep teacher and i hope she reads this i didnt learn one thing in your class you are way too repetitive and you care too much about attendance in the first place her teaching skills are horrible half the time she doesnt even know what shes talking about conclusion horrible
5.0,W,i really enjoyed her class it was a lot of work yet it was helpful she is always available for extra help and walks you through all her assignments i got an a in her class because i worked and payed a lot of attention
5.0,W,she is great it is best to take during the summer weeks section and she only uses weeks
4.5,M,jeffrey zorn is an amazing ex-hippie grateful dead-following blustering professor he is for the most part an incredible teacher but the one problem is his quizzes he is incredibly exacting and it is difficult to receive full credit unless you are able to predict exactly what he wants to hear from you class is always interesting though
5.0,W,this is the best teacher for math ever she really helps you understand how to use the graphing calculator and doe problems in class step by step
5.0,M,coach respects opinion he encourages everyone to share their feelings love this class miss him

1.0,M,i had him for intermediate do not take him he is a waste of your time he is paranoid that everyone is out to get him and you learn nothing about ceramics in his class at this stage in my course outline i should be doing all firings myself he has taken my work and fired it i have no idea what he did or why he did it do not take him
4.0,M,steve k is easily the best teacher i have ever had in any subject he cares about his students and what they learn he is a genius when it comes to art he is eager to share what he knows and gives projects to individual students based on their interests and skills he is crazy long-winded arrogant and crazy but he loves what he does
5.0,W,before this class i really hated math but she helped everything to be so simple and clear she is very patient and the way she teaches is in a manner that even the slowest leaner can understand she will repeat the lesson again and even review before going onto the next lesson totally recommended for those who hate math and want a good teacher
5.0,W,you will not regret taking this teacher math is my worst subject and i was able to maintain a b the entire semester she is very helpful and will explain thesame thing a million times until she is sure that everyone understands
5.0,W,i hated this class even before taking it but made it so clear and easy that i can honestly say i like the class now i thank god i got her as my professor in this class i hope i get to have her as my professor in the next level of math
3.0,M,houston is cool in my book i found his class interesting and not boring either i would probably say it was one f the best marketing classes taken at rutgers people understand the capsim simulation used simply because they are to lazy to learn it
4.5,W,very knowledgeable in her field of study and teaching excellent coherent lectures that greatly help the understanding of the readings lots of reading tests were not too bad if you study enough do not have to take the final if you have a b or above by the last week nice class learned a lot
1.0,W,worst class i ever took at fit i hated bonnie absolutely hated her drop this class the minute you see her name it will bring your gpa down and you will learn nothing as a result
3.5,W,this class is not easy at all but not because of her no matter what professor you have its hard youre going to have to do more work than youre used to but shes nice and she has plenty of office hours for extra help she will reexplain if you need during class study for min everyday and you fail this is coming from someone who got a c
4.0,W,i think she was ok not excellent but ok the class was not the easiest but she did explain went over problems reviewed for the exams sometimes i think the bad ratings are from students that come to the class unprepared and then blame it on the teacher
1.5,W,honestly i hate bonnie johnson with a passion she is the worst teacher ever met she doesnt go over the work you do in your book what kind of teacher makes you learn the work yourself and do homework on what you think you learned and then go over it in class in a completely different way then the book says homework is to reinforce bonnie
4.5,M,take as much notes as possible his tests are a bit difficult but if you study your notes you can actually do good
4.5,M,he is an amazingly cool guy he is very easy to talk to and even though he does not have a lot of extra time to spare if you need help he will find time for you always
4.0,M,okay seriously buy the book you ever use it a pretty easy class a great guy and he explains everything a couple times very clearly so if you go to class be fine
4.0,M,he is as easy as they come if u pass his class u should go back to kidergarten and for the ones who understand him open up to the world not everybody in in the america for this matter talk with a country accent
5.0,M,mr howard was a great teacher laid back and easy-going the type of guy that you could go to a bar and get a beer with learned a lot from him
2.0,W,she was very passionate abt what she taught but not clear on what she was teaching and wanted for assignments overall her classes are very boring
2.5,W,if she likes you and your topic you will get a good grade on your presentation if she interested in your topic she will pick apart your presentation you can put all your time into your speech and if she like you do well very biased teacher and objective in grading
1.5,M,a lot of people complain about prof olaye but had him for two classes so far and really not that bad he really challenges you to work hard and i definitely believe come out of his classes learning more than i would have if i had taken the class with someone else only complaint is that he can be extremely unclear with assignments
5.0,M,i graduated from wpu in thinking about going to grad school at wpu to get my masters because of professors like he makes you work and think and the outcome is growth a lot of people would like to go through the motions of college and not get anything out of it besides a value out of all this money we spend and take olaye
1.0,M,by far the worst professor ever had this class was intolerable i found him obnoxious rude and useless he has us for almost hours maybe minutes of class is relevant waste of time waste of space avoid like the plague i hated everyone in the class too complete idiots
2.0,M,i have classes with him and in both of my classes we have tagged him as bipolar one minute he wants to help the next a different story the test are absolutely ridiculous they are always a questions and hardly anyone passes good luck
4.0,M,olaye has a moderately strong accent you may find him hard to understand at times but most students adjusted very quickly he is enthusiastic and knowledgeable though sometimes a little ditzy it is easy to get a good drage if you do some work i chose not to do too much work so i got a fair grade i could have easily done better
4.5,M,i was scared to take i really love this class from day one he loves to help his students he wants you to be able to think he has a lot of knowledge and is willing to share it with those students who want to get something from out of his class i would take him again for sure
3.0,M,great class very interesting lecture tardiness is ok cause he always arrives late i got a b took his class in the summer as well test are hard but if you just read the chapters write your papers you will be fine note-use power point for extra points
2.0,M,this was a stupid class you will not learn anything because he teach and he expects you to teach your classmates he assigns hw but never collects it we only went over of the chapters we needed to know for a department final learn more never going to this class
5.0,W,that was easy class and she is definitely a fun person and a good teacher perhaps not perfectly organized it would have been even more fun if the majority of the class been such idiots not paying attention not doing homework or reading the book and then whining about their grade this is college and time to grow up
1.0,M,if you are a mechanical student he is hard if you are a different engineering taking it as a tech elective very confusing and does not explain things thoroughly at all book and he assumes extensive prior knowledge in mechanical engineering he seemed liek he knew his stuff very well-but explain anything well enough
5.0,M,brilliant sweet helpful wants you to succeed and does everything in his power to make sure you do awesome guy
5.0,M,professor patierno is very nice and easy to understand class is very easy not a lot of work as long as you participate in discussions study his notes not the textbook get a good grade there are tests but he drops the lowest grade as i said as long as you study his notes ace the tests
5.0,M,a very subtle and humble man you can just tell he has so much wisdom and perspective by the way that he approaches life his class is fun educational and even therapeutic in some level
4.5,M,he is really nice and easy take him if you can
2.5,M,funny guy but his class is boring he even confuses his self at time but he is very approachable and always willing to go out of his way to help you he wants everybody to do well in his class which is a genuine quality in a professor
1.0,M,i understand why everyone thinks easy and funny a lot of times we just sat and watched movies and he gives out quiz questions abstract from the plot of the readings i talked to him about my falling grade he told me he care without giving me any suggestions
5.0,M,looney is a super funny guy and this class was really interesting it a complete blow off but it too bad just do all the sessions and study a bit the night before exams and you should pull an a i would definitely recommend him for a science gen ed there was no text book and no final
5.0,M,professor looney is the bomb he is a truly good teacher and really explains material thoroughly he is also absolutely hilarious and makes me laugh every class i would highly recommend him and this course to anyone i am far from a science-lover but this class has helped me enjoy i repeat enjoy science
5.0,M,professor leslie looney is honestly amazing i would call this my first positive experience with a science class in addition to being truly good at teaching he makes class interesting i literally lol almost every period looney forever
5.0,M,by far one of the best professors ever had he give busy work and he consistently checks to make sure that understanding the materials great professor highly recommend
4.0,W,i believe she has changed her teaching style since these last comments very into the class but its just too much for a course had to curve the mid-term and final because the averages were she would be great for a higher level course but you can definitely take an easier professor for this class
2.0,W,professora campos is nice and means well but she is pretty hard to follow she expects you to learn at a very fast pace but engage her students or encourage questions i had to rely heavily on the book and the web sam is ridiculous not a complete nightmare but take someone else if never spoken a lick of spanish before
4.5,W,she is a great professor very kind hearted lenient and understanding her class was all in spanish the thing i appreciate more than anything is she grades by the level at in spanish not by letter grades per say if you are not as advanced as others she grades you at where you are she is sooo helpful do the packets and the board work
5.0,W,she is one of the best professors on campus for someone who did not want to take a speech class interpersonal communication class she is very understanding of that the goal is not to embarrass you or call you out but to really help you learn i would def recommend to anyone also i took her class before and she still remembers me on campus
1.5,M,jc is an interesting guy but a terrible teacher makes you feel like you have to do what he wants on your own projects says everything should be simple but then wishes you had put more effort in when the finished project elaborate spends forever explaining gave me b though i followed his directions exactly and took all his suggestions
1.5,M,very confusing professor he will go on a tangent about cars golf wrestling and friends for the entire class and it becomes entirely pointless to show up when he just confuses you more i will say he is very helpful when it comes to extending due dates on homework and quizzes if you talk to him about it so not entirely bad
5.0,M,awesome instructor will not hold your hand thru the course and give you easy grade but very helpful funny does all he can to get students up to speed on trigonometry even in week course he gets to the point so we learn what we need would take this instructor again in a heartbeat the course was fast he made it fun and understandable
5.0,W,it seems as if the only people who like her lecture style are kids coming straight out of high school and looking to be entertained and have information handed to them she has a classical lecture style and she is very well versed in her field and open to questions understanding of busy schedules more than willing to help her students
2.5,M,this course is taught in conjunction with david rondel and he is amazing mima however although she is a sweet lady is not an engaging lecturer and her lectures are very difficult to pay attention to because of this definitely wish this course was only taught by rondel
2.5,W,this course is taught in conjunction with david rondel and he is amazing mima however although she is a sweet lady is not an engaging lecturer and her lectures are very difficult to pay attention to because of this definitely wish this course was only taught by rondel
3.5,W,a really nice lady and very approachable definitively try to help you out if you have any questions her class notes were a bit confusing to follow but she does her best to explain them more clearly in the tutorials overall a good teacher but tends to be confusing sometimes
5.0,M,professor pletcher provided me with two classes during my time at denison university as an exchange student behind a fairly tough facade hides a wonderfully engaged intelligent and brilliant teacher and professor his classes were inspiring and insightful and instrumental for me in determing my academic path pletcher comes highly recommded
5.0,M,you must read the assigned reading you must otherwise the tests will be more difficult than they have to be and you understand his lectures as easily he will also try and scare you out of his class in the beginning but be fooled only if you are willing to attend should you take this class excellent teacher
4.5,M,he knows what talking about and enjoys teaching his class he has a somewhat rude manner but take it personally i was intimidated to talk to him at first but when i finally did he helped out a lot just pay attention read and take good notes
4.5,M,belittling and rude because he knows what the hell talking about and you pay attention take notes from what he says and on the board ask questions if you understand something or want clarity
1.5,M,this man is to smart for community college he needs to be at a university teaching students that already have a degree not first or second year students he offer much help and talks way above students level
2.0,M,this class has nothing to do with the course description it is a web design class and i know why not being displayed as one sanders is a really nice guy but he know how to teach his tests are hard he know what doing in class and excepts you to know everything unless a mwd major take this class
1.0,M,this is by far the worst professor i have ever had he does a horrible job at explaining things he lectures you when you do well on the exams he claims the class is easy all the time which not and he is so insulting the reviews for the exams and study guides are completely useless do not take this professor
3.0,M,he is hard of hearing but very nice and understanding he easily gets off topic but is funny in his own way we learned php and c and you kinda have to teach yourself
3.0,M,he is hard of hearing but very nice and understanding he easily gets off topic but is funny in his own way the visual explanations book is hard to understand but you will be tested on it this is a web design class so be prepared to code and use dreamweaver
5.0,W,one of the best dance professors in ri the class was very fun but probably the most challenging if willing to learn she will help recommended professor
5.0,W,i loved taking choreography with her i learned more than i thought i would i was able to express myself every week with solos i got to make up the final was the best part you get to create a minute dance and perform it for an audience the class sometimes felt like therapy in a good way you have to journal on readings i am taking part
5.0,W,best teacher in the department-perhaps the college you get out of her classes what you put in if you want to learn you will if you you attention to all levels in the class whether an advanced dancer or beginner do not expect and easy a expect to write and work in the effort and the class is very rewarding andfun
4.5,W,gel is a wonderful teacher she knows a lot about dance and the theater world and she is always telling stories about famous people she knows she may come across as mean at first but once you get to working with her she is actually very nice and a great teacher i recommend taking a dance class with her
2.5,M,worst class ever super easy non cumulative exams read the textbook the night before and be fine super boring and his lecture slides are just pages from the textbook that he wrote and he just reads them out loud but he takes attendance so you have to go to class and suffer through it know how to use ulearn either
4.5,W,great teacher very willing to help the students always available for questions definitely the hardest fys on campus but she managed to make it a great learning experience i feel much better about my own writing skills than i did before this course she can be intimidating but she is super nice
4.0,W,dr davis is super laid-back and more than willing to work with students should they ask for help the reading material can get a little dry but i think dr davis does a great job of leading class discussions she is a great professor and mentor
5.0,W,awesome class i took it online and learned a lot she grades fast and is very fair she accept late work so if you are for that pick another professor as long as you do what is expected and try hard you will do well i loved this class and i found professor foster to be super fair what you learn you will utilize in everyday life
5.0,W,i took this class online i loved the program it was in snap i knew exactly what was expected of me every week i do not like the fact that the weeks are locked until current sometimes i want to work ahead and cannot she is totally responsive and very encouraging she grades fast and is fair i recommend this class for sure
5.0,M,his class is difficult but as long as you study and go to class really not that bad the lab ta is very helpful too panter cares about the class and really enjoys talking about rocks he is easy to understand i hated the class boring rocks are not my thing but definably doable as long as you give it a chance and study
1.0,M,you will be lost the entire semester he is a nice guy but is not clear about anything we know about our final exam until the week before there is not a lot of work for the class no textbook but this class was a headache he was not helpful at all no syllabus nothing
1.0,M,no just no he should not be a professor he is so clueless to everything that is going around his lectures are boring and has nothing to do with the class okay its called race and ethnicity but we only focused on black people this class was tortuous
1.0,M,this guy has no idea going on half the time he know what day it is he accidentally gave our midterm to the wrong class his lectures are pointless and you will learn nothing would not take again
3.5,M,he is cool course will have lots of project make sure you are good in matlab he is an easy grader and his tests are very would suggest to take this professor
4.5,M,lecker is awesome engage with him get to know him get so defensive about the supposed ego that everyone on here is talking about and just let him open your eyes a little you might like what you see you might not but either way taking his class is essential for learning how to talk about art
1.0,M,extremely hard class this professor knows his stuff but really know how to teach his class is extremely boring so its super hard to pay attention and stay focused as much as u try his tests are ridiculously hard no matter how much u would really avoid taking his class
4.0,M,funny professor kinda quirky but he delivers the material in a way that its interesting short answer exams that are straight forward and he give you some slack on the answers would take him again
2.0,M,good luck if you have this professor he is knowledgable but his class is so boring i got an a but by writing everything he said even his boring stories because it will be on the test read the book because you will be teaching yourself only thing good about his class is that he curves the tests because everyone fails do your best
2.5,M,the professor knows the topic however he relay them well he explains a topic in minutes and you understand it but then takes the remainder of the class over explaining it so that everyone is then totally lost i recommend taking him
3.0,M,he really knows what he is talking about but his lessons are more than boring his review is going back through the slides already seen and there any new information he gives you in review his tests are extremely hard and specific great man terrible professor
5.0,M,he makes statistics very understandable the course does not have as much math as i feared i suck at math and this class was my favorite hws which you need at least an hour for weekly quizzes worth each exams and a final regret not taking him he is the best professor for psych stats and learn a lot oh and a cutie
5.0,M,great professor stats is not an easy class but he makes it very easy to learn and understandable just make sure to attend class and do the work and get a good grade also very willing to help reading the textbook is helpful but not necessary he also allows cheat sheets on the exams
5.0,M,i love this man its impossible not to learn the material he honestly puts every effort into making you understand the material in an easy way he has such a sweet personality is very understanding stats too hard but you should put effort into listening and reading your notes completely completely recommend this professor the best
5.0,M,this professor is very understanding patient and understands his material well it is impossible for you not understand the material with that said this course is anything but a walk in the park you need to buckle down and read the textbook like its got the meaning of life hidden in it exams are a killer
2.0,M,if you want to be constantly indoctrinated with socialst ideas take this course hirschl legitimately spends most of his time in lecture pushing an agenda infuriating when the garbage spewing is coming out of the mouth of a bumbling idiot that said this class is an absolute joke and if you have a functioning brain an easy a
2.0,W,avoid at all costs nice person terrible teacher going to barely pass most of my classmates have to retake next semester only copies problems from the books and gets irritated when was stopped to explain the steps i spent a lot of time teaching myself from the book her grading system is very arbitrary too
1.0,W,do yourself a favor and do not take her class only take her if you are really good in math otherwise have a really hard time struggling very difficult to understand and not that helpful her lectures are tedious i usually write reviews but i felt obligated to for this professor because she the worst professor had at pcc
1.0,W,she is the worst professor that ever had at pcc she even answer your questions all she does is copy the textbook on the board her lecture is extremely boring avoid her if possible
2.0,W,i dislike professor browne as a person but as a teacher she is very difficult to follow along with if you have trouble in math i would not recommend taking her class too much lecture without the in class practice if for some reason you do take her talk to her one-on-one because she is willing to help you
1.0,W,not a good professor she makes the easiest problems harder than they already look also she deducts way too many points from homework and tests for a simple mistake take her at your own risk
3.5,M,do not take him if you struggle in math funny but moves quickly and erases board to fast do hw and quizzes they will help your grade if you struggle with the tests
4.5,M,moliassa is a hilarious makes math fun he often came to class with chalk all over his face always said good morning even though it was evening he was very helpful and clarified a lot of topics for me after having moliassa for pre-calc i became so interested in math that i ended up taking calculus even though not required for my degree
5.0,M,explains clearly gives time to practice examples in organized and thorough expects some prior knowledge but will walk you through when the homework he gives without checking each study guides for exams go to class-he gives test questions when only a few people show up funny knowledgable and passionate
4.5,W,professor winn is an excellent are times when she is unclear however when asked prof winn will explain until it becomes clear she also encouraged questions and was very open with after class help if you needed it she is very enthused about the material which made her a joy to be around
5.0,W,she is a fantastic prof the individual who questioned her commitment to her online course has obviously never gone in during her office hours so helpful and caring if you are going to rate a college prof you should probably spell check your submission so that it seems as if you actually have the intellect required to pass a college course
1.0,W,dr condit is the worst online professor ever had at vcu she took on a new chair role in the poli sci department and very obviously handle that and teaching go weeks without hearing from her and never has anything up on time ne i understand busy but being mia from her students is completely unacceptable
3.5,M,tests are kinda hard but he cancelled the final and gave everyone a the lowest test grade out of four including the final was dropped so it essentially counted for a third of the grade
3.0,M,he is an ok professor very nice but can ramble going to class is not necessary he posts all of the slides online before the lecture there are three exams the final third exam contains word for word questions from the first two so make sure you review those with the ta there is a generous curve on everything and extra credit offered
2.0,M,the information in this class is pretty useless but all notes and readings are posted online so no need to go to class or buy a textbook he curves all the exams even when he says he and offered a short extra credit paper at the end of the class not the most helpful professor but easy overall
4.5,W,anth of outer space is possibly the best class had denning is an absolute delight she is extremely quick-witted and can talk at length without putting everyone to sleep granted i was very keenly interested in the content to start with thought-provoking and funny her teaching style is casual but effective
5.0,W,she is amazing her wealth of knowledge is limitless she is an inspiration in every aspect of life i want to take every class she has every taught awesome honestly like technology though and still busy writing the book on the subject
2.0,M,not a good instructor he has a superiority complex makes tests harder than textbook content grades more harshly as semester progresses steer clear of this one
5.0,W,personally with most psychology classes i forget the material after a semester but i feel dr class if very different she made the topic very interesting even though my class was hours long it didnt seem it at all definitely take this class dr asplin is so nice and very direct about what she wants
5.0,W,one of the best professors to pick up as a freshman she understands kids and she is a very good teacher who makes psychology interesting
4.5,W,i find dr ability to connect with her students refreshing engaging lectures and constant feedback with her audience she is obviously passionate about education the drawback is that note taking on lectures is difficult the material is based on the ongoing changes in the legal and social society textbooks are fairly irrelevant
5.0,W,dr greene is probably the most awesome teacher had my whole life she is unapologetic about her views and she has no problem telling you why she feels the way she does with facts stats and history here in ms such a refresher to see someone push back with the norm here and really make their students think so thankful for her
5.0,M,ted a legend the man is hilarious and an amazing story teller struggled with his essays but he was always willing to help got to that final ready to ace it highly recommended great
4.0,M,professor ibrahim is extremly nice and is understanding he drops the lowest grade and funny i would definatly take one of his other classes again best professor ever if i were you fight tooth and nail to get into his class
1.0,M,bracken is probably the most difficult english professor ever taken basically for an english major he is the barbed wire fence you might want to throw yourself at his exams are based on a part a and a part b with three of the initial readings and three of the latter readings a tip for know both the conversion experience and the x
4.0,M,everything said before is true he can be arrogant and he does mark ridiculously hard but all for the reason of improvement my first essay was a c and after taking his feed back and applying it to my writing i improved a whole letter grade this is university teachers are not going to hold your hand he knows his stuff and expects you to work
1.5,M,this man is the most arrogant and self righteous person i have ever met told us on the first day of class that he assign does not give his email to undergrads because we ask stupid questions and overall makes you feel belittled this man should not be teaching english
1.5,M,definitely a very hard marker if i had known what the class would be like i would have dropped in immediately i think he would be better geared to graduate studies as he clearly dislikes undergrads from his constant criticism of them give out his email and office hours so after class help was impossible excessive amount of readings
5.0,M,great prof clear and concise and knows his stuff
5.0,M,excellent prof take his course if you put in the effort to improve you will be rewarded that exactly what this university thing is about
1.5,M,worst prof ever no one got higher than a b in the class he told us that the semester would get better as it progressed as long as you applied what learned for the term essay worth the class average was a d the kind of prof that never made it further in his field and is taking his frustration out on his students
4.5,W,she is a really good teacher has a nice personality if you attend the class regularly do your assignment and be active then you will get a high mark i like her she is the best teacher in my perspective
5.0,M,simply amazing if you do poorly in his course you have nobody to blame but yourself he teaches the material very well sticking to the textbook with full answers online also the exam questions were often variations of ones we had already through together in class
4.0,M,i kinda like this professor i can feel that he is trying so hard to make the students understand everything the bad thing is hes kinda short tempered but he did it because he cares for his students take another courses with him in the future
5.0,M,what a guy so helpful and nice if you go to his office hours and show that you care try his best to help you out thank you hassan for the great semester
5.0,M,r bender is the best financial professor in utd period take him if you want to learn something and pass funny guy and encourages questions i am not a finance guy and the class is challenging but his method of teaching helps a whole lot and helped me take you want to a finance class
5.0,W,she is an awesome prof her notes are so easy to miss a class or you will miss a lot of material and she does a good job of explaining the in-class handouts tests are all short answer so make sure you know your stuff because most of the points lost will be because of the lack of explanation highly recommend
5.0,W,greatest teacher ever so clear so precise i wish she could teach every class ever have to take there is no greatest prof not only on campus but in the whole country i am sure
5.0,W,one of the most knowledgeable professors i have ever had tests are very difficult but you can study for them write down everything she says because you will see it again miss a class because you will miss a lot of material if you work hard you will do well
5.0,W,dr sinning is wonderful she sent me pages-long emails with explanations whenever i contacted her with questions and is available outside of office hours if you need it no doubt this is a tough class but if you work hard and ask for help you will be fine miss class or you miss out on a lot
4.5,W,she is very nice and caring help you when you need it so far this class has been easy yet full of information i would take her again if i could
4.5,M,not terribly compelling material to teach but prof giarratani augments it with topics relevant to his students lives exams and quizzes are very fair and recommended practice materials seem abundant try to pay attention to lectures though because he may test some details directly from them
4.5,M,prof g was a good teacher the lectures were mostly a review of the readings but goes in a bit more detail tests are fair and fairly easy if you understand the concepts he is trying to teach
2.5,M,his class is easy in the sense that it is easy to pass it is very very hard to get a good grade but if you just want to pass this is your guy
1.5,M,curtright has got a great sense of humour but this class is lecture-based and unless you have prior knowledge on each topic you are pretty much going to sleep through them it is nearly impossible to link the outlines to the text he use the textbook for assignments but without supplement to his lectures you will do poorly in this course
2.5,M,teacher thinks he is hilarious and tries to get everyone to give him a courtesy laugh almost every minute of the class his test grading is ridiculous if you have his exact same opinion on the writing portion you will fail
2.0,M,if you find history boring do not take this instructor he lectures the extensive material tells you to read the book no study guide no test review nothing to help out the students he seem to care if you pass or fail he just likes to talk about history very dry and boring lecture style
5.0,W,she is awesome lets you retake your lowest grade for the final if you want to she gives great videos im not good at math at all and i understood it with her
5.0,W,taken multiple math classes at tcc over and over again because they are so difficult for me to pass i should have just taken and with dameron from the beginning she got me to pass math and actually enjoy it too she is an amazing professor take her if math is a struggle for you
1.0,W,terrible teacher we spent all class discussing current events instead of the history suppose to be studying you basically have to teach yourself the material the only time she goes over it is after you take the exam on it at that time the point anymore also she gives tons of homework i love history but this was a bad experience
4.5,W,take this class she gives you all the homework and tests in advance you do need to use the book but only because the answers are right there you need to read it she gives you the page numbers the tests hard open there is something due every week but not a lot and you can work ahead recommend this class
5.0,M,great guy who cares about his students he will do anything to help you and is very approachable
5.0,M,professor burk is the nicest guy ever he genuinely cares about how you are doing in his class and he will go out of his way to help you understand concepts if you need the extra help he also will even stop during class to check and see if anyone needs clarification take him if you get the chance
5.0,M,professor burk is the best mathematics professor you will ever have extremely helpful and really cares about his students very fair quizzes and exams gives a lot of homework but it helps with factoring in your final grade
3.0,M,tim is a great guy and loves what he does i had him for fye and he has different dynamics from the other teachers he was never very clear on any assignment but loves what he does and always wants to keep on track in class easy

1.0,W,a giant critic teaches the class as if she is constantly getting high on her powers to critique and judge rather than teaching the students to learn she teaches the students to memorize and judges based on how well the instructions are memorized may be describe as cool but as far as a teacher goes i recommend

4.5,M,i first took this class with robert ridge both professors are good and give good demonstrations but matheson did more demonstrations and his slides had more images as a visual learner that was very valuable to me i understood much more in his class tests are in class i recommend him to students who are single parents due to his flexibility
4.5,W,knowledgeable professor the material lends itself to dryness because much of it is a repeat of material studied in several other mcc classes not a demanding course if you stay on top of the materials and screenings i enjoyed the class her structuring of the class and her dry wit

3.0,M,hmm he was alright knows a lot about what talking about and the topics were interesting but no good notes provided at all and way too much time spent on how to write an essay as opposed to the actual course material i learned most from the textbooks and got away with skipping class he yells at the class sometimes for stupid reasons
4.5,M,way too man unfair ratings he is kind helpful knowledgeable and a great person
2.5,M,darren hynes although whilst not always the most organized is very passionate about the material he teaches and is always willing to help his students worth taking a class or two with him
3.5,M,dr hynes is a nice professor but his classes seem unprepared and disorganized however he is very clear and sets his expectations the material is not hard but some of it has to be self-taught this class would have been much more engaging if he prepared his lectures but overall it is not a difficult course and is very interesting
2.0,M,hard to make history of witchcraft uninteresting but this prof does not seem to even know what talking about half the time he does not respond to students questions effectively and does not prepare lectures well he usually just ends up reading out of a book or showing us useless movie clips easy to get extensions on papers though
3.0,M,a nice guy but his lectures much beyond average if you have an interest in the subject he can be a really helpful guy but to the uninitiated his lectures seem a bit dull
5.0,M,year classes are easy upper year classes require a lot more investment in time a great guy and prof i went through some tough times and he helped me out more than most he knows his stuff cold
5.0,W,easily the best isom professor i too have had her for semesters straight and her classes have been extremely rewarding serious in course work so expect to work hard for your grade while building useful skills for your first job she goes out of her way to make sure you succeed put forth the effort and return it tenfold
5.0,W,one of hardest working professors at ball state always very helpful with questions you may have and grades assignments very fast she makes an active effort to get her students interested in is and the course always responds to emails very quickly attendance is mandatory but every student should have her as a prof before graduation

5.0,M,i genuinely loved class very insightful he had a lot to share in great material and also personal experience highly recommended
1.5,M,i am a senior at nyu and he remains the worst teacher i have ever had at nyu horrible avoid at all costs history of media and comm with moran is a class that makes the quality of education at nyu look pathetic
2.0,M,worst teacher i have had at nyu ridiculous paper guidelines and horrible grading tactics the point of this class is not to learn the point of this class is to try to guess what he wants you to write and write about that you are required to attend class and my grade was actually dropped a grade because i missed two classes more than allotted
1.5,W,grades students work against each other not against a rubric has student groups teach subjects for the highlight of the course class only covers the easiest theories that learn better in other comm classes super easy workload and be fine this course is about pleasing her so just play her game
5.0,W,students actually teach the class most of the time with group presentations ferrante has no problem with interrupting a presentation to put in her two cents but her comments are always helpful very easy class
1.0,W,i am an older student who takes her classes seriously and this was the worst class i have ever taken do not take unless last resort very hard and confusing barely keeping afloat
5.0,W,she has the ability to walk into a room and bring silence she terrifies me but at the same time i think awesome i have no doubt she could be mean to some students but because she has really high standards and expects you to work very hard to live up to them underneath her exterior she actually does care about students a lot
4.0,W,all of the gaming classes she teaches and the modeling class are boring she actually teach you either do nothing work on projects or watch videos that teach if you are working on projects it is pointless because you have plenty of out of class time to get them done
1.0,W,horrible professor asks about extremely arbitrary things on tests she says read the textbook but honestly you have to know the random things that she decides do not take this class
2.5,W,she is sweet and can be funny at times her accent is hard to understand but she is always willing to help other than that the class is painstakingly awful entirely lecture some videos must follow the news before class you have to study for her tests she gives you a ton of information and really like when students miss class
3.0,W,the class was mainly discussion based and movies tests are extremely curved overall she is a very nice professor and wants to give you a good grade
2.0,W,this class was a drag i imagine anyone passing unless they took spanish in hs i took and had hours of hw each day i even had to drop my other class just to keep up the material bounces from one to another and it is very difficult to digest w her method of teaching i highly suggest a study group at least i got a high grade
4.5,W,if you want easy a not an option but really an enthusiastic teacher and she knows what doing there are a lot of homework and expected to turn them in but really helpful quite generous in giving grades too and there are many extra credit opportunities
5.0,W,wang laoshi is an amazing professor she effectively uses her teaching experience to the fullest presenting the material in clear way she makes sure her students not only understand but retain the information she gives also she shares details of the chinese culture which help illuminate the lessons

1.0,M,rambles uncontrollably in general he is a nice guy but completely out of his league teaching accounting he reads straight off the slides that are all posted on sakai can barely answer questions his whole section of the lodmod project is a mess and he cant even help you because he is using another professors outline this class is a mess
2.5,W,she is a nice lady but she is not always the easiest person to follow it might not have helped that her class was only minutes long but i really learn much during her lectures i had to learn and figure out things on my own the assignments were almost all consistent of mymathlab questions that do too much but she is nice
5.0,M,mr tyson is hard in the first weeks of class flunking or catching on realize he requires dedication on some level to even slide i took bio at another college times dropped it boring grading required me getting on board suddenly the subject teacher changed everything almost later i still remember it
3.0,M,took biology and in i can say he had one of the classes that i learned a lot from taught a short creationism section along with everything was unique in that regard
1.0,M,he teach he only gives tests based on reading then talks for an hour every class he is not helpful at all and respond to e-mails when you have questions
3.5,M,enjoyable class as he is very knowledgeable on the teaching profession he regularly remind you of assignments but all due dates are in the syllabus so get in the habit off looking at it often there are online tests and online final relatively easy grader
3.5,M,i enjoyed his class he is forgetful and deadlines do jump out at you from nowhere but he is fair he listens to you and if you need an extension you got it i love dr milner
3.0,M,milner is terrible he brags about being organized but never knows what chapter on or what we have due he changes the class schedule all the time is super condescending teach towards tests or go over them and assigns really stupid assignments for seemingly no reason take him if you have the choice
3.5,M,this professor was a great one i looked forward to attending this class every week he really knows what talking about and is a great teacher there is a good amount of work and it is mostly online but if you keep up with the workthen do fine highly recommeded

4.5,W,very sweet lady but beware her exams are kinda hard you put things into your own words it has to be exactly what she says or she will count it wrong
5.0,W,very clear and tells students all expectations she offers office credit extra worksheets ungraded practice homework and even sends links for websites and youtube videos the most clear professor ever if you get a good grade in this course it is because you did not study or learn the material period great
1.5,W,i had to teach myself a lot of the time her tests are really hard because she teaches straight off of the powerpoint the online sapling homework helps a little with understanding material but i think i would recommend her she care to help you pass if your failing
4.5,W,she provides many opportunities for advancement in the class if you show up to class and study there should be no problem for you to make a good grade

4.5,W,excellent teacher common midterm for all sections and all her sections had the highest average her slides are super clear and so is her method of teacher would def take for intro to accounting

4.5,M,dr harding was always willing to help me and pushed me to do my best i appreciate him so much he was nothing but kind and generous with his time i loved the novels we read too
1.5,M,how does this man have such a high rating always unclear about what he wanted totally abstract in his lectures held us to grad school standards grading standards made absolutely no sense and showed very inappropriate video clips and mocked anyone who was uncomfortable with it did everything a good teacher would never do would not recommend
5.0,M,dr harding is one of the best professors ever had intelligent funny and he cares about his students
1.5,M,worst professor ever had ridiculous amount of expected reading unclear directions for every assignment and very harsh grading a nice guy but he does meet you at your level he acts as if everyone has read the texts as much as he has he just read off a piece of paper and care if you were learning or not i learned nothing
5.0,W,i wish she was still at el centro i miss her and they need her here she is the best instructor they had here
5.0,W,tough grader but very fair she knows her stuff for sure and will help you out if you seek it
1.0,W,what a horrible prof she expects everyone to be news writers and does take in consideration other majors she is extremely condescending and passive-aggresive she expects you to know all news writing terms even if they have not been discussed before we spent the first six weeks discussing story ideas and did not do much else bad bad bad bad
1.0,W,she is extremely condescending and that impairs her teaching ability incredibly difficult to please especially if not on her good side her lectures helpful and are extremely repetitive she ever help you with your actual writing
5.0,W,dr lueck expects well-written papers i took this in the summer and i was the only graduate student lots of reading and writing but passable she had a lot of feedback on my paper but i got an a she is enthusiastic about her subject and lectures a lot if you read the text and participate be fine

2.5,W,dr rose is a nice person who loves what she does but she is not good at teaching a large class she goes through slides too quickly not caring if people are still writing the stories she chooses are strange and the assignments are unclear i take another class taught by her
5.0,M,amazing professor it was an honour to be taught by dr allard it is clear that he is passionate about what he teaches he is very clear in the way that he teaches and there is no room for misunderstanding visited him during his office hour and even outside of lecture he is very helpful excellent professor
2.5,M,nothing like what i heard the course was like just turned into sonnets and reviews essays are marked extremely hard and you encouraged to think for yourself you just tell him what he wants to hear i felt very confined in the class and unable to express individual thoughts on the texts very unimpressed
2.5,M,do not mess with him go to class always do the homework or your grade will be penalized make sure to read the chapters because the true or false section in his exam is worth it points avg and he takes the questions from the book if you take him for accounting you will do better overall in finance
1.5,M,he is a little rude when he talk he is not organized it seems like he never prepare for class he just comes in and talk from his experiences after this finance class i still understand stock market he only answers question but how do i ask question when i learned anything i guess the class is for whoever already know
4.5,W,only college class i was sad to see end cardozo has a huge heart and loves connecting with her students and being able to believe in their abilities inspirational and centered if you have a chance to take a course taught by her and its a smaller classroom you will benefit greatly

5.0,M,this class is stress free if you want an easy a take mr enomoto you need a textbook the final is so easy and its a take home no mid term forgot the most important thing mr enomoto lets you leave early to do your homework in the lab if you have any because he lets you do his homework in class regardless you leave early
4.5,M,mr enomoto is a really nice instructor if you want to get an a you need to take this class he lets you leave early this way you have time to go to the lab to do your homework he also will give extra credit toward the end of the semister
4.5,M,mr enomoto is a very nice instructor he is helpful and he is very easy what i liked about his class was that he would let you out early to go to the lab to do your homework if you want an a you need to take him
3.5,M,jerry is a very thoughtful person and truly understanding i have completed my music composition classes through him and he has helped me immensely often he will leave the classroom and not return for some time i have had to deal with loud and obnoxious rude classmates because of this but overall i would recommend any of his classes
4.5,M,corvino was an excellent lecturer he kept the class engaged and interesting definitely read the course pack and participate in class discussion portion seemed a bit pointless to me sometimes however the lecture itself was wonderful exam questions were confusing and tricky at time but the workload is not much
5.0,W,probably the nicest lady you will ever meet not to mention one of the funniest her lectures are simple and she goes pretty quickly but stops if anyone has questions or if she notices people are confused and sometimes stays after class to offer extra help the midterm and finally are easy and if you understand the assignments be fine

3.0,M,seriously anyone who complains is someone who just care j tarski is a little hard to understand but you get passed it after he has such a big heart tried his best to answer any questions to the best of his ability he also encourages the math res center open note take him if serious about learning
4.0,M,i took social psych from him professor milburn is one of the best professors that umb has i wish that have been able to take more of his classes work with him more closely take a class of his efore he retires
4.0,M,one of my favorite umb professors i wished he taught every psych course he has one book that he uses which is his own book and all of his other readings are online you are required to attend classes do the readings and do the mandatory posts for the readings every week aside from that you do paper a midterm and a final
1.0,M,awful professor late more than not actually teach just tells stories about how great he is worst class i have taken at st olaf

5.0,M,professor calderon is a great teacher he really takes his time in explaining the material chicano history and makes time to meet with you in case you got questions i have taken several classes of his in the past and taking another one again great material and excellent professor
5.0,M,free online text professor damen is amazing the content my favorite but he is very enthusiastic and knowledgeable about history not unreasonable amount of papers he wants everyone to succeed and will help you succeed the tests are a little challenging but studying is the key useful audio and powerpoints great class overall
4.5,M,damen is an excellent professor very excited about what he teaches you will have to write several papers but they are short and he is an easy grader he delves into lots of really interesting stuff in his lectures great class i would recommend it to anyone
5.0,M,this class is fantastic by far one of my favorites professor damen get really into his lectures it great and he is always very helpful if you study and do the work you will pass no sweat only thing to watch out for are the essays he is very picky about the essays andif you have to reprint it it off automatically so be careful
4.0,M,he was definitely one of my favorite professors he was funny and kept your attention all through the class although attendance is not mandatory it is best to be there he covers a lot of info class that makes it easier when reading the book it is a bit of challenge but not too bad
5.0,W,professor allen made it extremely easy to break down medical terms you always know expected on the tests and if you have questions she is always available
2.0,M,i wouldnt take a class by him again unless it was free he just wasnt a good teacher acted bothered if you tried to contact him i did take the class online so maybe it was that but the class wasnt too hard just a lot of memorizing medical terms
4.0,W,not as hard if you study her notes and take notes on any keywords and points she makes during lectures just pay attention i got extra points on all of my papers and projects and most of them were done last minute however so hard on attendance that missing classes last semester dropped my grade a full letter which was very frustrating
1.5,W,her class was extremely boring and i am an art major the class was easy but there was a lot of assignments as long as you do all the assignments on time and always show up to class you will pass i never talked in there because she will make you feel stupid i know a lot about art but she would make me feel so dumb for sharing
2.5,W,very boring class she seems like she really come off clear a lot of times
5.0,W,i took this class online it bad at all you get extra credit opportunities it is very clear what she expects of you if you follow simple directions it will be reflected in your grade
3.5,W,i took her online class wow she expected more writing than my english comp class did graded fairly easily on discussion posts but her tests were pretty hard i finished up with a b

5.0,W,this class was hard for me but i been in school or used most of the material covered in real life in years she was very helpful was always able to explain how to do the problems when i got stuck there is a bunch of homework tests weigh for of your grade as long as you do the homework you have any problems with tests
3.0,W,mrs mcvey is very smart but has no idea how to explain her knowledge she does not allow you to use a calculator the whole first half of the class her tests are extremely hard and consist of most of your grade the homework will take you hours and hours a week which count for much she is a nice person but i would not take her class
5.0,M,super easy class if you like math he will help you any way you can i took him for and now
4.5,M,conrad is not as bad as the reviews took a night class and he was always concerned with the students understanding the material before continuing to the next assignment we used mathlabs for all the hw and quizzes so a lot of self learning and studying but conrad did teach well in my opinion funny guy too would take again
2.5,W,maybe she is different on campus than online i took online she did not seem to care or be helpful at all so far she is the teacher i am most dissatisfied with i had a great gpa and made mostly before making my first c in her classes she seem to have any care that some people work full time
1.0,W,had her for an online course never had a professor who was less helpful i emailed several times for clarification on specific types of problems and she told me spend more time studying when i was already spending more time on this class than my other combined would not recommend her for an online class

5.0,M,i had prof muldrow for math and computer and he is very easy to talk to he is funny in a goofy way he is very helpful you just have to ask i have had three of his classes i wish i could take my last math class with him i truly recommend taking whatever classes he is teaching
2.0,M,i am in his online class right now and i hate it he rarely sends out emails and when i emailed him about a test it took him over a week to reply it helpful at all his tests have nothing to do with the subject although you do have the option of taking it twice if you want maybe better in person i take him again though
1.5,M,i took online with him i did get a b but it was endless hours of busy work having little to do with understanding the subject he accept late work and any questions if answered at all were answered after the assignment due date had passed rendering them useless i would not recommend him or take him again
4.0,M,took his class while still in hs gotta take him in person his tests are hard and he makes questions almost impossible to get right bc his actual philosophy of what psych is researched dsmv for a book of opinions and there are no rights or wrongs he convincingly reinacts symptoms of disorders briliant fun
4.0,M,took this class online his tests are very hard on the homework assignments being very detailed increases your grade make sure to follow instructions carefully on research activities or you will lose major points i enjoyed the class though and would take him again
4.0,W,i felt that she really help us out at all online we essentially taught ourselves from the textbook then on top of that she would make of the test about things that covered in the textbook how are we supposed to know these things if we are teaching ourselves
2.0,W,this class is not recommended she expects so much from her students but teaches so little prior to the work supposed to do take the class if you already know how to program but beware for she takes points off if you program the way she does
1.5,W,professor malaty has a very poor teaching structure from day one she expects you to know how to write a program and she annoyed when your asking her for help only take her class as a last resort
1.0,W,i never felt the need to write a review about a professor until taking cs prof malaty is quite possibly the worst teacher ever experienced she comes to class unprepared and is annoyed by any question being asked even if crucial to the lesson i got an a after thoroughly reading the book and collaboring w other students stay away
2.5,W,ignore her lectures read the book she is well-meaning but her lectures are abysmal i got fed up and just resorted to relying on wikipedia for key terms and concepts a full semester later and i ended up teaching myself very exhausting for people not familiar with programming
1.0,W,whe it comes to teaching the students she is all over the place if you are a beginner you have to rely solely on the textbook not helpfull whatsoever and she seems like she come prepare to class she is very forgetful and if you try to follow relize that you are being misguided unless you catch it or someone else in class does
5.0,M,i am not sure this is the right class for mr martin to teach i felt that most of the class was confused on the overall subject he did give his all and was very nice and definitely knew the teaching us the information was not clear enough that may be because of a student who kept disrupting the class
4.0,M,great guy always willing to meet and help out super funny made class worth going to wish he was still at lu
4.0,M,i loved kurtz he is actually the best professor i have had in my total education career his passion for teaching makes you want to be in class he writes comments on papers that are hard to read but he is pretty clear in his office hours and class time about what is expected he is an amazing professor and you have to take a class with him
3.5,M,not hard what you are supposed to do for projects may seem difficult but as long as you just cover exactly what it says in the directions get on them tests are online recommend reading the chapter only before test do not need to otherwise super approachable and very understanding class can be boring but worth going take him
2.5,M,he was a nice guy but not my favorite professor his tests were online but i never felt like i had enough time his expectations on assignments were unclear which made it difficult to get an a
3.0,M,this class too bad his tests can be a bit tricky but they are all online which is nice i would not recommend procrastinating on the projects they are not hard but they can be time consuming he tends to go off on weird tangents so sometimes we only get through slides in class but overall he is fairly entertaining recommend him
3.5,M,i really enjoyed the assignments and the structure very spacey while her feedback was decent i got a lot more techniques and whatnot from my peers so your experience with her may depend on your section also find and befriend shane he will help you every freshman should do this
3.5,W,i really enjoyed the assignments and the structure very spacey while her feedback was decent i got a lot more techniques and whatnot from my peers so your experience with her may depend on your section also find and befriend shane he will help you every freshman should do this
1.5,W,jackson is the most convoluted teacher i have experienced thus far she contradicts the book and herself on a regular basis her instructions are never clear when you ask for help she is snide and rude not the most difficult material but she makes it unbearable she also is never timely on grades
5.0,M,i had dr pezzelo for justice and human rights he is amazing great guy he cares about his students take home midterm and final essays really interesting class you like hist and watch movies and discussions after got an a great class
3.5,M,honestly i took this course because it was easy but i was also hoping to learn something too get me wrong you do learn basic concepts such as being honest and how humans take things for granted but what im criticizing is the way he teaches it is frustrating all he does is complain about people and kean complains but gives no solutions
5.0,M,he is so intelligent and his lectures are very interesting all classes should be like his where you actually leave the class with knowledge about the topic and a different way of thinking
5.0,M,hands down my favorite instructor at green river went into the class not expecting much but turned out amazing he is extremely helpful and will go out of his way to help students lectures are informative and interesting very understanding of your mistakes and works with you to fix them a teacher all around
4.5,W,ms e as she is likely to have you call her is a teacher that embodies what in my opinion is the pinnacle of teaching by delving into material that is new unfamiliar or even beyond her current comprehension she challenges students to think deeply and holds herself to the same standard take her only if you desire to be challenged and grow
5.0,W,she is an amazing teacher you will learn how to whip up a thoughtful essay in no time after this class she is very personal and honest one of my favorite and most memorable teachers ever experienced
5.0,W,class was transformative she is real she genuinely cares about her students and there are no topics off limits from her class discussions be ready to grow as a human being if you take her class if you participate in discussions you will do well she is fair and understanding and does not grade harsh i loved her class
5.0,W,echoing another review ms edelson takes her students work seriously she spends a lot of time editing essays and helping her students develop their ideas she has an unimposing brilliance that inspired me to produce some of the best essays i have ever written i would recommend taking this class solely for the collage essay
5.0,W,simply put if you have an opportunity to study with rachel edelson take that opportunity rachel is a deeply inspiring thinker and human being who takes personally the development of each one of her students when you speak in class and you will speak in class she listens attentively and remembers what you share even months or years later
4.5,W,this is not your typical english class instead of dreary lectures we had riveting class discussions about shocking issues in place of monotonous grammar homework we had assignments that required opinion thought and action ms edelson has an unrivaled passion for teaching that is evident in her class without doubt i highly recommend her
4.5,W,i cannot recommend rachel edelson more highly if you truly care about learning take her class i had the privilege of taking at scc while in high school and it saved me from absolute depression about school in marked contrast to the stultifying english classes at ckm edelson really engaged and supported our critical thinking and writing
4.5,W,rachel edelson is easily the most engaging inspiring english teacher i ever studied with her classes easy because she respects students enough to truly challenge grapple with complex themes and reading material as with any great class get what you put into it so do yourself a favor and give it your all
5.0,W,by supplying our class with heated topics to write about she made it to where we just writing brainless dry essays half of class is going over upcoming assignments addressing the concerns of the students and going over useful grammar and punctuation tips then we shared thoughts about the homework we wrote short papers a week
3.5,W,two word essays due a week class starts by useful grammer tips the next hour she calls on every person to see how they feel about the topic for the essay the essay topics are mostly revolved around politics money and every once in awhile something interesting
4.0,M,dr frarris is great he writes all the notes for you and posts them online he makes the tests easy to study for he is very helpful and will talk with you on any subject that clear
2.0,M,his class is very hard and an class for me so very hard for me to stay awake the whole semester is based on exam grades and your lab grade and the exams are very hard
5.0,M,mr beals is an awesome teacher i wish he could teach all my other classes he will repeat and explain this as many times as needed also going to si is a big the si teacher is fantastic and helps out soooooo much and mr beals gives you extra credit for going
5.0,M,professor mann is a great teacher his test come straight from the power point notes the essay questions for the test come from interactive phys he gives some extra credit throughout the semester-mainly from mastering assignments you only need your book for the mastering assignments but you can use the e-text instead to save money
4.0,M,is matter what but i did like dr mann he was clear about what he expected he did not give you a study guide for the tests but he did tell you what to study for the essay questions his tests were hard but he gives bonus and easy quizzes and extra credit i did not do well on the tests but still made a b
5.0,M,d is a truly remarkable educator he is passionate about what he practices and it transcends to the students he is an inspiring professor and the writing intensive part of the course is hardly noticeable in part because we write a little every day it is reading intensive however the reading is valuable and fascinating
4.5,W,ms ruttenbur was extremely helpful in class she made it a priority for all students to participate and grasp the information she wanted us to learn the material and not simply memorize text
4.0,M,this class was super easssssyyyy but super booooring i could barley stay awake in there he does not require a lot of work which is great the professor is very bad with getting you your grades on your work so you never really know what you have in the class
4.5,M,powers is a really cool professor he cares about his students the class hold my interest a lot of the time but it was extremely easy otherwise i also learned a lot from the class though a lot of it was very random and unorganized
3.5,M,ok i will start off saying he is a good teacher and a nice dude but if you arent into chem i wouldnt take him he is really hard and yes i ended up with a b but i worked hard for it he wants to help you and wants you to make a good grade i just think hes too smart to teach kids that arent up to par with him
3.0,M,he is very hard to follow he gives a lot of in class examples on the day the material is introduced but doesnt do much review before the test i probably wouldnt take another one of his classes he is very nice though
5.0,M,take the online class if econ is one of your pre-req his collaborate sessions are very helpful he is always available via email has so far given so many quizzes more opportunities to redeem your learned a lot take it if your interested in learning and it will not be a major burden in your life
4.0,M,i took his speech class and i loved him if you have any brain you should make an a not a tough grader on the speeches because he understands that people are naturally better or worse speakers you are on your own with the test because he cover anything in the book just read the chapters over and do fine
4.0,M,just talk for the time he wants you to and do your outlines and speaker critiques and youll be good really easy and laid back watched a lot of movies
4.5,M,this was a fun class mr warner is a very animated person and clearly loves to teach i found myself cracking up quite a bit during his lectures and feeling very open in his class he is also extremely helpful with speech topics and emphasizes on wanting students to approach him with any questions comments or concerns they may have
4.5,M,personality plus loved this guy you must use the book as the test materials are not all covered in class but all test questions are covered in the sample quizzes written set assignments do not always make sense but if you ask him clarify he built our class into a great team thought hate the class wrong
3.5,M,i found him to be very animated and entertaining show up for class participate and take the online practice quizzes before his tests and you will do fine in his class the one negative i had with him is all his examples are church related so if your not a christian his examples wont make sense to you ask the right questions to get around that
2.0,M,mr warner is not very clear on what exactly he wants on many assignments it seems like just hit or miss as to whether or not you happen to respond the way he wants on the sets he assigns with questions and answers not a super difficult class some said all you have to do is the work and you will receive an a but i disagree need book
1.0,W,i suggest her to anyone who wants to succeed in math
3.5,W,easy enough to understand if you pay attention to her example but has an attitude when students ask questions allow them to finish the question makes them feel stupid with her tone so they want to elaborate on what they are actually confused on if math come easily to you recommend a different instructor
4.0,M,he is not an easy teacher and comes off as harsh at first but he is extremely helpful he deeply cares about his students and wants them to do well as long as you follow his instructions for the assignment you will do well he is always open for questions i would definitely recommend taking his class
4.0,M,a good instructor highly recommendable for eng class if you want to make an a he also dash out points in order to help you have good grade he is good
4.0,M,a very good instructor he is highly recommendable for english courses
4.5,M,not an easy class but if you do the assignments just as he has instructed you to do you will do fine if you have questions about his grading just ask him about it he deeply cares about his students especially those that care about their education participate in class to get bonus points they really add up at the end of the semester
3.5,W,overall she is a pretty good teacher as long as you read and do the work get an a i learned a lot in this class we only had to write one essay do one seek assignment and take three quizzes do the work and show up and be fine
1.0,W,i hate her
2.0,W,lectures are confusing and boring i gave up on going at all a looot of readings too however tests are multiple choice and super easy if you keep up with the readings and do her handouts there are papers overall an ok class pretty easy to get a b if you put a little bit more effort in you can definitely get an a
1.0,W,so hard to follow her lectures every time i actually went to class i ended up not being able to take any notes because she speaks so unclearly tests are pretty easy though
5.0,W,such a wonderful lady the textbook she used was very relevant and great for the class she was very relatable and understanding
2.0,W,tons of readings and she often goes off on random rants about life this quarter her favorite lines are be spongebobs or walking dead sometimes going to lecture is totally useless but then there are other times when she is focused and actually the readings
1.0,W,oh no forget this lady she made my life hell never take any class with her a warning her lectures are boring as hell she only gives her opinion and give actual facts her exams are stupid pointless i honestly know how she became a professor just take her especially all the reading she makes you do is a bit crazy
1.0,W,her lectures are absolutely pointless the only real reason ito go is for the handouts she would give she claims cares for critical thinking yet the midterm and final are multiple choice the amount or reading is absolutely ridiculous the amount of reading is absolutely ridiculous trust me and please save your self take this class
4.0,M,nice guy joined his freshman seminar on accident poems a week and if you go to his favorite poetry club buy you sweet potato fries
5.0,W,love this professor her voice is soft and monotone but she is wonderful

4.5,M,best professor i ever had nearly convinced me to change my major to sociology he made a couple of the most difficult classes i had also the most enjoyable arrogant yes charming yes inspirational that too probably would have inspired me to like algebra too if he had taught it
4.0,M,straight facts his tests are difficult he usually never has on which class you take he will share information or images from criminal minds with you that you will find no where else and he will make you grow as a major he is hard but necessary attend class and you will pass excellent professor
1.0,M,this is the worst professor had in my entire college career i am an a student but never been so frustrated he drones for hours about nothing but expects us you to know everything plus stuff he covered come test time he is not helpful and is arrogant the study guides for tests are also over pages with uncovered material

5.0,M,he had this peter parker clark kent quality about hom that was sooooo sweet his class was awesome
4.5,W,carmean makes it very clear what is required to get an a if you do what she says and do it well an a is pretty much guaranteed take good notes carmean really loves this subject and she enjoys it when students express interest or enjoyment as well if you go into the class with a good attitude go a lot better
4.5,W,she is organized in her lectures and her assignments are pretty straightforward take notes of whatever she mentions in class she grades students on participation too so make an effort to participate in class daily her exams are based on lecture material covered in class so attending class is very important

5.0,M,shelly hancock is one of my favorite instructors here at bctc she is so lively and passionate he classes are almost never boring sometimes in her class i felt as if my older sister was teaching me she is just so friendly and fair she gives you a hard time on essays but because she cares about you she wants you to become your best
5.0,W,shelly hancock is one of my favorite instructors here at bctc she is so lively and passionate he classes are almost never boring sometimes in her class i felt as if my older sister was teaching me she is just so friendly and fair she gives you a hard time on essays but because she cares about you she wants you to become your best
4.5,W,she is one of the best teachers so far she is very helpful when she is grading she comments what is wrong about the paper so it will become better very wish i had taken her for but sadly i
3.5,M,dont take him u will regret it if you care about your gpa his class may seem easy at first but its really not he tells u what will be on the test before hand but most of the things he says are not even on there totally not worth it
3.5,M,academically i would say a great teacher to take but he is a shady person he started a conflict in the class with a student who did nothing to anyone i guess he agree with his point of view but sending a email off to everyone in class like your trying to get the person kicked out of school which is what he did was a bit extreme
5.0,M,take this guy he is one of the best professors i have ever had i learned so much from him he is extremely funny and he will tell what is on his exams even on my exams in the free response section there were times when i made up the answer and i was still given credit like i said take this guy
4.0,W,lecture-lecture-lecture it sounds boring but if you stay awake in class and read a few handouts never need to open your book or study what you hear is what you get so just sit there listen and get an a she likes participation and truly old school so show some respect and understanding for her style and read your syllabus
1.0,W,worse teachers ever very confusing she be all over the place very hard to understand if u into this the teacher for u
1.0,W,i am not a fan of history so her teaching made it a little harder to like it she takes weeks to just get through pages and we would have an exam in week and barely covered the chapter what she reviews does not match the test when you take her class just read ahead of the class to past the tests she is a nice lady but not a good teacher
1.0,W,the worst teacher ever had hands down she doesnt start her lessons until weeks into the semester and she grades by how much she likes you i made all and on the and somehow i ended up with a c in the class expect to gain anything from this class how does this woman have a job
2.0,M,dr bosworth is a very kind brilliant man the definitions killed on the quizzes and final but he does grade very generously my advice is to go over previous class assignments and dedicate a couple hours a week to go over the notes and really memorize the material
1.0,M,sorry but bosworth is a horrible teacher this is my second time taking computer organization and again the whole class is failing do not buy the book because he teaches directly from his slides his tests are unorganized and he hates answering questions try to find another study buddy that can help you because he really wont offer much help

4.0,W,tests were easy for someone with science background and study slides hard if you do not pay attention stickler on class etiquette you will get a good grade on the papers if you include everything she requires she gives you a rubic wants to be able to read the paper without trying to figure out what you are trying to say
5.0,M,hands down one of the best professors i have ever had has a true passion for teaching and explains everything very well so that anybody could understand the material very willing to help you with anything class even if he does not teach it i wish all professors could teach as well as him
4.0,M,very reasonable professor he made the class enjoyable would find a way to relate material to real world application
3.5,M,tests really covered what he lectured and homework assigned great instruction and very willing to help
2.5,M,definitely knows his stuff but has seriously high expectations for students i like history lsm am studies and worked really hard went to office hours did the readings and simply get an a on anything he was not helpful when i asked him how to improve on future assignments hard exams and hard on take
4.5,M,knows a lot about history and admits that most of what he knows is useless knowledge read and outline the textbook and be set for the exam if interested in history take advantage of his strict grading and higher expectations of students if you like history take his class
5.0,W,trish is awesome she is one of the best pe teachers ever had she is not only very skilled but funny and really cares for her students she creates a workout routine based on her students needs easy to get an a if you attend her class take her i will sure take her again

1.0,W,i went over a homework problem with this woman we went over it twice and she told me everything was correct i turned it in and when i got it back i got points for that same problem that how she grades i strongly recommend you not take any of her classes
1.0,W,never take her thanks god not teaching next semester because i have to retake her class makes students feel stupid which immediately drops my interest in the class very hard grader to a ridiculous point and gets confused in her own words which confused everyone because we even know how to approach the problem horrible experience
1.0,W,do not take her class she made things so much harder then they needed to be she makes you show work for every tiny detail simple adding and subtracting i listen to a review i read and took the course listen to this one and dont
1.0,W,god awful teacher do not take this instructor she does not explain anything well you are better off reading the book yourself then even going to lecture pissed i even payed for this quality of education it would not be worth my time if it was free
2.0,W,very hard teacher i get straight in my previous math courses in college but could not learn from her very picky should have dropped earlier to get a refund but i decided to stick it out dropped just before first test as i knew she teach me only concerned with getting through material not how well she covers or explains it
1.0,W,not worth driving to make it to class when all you need is the book in her class she doesnt teach and expects you to just know it she also expects hours every night for homework grades are based on tests
1.0,W,absolutely horrible she know how to teach she teaches word for word out of the book and when you ask a question she answer it avoid this professor if at all possible if she want to answer your question she will yell at you and kick you out totally pointless to even show up for class i can teach better than she can
1.0,W,judy is a horrible horrible teacher i am actually confused on why she even has a job still she teach you anything but rather plays a video of another person teaching the lesson and basically the class if you ask her a question she does not answer it pretty sure i could teach the class better than her
1.0,W,shes the worst math teacher ever had i feel like she know the material if she does she teach it at all her tests are not what she teaches not even worth doing the hours of homework every night because only worth points anyways she want to help or explain she yells at you if you ask for help
1.0,W,if you enjoy paying a teacher that teach and only shows videos during class because she know the material than your perfect teacher
1.0,W,absolutely the worst teacher i have ever had she makes you feel like a moron if you ask questions
3.0,M,he gets off topic very easily and spends way too much time on something that should only take a few minutes he does know a lot about his subject but he gets so distracted and tells a lot of irrelevant stories an okay class but definitely not one of my favorites
4.5,M,not there to be a babysitter so if you work hard his guidance will be beneficial along the way
5.0,M,dr baer was i loved the choice he gave when it came to which type of exam prefer to take also going to take his online class again this fall
1.0,W,the test are difficult the instructor discuss anything that will really prepare you for the test she talks constantly about irrelevant topics this is the first hd class ever had that was this difficult when it be the information is not hard but you have to read in order to do well do not expect to learn in class

5.0,M,best instructor i have ever had the privilege to sit in a classroom with i leave the country for the next three years and one of the things im doing my last two days in america is sitting in on his class take him if you can

5.0,W,dr williams is great i had no desire to take a film class but needed the fa credit it turned out to be a good class it was a summer class and it was a lot to cover but it was surprisingly easy dr williams was very friendly personable and helpful if you can take her i would highly recommend you do so
1.0,W,this is the most unorganized teacher i ever had english is my favorite subject i have never struggled with writing before until this class she knows her facts but has no idea how to teach she is not helpful and soooo hard to understand the whole class is way behind and we do not even go by the sylabuss she does not stay on track with anythin

3.5,M,this is a difficult subject but ruhi does a good job of explaining the material exams are tough but they are manageable discussions are graded he does have an accent but is definitely understandable i would recommend this professor
4.0,M,ruhi is very nice and helpful but has quite an accent he makes the exams easy enough this class was business statistics i took ap statistics in high school so it kinda helped with acing the class and the exams he posts all his notes online i only looked through the book online if i doubted anything on his slides i recommend him
3.0,M,the discussions are interesting for papers always attend his office hours take notes in class and read the rubric times over i went from to an and a comment on how much he liked my paper
4.5,M,he is definitely the best professor i have had in the english department he is very helpful witty and funny his class to me is fairly easy as long as you read the assignment and follow his models for how you answer things also super easy to get along with and if you tell him something is not right fix it take him if you can
5.0,M,if you enjoy movies in any regard this class is for you mr cuevas is fantastically well-rounded in the world of cinema and will enlighten even the biggest movie buff he assigned two papers with clear outlines and three exams that he reviews for beforehand attend lectures because much of the exam derives from what he discusses in class
5.0,M,i took his class and he is very clear and concise as to what he wants your essay to be constructed as he is very helpful and although his teaching can get extremely boring it is helpful when you sit down and write your essay my writing has improved by taking his class
5.0,M,hands down best professor do not isten to toerhs when they say he is a hard professor if you are there to learn and put the effort in you will succeed study study his answers are there i promise he will teach you what you need to know and he is fair he will not give you copies of the notes so go to class
3.0,M,omg this class is hard the professor reads literally each work from the lecture notes and adds some other details to the notes but overall he just reads from them the sample tests are really helpful in understanding how to translate the formulas into practice and after doing the first exam it gets easier very nice person but boring class
5.0,M,scripps is a great teacher some people new to coding might have trouble but very available to help if having issues as is the lab assistant and your classmates not too much textbook use flipped classroom style was extremely helpful taking him next semester for
3.5,W,mrs orella was a good teacher you had to be in class and understand the work being asked to do just like any other class her class hard at all you had to earn a good grade but this class did improve my writing
1.0,W,i see most other students were just as unhappy with this instructor as i was i ended up really sick and emailed this instructor that i needed her to work with me re assignments etc after absolutely no reply i dropped the class via web not sure if there system glitch the class didnt drop she gave me an f and i never even turned anything in
1.5,W,most frustrating educational experience ever she did not clearly demonstrate what she wanted from me as a student writer her written comments were hard to read and harder to understand worst of all she bristled when asked for clarification help and guidance
5.0,M,he is an awesome prof took him during ext spring semi and got an a he is super easy he goes over what will be on the exam and makes you prepared only thing i like were the videos because they were kind of boring but overall i recommend him i wish he taught more courses so i can take him again easy a
5.0,M,i took his class in weeks and got an a his class is easy and he is a really nice prof i would take his class again just for fun i had two tests and final are tricky essay is easy and fill in blanks are easy one of the easiest class i have taken at pcc only thing i like was the boring videos we watched in class take him
5.0,M,is a very knowlegable took his class during my first semester at pcc i was so scared because english is my second his tests are very straightforward and he will drop the lowest test do all movie reviews because it will help to boost up your professor at person
3.5,M,buy the book pcc tells you to buy at the bookstore because he has you buy a different text this class is really good for those who are interested in art history if you find art history interesting probably think the class is super boring lots of memorization of art periods artists media types etc
4.0,M,good professor but he will let you buy textbook that be sold back because it comes with access code his tests are medium if you study you will pass and get good grades as simple as that tests movie reviews extra credit movie review and final exams he drops the lowest one grade final exam is not included he is so-so
5.0,M,one of the finest teachers at pcc if you are at all interested in classical guitar i implore you to take his class
5.0,M,when i walked into the class i already had years of classical guitar lessons when i played for him he really beat me up over technique and i hated him for it but kept coming to class anyways it really payed off this guy is brutally honest but he genuinely cares about you take him no matter what level you are you will learn a lot
4.0,M,if u are taking his math class its easy he is a good guy keep using some bad jokes in his class a little harsh about test his homework is not too much he said he did not like or class maybe thats y some people didnt feel good about their class
4.5,M,very good teacher if you want to learn math then look no farther he was a steelers fan so we got alone but serious very good teacher teaches the bigger picture in math exams and quizzes can be tricky tho i would recommend him for any math class if you really want to learn the material
5.0,M,i think he was a great teacher he was helpful when you asked the thing i liked the most is that his lecture notes are straight forward what you see in the lecture notes is what you will see on the test i personally recommend him even though some would say otherwise he gives lots of examples and explains very well
3.5,M,pretty good teacher in the truest sense of the word not very nice when you ask questions however most of his meanness is said jokingly he is very clear in what he wants his tests are pretty hard
4.5,M,statistics i liked phil as a professor he went over examples in class that looked exactly like what he puts on the quizzes and tests so your notes are basically the only thing you need to use to study for this class he is very consistent on tests and quizzes which is why i would definitely recommend him
4.0,M,professor hugh very funny and smart man his class consists of papers only no tests and as long as you put your life experiences and emotions on paper correlating itto the material he will give you a good grade he is a very easy grader oh no phones in class
5.0,M,mixes up of materials and mediums used to express absolutely fabulous attentive to the needs of the is just right and he provides support that is necessary through out the asks in the middle of the lecture if everything makes sense and provides time professor at smith hands down
5.0,M,i really enjoyed my class tim was very helpfull and the guidlines were clear wish i could have him for my next english class
2.5,M,do not take no matter how hard you try or how good of a writer you are you stil will get a c he really sucks and is mean for absolutely no reason
3.0,M,he is not the easiest person he basically just want you to follow and learn from his guidelines the class discussions can be interesting if you want to make it he listens to his students if really lazy or sensitive and striving for an a or b i recommend
2.0,M,he is not sensitive to medical issues miss this class even if on your death bed you will loose all class participation a very tough grader he never gives to students highly unlikely so consider a b an a in his class
5.0,M,professor chaney was such a delightful professor his projects were considerably flexible and super honest when giving critique despite being an am his class was super enjoyable such a fun guy all around take him
4.0,M,he defiantly plays favorites he will love and defend his film major students and practically brush off other majors however worth it i took him at in the morning and he had so much energy you just have to take his comments with a grain of salt
4.0,M,chaney was awesome he really cared about his students and was very encouraging even of films that other teachers may not have supported so much he was also just a really cool guy and gave great projects
4.0,M,chaney is the best he restrict your ideas on projects and always offers great feedback his class was fun and enjoyable even though it was at he really knows how to engage the class and get everyone talking if you can get in definitely take him
5.0,M,i took this class online and passed with a b you do have to put in the work but the professor is the best just make sure you keep up with your weekly assignments and quizzes he provides study guides for both mid-term and final you need only to buy the code for the book
5.0,M,i need this class how much is the midterm and final worth does his study guides prepare for exams this will be my second attempt is he really helpful is there book homework or only web-assign work does he allow use of electronic help mathway and other calculators
5.0,M,awesome take him of homework but he is willing to help all the time
5.0,M,mr gutliph is a great professor that wants all of his students to succeed this is not an easy class by any means but doable there are two homework assignments a quiz every week but he gives you the entire semester to turn them in do them weekly fall behind he gives u a midterm final study guide with every question need
5.0,M,let me start by saying this is not an easy class you will have tons of homework to do each week that being said i think almost all algebra classes have the same work mr g is a good guy and wants people to pass if you do the homework and study his review you will be fine may not get an a but you will pass i would recommend
4.5,M,great professor math my subject but i did great in his class took him in the summer so i had to cram a lot into about weeks he provides a lot of resources for help and responds fast great math professor
5.0,M,the best math teacher hands down i took him for math and math and always had the mindset that i was going to fail cause so bad with math but he made everything different very helpful you would need to make a lot of time for his class but worth taking take him you regret it
4.0,M,very nice professor answers emails promptly however doesnt have chat hours which is really hard to deal with especially for a math course otherwise everything is with webassign not so bad i would recommend him
4.5,M,great teacher must be dedicated to getting assignments in on time he gives fair chances and is always willing to help definitely take his class

5.0,M,brilliant man absolutely one of the best eku has to offer take a class with him if you can you regret it
4.0,M,dr rahimzadeh is an awesome professor funny crystal clear with the material you will leave knowing that you waste your time or money do the homework and show up for class also acting projects are big in this class very fun note if you want to act take his class
1.0,M,worse professor i ever had he is not willing to help students out and is random in class when he attempted to teach he would use youtube videos of others teaching
2.5,M,dr online classes are always easy however he grade discussions in a timely manner sometimes it can be or weeks before you find out your grade and by that time you have completed several more discussion posts exams are easy and are graded automatically
5.0,M,dr masten knows a lot and teaches a great course some students he should throw out on their ear but he puts up with them for some reason
4.5,M,i took his inline class really fun guy and very helpful made the class challenging and interesting i have learn a lot i highly recommend him you will have to work a lot
5.0,M,there are tests free response to a rather vague set of questions almost all lecture so you must attend class if you want an a outlines lectures and many aids are on blackboard this is not a blow off class you must work hard if you want an a good instructor though very clear on what he wants and offers ec at end of semester
5.0,M,mr dineen is an absolutely wonderful instructor he really knows his stuff attendance is a must tests are difficult but if you study you will do good your grade will reflect the effort you put into learning the material he makes learning about politics fun and try to sway us left or right he made us make up our own minds
5.0,M,this was one of the best courses ever taken he puts so much effort into his lectures and assignments you really learn everything inside and out you must put in the effort and follow his requirements in the syllabus to do well waiting until the last day to do the assignments is not a good idea not an easy a but highly recommend
5.0,M,he is an absolute amazing teacher you must attend the class he is way better in class than online he truly has a passion for this course but know your stuff he has tests with essays if you do not know the information or slept through lecture you will fail the tests read the textbook i would recommend him any day he is hilarious too
5.0,M,the class feels like an level class at times due to his demanding nature however you earn every point you get and you get every point you earn attendance is mandatory tests composed of two essays apiece gives possible topics for next test well in advance must be able to think for yourself and be prepared for class tough but fair
2.0,M,his lectures make no sense but you never have to show up to class he only gives a midterm and final and as long as you get the review he gives out the class before youll do fine he uses the same exact questions on the midterm and final as the review with different numbers he leaves the room during the test and the class takes the test together
4.5,M,everyday is a class discussion super easy you have an easier class he takes attendance everyday but only has class on mon wed for the mwf class you turn in a two paragraph research paper instead of coming on friday so simple he reads off the answers for his tests so write down what he says easy a
3.5,M,so easy highly recommend mwf class but he does not have class fridays instead you have to write two paragraphs on a given topic and super nice and virtually no work involved with the class and he tells you word for word what will be on the test easiest class ever
1.0,M,quite possibly the worst class ever taken his tests do not cover the material presented in lecture he like athletes and is unconcerned with out of people failing
1.0,M,terrible professor expected students to know information for tests that he even teach about it awful grading system i will never take a class with this professor again and advise no one else to either
5.0,M,excellent professor really knows his topic and imparts his enthusiasm to his students highly recommended
2.5,W,she is a sweet lady but the most boring professor ever good intentions but i would avoid her class at all costs i fell asleep every class i have no idea what the class was even about i take her a shame because a nice person but not a very good teacher
4.0,W,very sweet lady her class is a little dry but the subjects you have to learn lots of group no tests just a lot of very passionate about the material and that kind of gets in the way of her teaching but she knows her stuff only teachers for this subject and the other was much harder
4.0,M,a capital markets class that only covers fixed income so the last unit is entirely esoteric derivatives material he is very smart and an excellent teacher but the material is simply too complex for an average finance student memorize the problem sets and pray on the multiple choice you need a textbook he gives you pdf readings
1.0,M,this was has been my worst class at alabama during the class lectures dr ligon read verbatim from the powerpoints these powerpoints were directly from the book making them hard to understand he speed reads through every slide to just get it finished in the lecture time he barely went over the math questions and expected you to learn them
4.0,W,her class was extremely difficult and dense but if you do the readings and engage with it then a really great teacher her intelligence is intimidating at times but she do it on purpose just actually that smart
5.0,M,andy katz is a great guy and the classes i took with him were some of the best experiences i had at denison very personable and gets you to really engage with material also quite available outside of class and suggest dropping in on office hours just to talk not even about class you regret taking a course with katz
1.0,M,stop please take any of this classes words to describe his classes boring pointless confusing long boring and annoying he is a nice enough man and even nicer when he is imposing his ideas and beliefs on you during ever class
4.0,M,absolutely amazing professor a wonderful person as well labs are very easy marks and his exams are extremely fair
4.0,M,dan is a really polarizing character if you participate in class and ask intelligent questions he is very willing to help you succeed his lecture style is really quite strange but i really enjoyed his classes
5.0,M,probably the nicest kindest professor out there simply a genuine guy extremely helpful and approachable for advice decisions or help in the course his lectures are great to attend they are all you need to succeed highly recommend him as a professor he really promotes discussions and debate great teacher and got me interested in philosophy
5.0,M,an awesome prof super clear had an exam with him yet but incredibly approachable and supportive encourages students to engage in thoughtful discussion and incredibly positive highly recommended
3.5,M,the only thing difficult with his classes is the volume of information needed to have an understanding of doug is eager to help any student though if confused at all ask for help
4.0,M,a new concept students should try studying in order to pass his class one must actually study he teaches the material and it is up to the student to try to understand it you actually have to use logic in his class not just learn definitions although he check the homework it is the difference between passing and failing
5.0,M,one of the best professors i have ever had if something was not understood he stops and makes sure that everyone understands before moving on he actually teaches instead of lectures
5.0,M,he is an amazing teacher siab for life
4.5,M,ernie obviously knows what talking about and is very arrogant at times however i find him very helpful and he is always willing to go over things again even though he looks at you like stupid not an awful class
4.5,M,i have to say ernie rice is helpful no doubt about it however he is authoritarian in class he confiscated an cell phone he is really crass unprofessional verbally abusive he will try his best to make you look stupid he is very full of himself his opinion is to be taken as gospel overall not a very likeable person
5.0,M,excellent professor had him for algebra ii trigonometry and calculus and excellent professor cares very much about your understanding grades fairly and is always available to help
5.0,M,he is a wonderful math professor i had him for the fall semester he knows his stuff and explains concepts really well he assigns homework for each section but it is not collected or graded theres a quiz once a week and its usually only problems i would definitely recommend him he also is very funny
3.5,M,he knows what he is talking about all his tests are free response so do not expect multiple choice depending on your class the curve is either really good or really bad he gives you everything you need to know for the test and drops major hints about questions if you did not do well its your fault not his he does his part to help you pass
1.5,M,awful instructor intensely focused on theory and over-complicating subject matter to feed his own ego zero interest in students arrogant and more interested in failing students class average for midterms was below showing he teach the material he expects students to know avoid at all costs
1.5,W,she is boring and not very clear she speaks very quietly so sit near the front of the class
5.0,W,outstanding prof you know exactly what to study for the exams one time she referenced pitbull and shakira and when i knew it was going to be a good semester
4.0,M,before i lament on the difficulty i did receive an a in his class the only way this is possible is if you study a great deal wait until the last minute hint his tests are harder than the final but make sure you do as well as you can on them if a nursing major this class is a joke compared to so his difficulty will help you
2.5,M,this professor is no joke ridiculously tough although a nice guys and tries to lighten up the mood in class his tests are extremely hard because on a powerpoint and you have a minute to answer better off reading the textbook than his slides gave a very small curve i studied hard and got a c nobody in that class got higher than a b
2.0,M,okay his class is beyond hard he has good intensions but is no help he feeds you such interesting things that will have nothing to do with anything on exams you will hate this class my tip is if you want to pass the class read the chapters you need atleast times and answer all of the review questions after the chapters your best bet
1.0,M,boring lectures not direct rambles unorganized time better used on reading textbook and studying material on tests always covered in guides hard to know something when not told about a different teacher a nice funny old guy but needs to methods of his lecturing cause they suck
4.0,M,be real here people who rate professors poorly were probably poor students to being with his classes are easily understood and do just fine if you take notes and participate in class like you should in any class a nice guy and will answer your questions if you need help and hands out a guide at the start of class
1.5,M,give the course packet to us at all so it was very difficult no powerpoints so you have to write everything down from what he speaks miss things tests are hard no homework
2.5,M,dr peters is very smart and interested in student learning structure of the class lecture the whole time and we got freedom to work at our own pace he has you do a ton of readings at the beginning of the semester though and gets pretty mad if you do them a good professor but pretty hard especially for a lower level class
2.0,W,please avoid this professor at all costs i took this class online and every week i had written pages of research work just to pass she takes off for idiotic things and help you what so ever please avoid taking this class with her online it is almost impossible to keep your sanity
5.0,M,professor bloom is the best so helpful and wonderful the most approachable professor ever had at smith i highly recommend his courses also a fairly generous grader and adorable
5.0,W,awesome professor really tries to get you to think the tests can be a bit tricky but if you show up listen to what she says skim the readings and do the assignments you should be golden the topic is interesting and she teaches it well highly recommended
1.0,W,she is one of the hardest graders ever she makes fun of the journalism degree constantly and says that going to make us work twice as hard when we come to her class her assignments are ridiculous and she makes it very difficult to have a good grade in the class without staying up all night to finish her assignments
1.0,W,her lectures are not interesting at all and the material on the exams is all based on the textbook readings which are easily multiple chapters and multiple articles per night she is useless when it comes to help and unforgiving about students specific situations the inclass assignments are like mini not take this class with her
4.5,W,very helpful and her class is interesting you have to read a lot but a research course so you kind of have to figure that fun teacher though
2.0,M,professor fogel is a very nice and smart man but he is extremely confusing as a lecturer we constantly skipped around in every book we read which made it very difficult to understand what was going on he is available for help but his explanations or answers to questions are often confusing grading is pretty fair
5.0,M,it had been a pleasure to be in this class frank has a world of knowledge he is intelligent and resourceful also if he does not have an answer to your research it and attend the next class with an eagerness to share the information he has found i would definitely suggest you take a class with this professor
5.0,W,i lover professor moore prior to enrolling in math i had no idea how to do a lot of things and my pre-cal class i took in hs made my confidence lower about my math skills very enthusiastic and not boring at all i learned sooo much and she gives out a lot of extra credit i definitely recommend her if you are not lazy
3.5,W,moore is a pretty decent teacher she helps and gives a lot of example during class if confused her test are a bit of a struggle and the homework and quizzes are all online she does five of a ton of extra credit but make sure you wait till the last minute all in all she too bad horrible at math and she helped me pass
1.5,W,shes a very friendly woman but she classifies herself as an auditory learner so most of her material is online and her lectures are mostly her speaking not a lot of examples no book no actual homework to turn it all online and on very vague notes would not recommend her at all if math an easy subject for you
1.5,W,although she is a very friendly person and tries her hardest she makes mistakes in every lecture which only confuses the students she wants her students to do well but it felt like we were learning the course with her and not being taught the course i do not recommend this professor
2.0,W,professor moore is a very friendly professor however her lectures are very unclear she makes a lot of mistakes during lecture and although she corrects herself it gets confusing her tests are extremely hard and there was a quiz everyday
5.0,W,by far the best professor dean and person at st johns never learned so much in a class she keeps it real with you and gives you whats expected in the real world for once in my life i would be upset when class was canceled please take her for or and easy a none the less
1.5,M,this was by far the hardest class i took for my first semester of college mr martin is a great guy as a person but he expects way too much his exams are all essays and he expects you to know every little detail if ok with getting a c or lower take his class if not run
1.0,M,if just trying to get units for your general ed this is not for you quizzes are given almost every class session and he is a very hard grader on essays give you essay questions to study before the exam pick four of the essay questions and then you only answer you you basically waste your time studying extra essay questions
1.0,M,do not take this class there is a reason he has over ratings this is my first time rating a teacher because i need to vent not a teacher you take pages of notes almost every class that he reads word for word off a slides show he is very slow gpa killer test are all essay question in which he grades very hard boring
2.0,M,do not take his class his lectures are to mixed and he goes to fast to take any notes his assistant was not my favorite to say in the nicest way the final is essays and descriptions of people or places i would advise that you pick another teacher i mean look at his ratings nice guy but not a good teacher
2.0,M,he was an ok professor you have to do the reading for the quizzes and you have to be a good writer for the exams but if you pay attention and do the reading it really all that hard i got a b he does like to hear himself talk though
4.0,M,dr martin is a great history professor if you do the work required and take responsibility for your own grade you will like him if you do those things you like him
3.5,W,as a person i like her a lot i also like her as a teacher i think she teaches very well personally however she is very unforgiving she accepts nothing late and is a very harsh grader be wary when you join her class if you good at getting things in on time but if you are she is a very good teacher and person
1.0,W,very unwilling to help and when she did answer a question it was never the correct answer she sets you up to fail
4.0,W,professor woody seemed very passionate about the subject and i had no doubts about her knowledge level she was enthusiastic and answered questions well during lecture she posted the slides online which was very helpful if you ever missed a class only thing i like was that lectures were very long and not much interaction with audience
4.5,W,woody is overall a great professor she always came well prepared her lectures were pretty interesting and she was eager to hear input she is definitely one of the few professors that really want her students to learn something and is very helpful i would highly recommend her
5.0,W,my favorite prof at uw well-prepared and enthusiastic for lectures and foster own thoughts a lot easy-going on hw deadlines and very helpful at office hours sets up online discussion boards and attend conversation frequently she would be perfect if it is easier to get a good grade on her courses
5.0,W,andrea woody is one of the best professors had super knowledgeable and teaches effectively even if intimidated by the sciences this class will give you interesting insights best of all she really cares about her students and philosophy of science go to office hours she is also a great mentor
4.0,M,a great professor clear and helpful and has endless comedic anecdotes i loved the class i wish i could take chinese with him all four years
4.0,W,a really easy teacher she make it harder than it has to be and she is very helpful when you ask for her help
5.0,W,dr vanderhoof was such a joy to take do not take anyone else but her for this class she assigns sort of a lot of homework from the book but so simple that not a big deal she is the sweetest lady who teaches like back in grade again
3.0,W,what a pointless class you learn absolutely nothing and she comes off as cold she is so picky when it comes to grading honestly it seems pointless to even go to this class i thought introduction to research would be more informative but this class is useless and thats it
5.0,M,a good professor some people just misunderstand his intention because he does get annoyed easily but he mean any harm also know who audience is every graduate student loves center but undergrad students who are bad at math like him
5.0,W,her class is awesome attend class do the work try your best and you will do fine akk her classes are easy once you put in a lot of effort
4.5,M,such a good professor i loved going to class because his reactions are hilarious class was very fun and he really does want everyone to pass just make sure to understand all the examples he gives in class and do well
4.0,M,i took gao for calculus i over summer he was very helpful and cared to explain my mistakes without asking him he seems to choose material purely out of care to prepare us for harder classes i had some trouble listening to his lecture but overall his communication was excellent i definitely recommend taking him for a semester
4.5,M,gao is a tough cookie he has an accent and tends to be very lazy when executing problems for the class but i enjoyed his class he assigns weekly homework weekly quizzes three midterms and one comprehensive twice of a midterm he will try to trick you on some of his quizzes but the midterms and final are chosen from hw questions
3.0,M,professor gao can be lazy at times but overall his class is somewhat easy he has a heavy accent so it is difficult to understand him at times a lenient grader there are four included and like quizzes overall if you can avoid him avoid him else you wont regret it
4.5,M,he is a really helpful professor he wants students to succeed he does have a strong accent but once you are in class and listening to him easy to ignore definitely one of the most caring and considerate professors at csulb
1.5,M,he doesnt seem to care about the students
3.0,W,nearly everything she does in class appears to be taken right from the textbook she teaches by simply doing example after example and really explain the concept by talking but rather does lots of examples in order for you to understand which bad if you study the tests and quizzes can be quite easy
2.5,W,i struggled at first with math but quickly learned what she wanted do the homework twice once a few days before the quiz and the night before trust me worth it the midterm final questions are kind of odd you get to use a sheet of notes on the midterms finals overall not a bad professor but not a great one
2.5,W,not even worth it to go to lecture she simply does the exercises and problems from the book and does extensive pointless proofs i found it easier to just read the textbook and teach myself pray for a good ta
2.5,M,nice guy but old school wastes time transferring lecture notes on the black-board when he could simply use the overhead one easy paper but petty points deducted for grammar etc very rigid with grading no extra credit offered if borderline a he will not give you credit so b it is most other would give you the a for participating
5.0,M,took this class in spring of usually i hate night classes and anything with a three hour lecture but he was good about making the class interesting and ended class if he finished early almost everything is gone over in lecture with just a few book readings to reinforce the topic there is one paper but no big deal
5.0,M,great professor straightforward class and easy to achieve an a complaint he uses a very dry textbook as a psy prof who no doubt took a course on learning should know better than almost anyone to use a book at least somewhat interesting
5.0,M,if you have the opportunity to take him do it his class is more than interesting and his tests are made to be passed take good notes read the book and you will get the a he explains everything prior to tests and final the pop are to make sure you are always studying great guy and great course
5.0,M,love this class and teacher is so nice puts everything into perspective he is very clear and very fair quizzes drops tests drops one paper and a final class is lecture based so showing up is important but he leaves it up to you would take another class with him any day favorite teacher at moorpark so far
5.0,M,love him so nice and helpful and after having classes all day he made this hour long class as fun as possible he was so nice to everyone and really cared about his students and making sure everyone understood very easy to get an a without much work i actually feel like i learned stuff in this class that remember take him
5.0,M,he is not only a wonderful professor but a great man his class is super fair and almost easy if you take good notes and attend class he is very friendly and loves to engage with the class he will do whatever he can to help would definitely recommend him take good notes get an a easily
2.0,M,avoid at all costs this guys grading system is the most messed up thing ive ever seen the first two tests are nothing compared to the final during class he went to europe for some reason and gave us lectures to learn on our own whenever you try to ask a question in class he ignores you unless you yell at him
5.0,M,time taking him easy a and if you want to learn then you will take him tons of extra credit and not a whole lot of work
5.0,M,gerald ludwig is my favorite accounting professor he is very nice and very fair with grades and he makes tests not too difficult he assigns extra credit and homework assignments that are hard not to get on i prefer his online class since a bit easier for me but he is an excellent teacher in-person as well take him for accounting
5.0,W,the best professor i have ever had recommend that anybody take a class with her if possible
2.5,W,this class was awful the book was so confusing and difficult to use she wrote the book the lectures were mildly interesting but seem to have any continuity i would not recommend this class
3.5,W,i took this class freshman year and it was super challenging but really interesting you have to work your ass off if you expect to have a good grade hard to pin down exactly how she wants you to answer questions in the essay but happy to work with you lovely woman
5.0,W,i took class freshman year which i recommend for everyone i absolutely bombed my first that i met with her every week before an exam and ended up getting an a in the three classes of that i turned out to be one of my favorite reviewing here must have given up without trying
2.5,W,she is extremely interesting and has some adventurous stories a tough grader and sometimes hard to understand the point trying to make or follow what saying in class interesting but i think all the work was worth it for a gen ed she has some interesting opinions on religion and she will attack your beliefs
4.5,M,probably the best professor at law friendly engaging and knows the material cold his evaluations are challenging but fair plus the dude is jacked highly recommended
4.0,M,he is such an awesome guy and really loves phil only hw is readings from the text and tests all essay style easy grader yet hard material def challenges your mind to a whole other level lectures are interesting so make sure you attend doesnt really have lecture notes so you must do the reading
5.0,M,dr critelli is an amazing professor he makes you think outside of the box and challenges you to be out of your comfort zone a reason he says things so think entertaining you take good notes and read the text to do well in the class make sure to go to his office hours he will help you out i wish he taught more classes
2.0,W,tests are extremely hard she knows her stuff
3.0,W,she is hard but a genius
2.5,W,do not take her class she gives ridiculous amounts of work and is a very hard grader she believe in giving good grades watch out
3.0,W,horrible teacher impossible tests big project no compassion for students big attitude problem do not take her
3.0,W,very hard teacher she expects everyone to know everything she help at all very mean and very rude tests are hardest take her i hate this teacher she teach that much but she gives a big project that mean a lot
4.5,M,i liked dr caspi for this class his classes could sometimes be boring and drag on but at the end you do learn a lot try not to take his humor to heart he has a tendency to make jokes students but all in good fun
3.0,M,really good guy who is interested in his subject very discussion-based so you need to read the book
4.5,M,best class ever taken i loved professor amrine he was always willing to help and give insight into the texts and he was brilliant in lecture this is the kind of class that was meant to be experienced while in college he makes you actually think not just memorize information
3.0,M,dr wilson is a great teacher who really cares about his students yes he does have a very unique and unorthodox teaching style he take attendance all tests are take-home yeah take-home and you can re-take tests as many times as like his tests are so confusing but go to his office hours and help you understand them
1.5,M,confusing this is the one word that i can use to describe this professor ruckh talks too much about things that make sense most of what he says is irrelevant and i find it hard to come to class everyday he seem to appreciate your opinions if you agree with him ruckh is smart but teaches in a confusing way
1.5,M,overall he was very keen about what he was teaching he make it easy for us to feel the same way and at times he was slightly off-putting in regards to subject matter there was never a clear focus and it always seemed like the weirder the better was the way to go
3.5,M,dr ruckh is a great teacheer and knows what he is talking about however the way he presents history as a flow of evergy can get very confusing as long as you keep up with the readings it is an enjoyable class and you can learn some valueable stuff
5.0,M,this class was one of my favorites and dr hupp has been one of my favorite professors as long as you attend class take good notes and study for the tests you will get an a should definitely take dr hupp he is a fantastic professor and is really funny
4.5,W,lady sparky is a remarkable her lectures were incredibly lively and informative tabby is a brilliant academic whose body of knowledge is quite impressive be sure to participate and arrive on time this is the minium respect you can pay to a lovely lady who has the stunning beauty of lady audley and the sharp wit of sherlock holmes
2.0,W,she is very unorganized she also tends to make inappropriate comments about the art discussed she does assign weekly readings and papers
1.0,M,this guy is useless and arrogant he converted a regular class into a blended one and kept assigning research papers for students to read while he himself sits at home he is never in his office most hilarious is that if you ask him something he know he will tell you a long story about the work he did at morgan stanley yrs ago
3.0,M,took for plc do not recommend lectures are meaningless tests are brutally specific projects are simple but very poorly explained both because instructions are unclear and because he teach the material required prepare to spend a lot of time in his office or exchanging emails which he can take a day to respond back to
1.0,M,horrible teacher not helpful and completely rude but i believe he has reasons behind his methods giving loads of busy work i learned how to work diligently and get things done on time i still hate him though
1.0,M,the worst teacher on this campus all of his assignments are unnecessary and do not relate to anything we talk about during class he likes to hear himself talk and he loves moodle but moodle is awful he is an awful teacher avoid him at all costs you will not learn anything he speak very good english and has a thick accent hate class
1.5,M,he is not as bad as they make it seem he has a very thick accent and sometimes it is hard to understand he gives about ten homework assignments before class but he never gives quizzes or tests homework is easy and it all takes about an hour to do small presentations and one final big group presentation i would recommend this class
1.5,M,zeno is a very redundant teacher avoid if at all possible he gives a ton of pointless work that is hard to keep up with and really teach anything related to philosophy total waste of my time
1.5,M,had him for critical thinking and he is the least understanding individual on the planet he fails utterly at the critical thinking aspect of his course if you agreeing with him he like you also a ridiculous amount of online work stay away
4.5,M,great teacher with interesting experience and a delightful sense of humor learn a lot in his classes
5.0,M,probably the greatest teacher i have ever had taking his class actually changed my outlook on religion and life you must go to class and listen he is an amazing lecturer and is extremely knowledgable he makes all his philosophical points easy to understand often using his cats as examples haha or ice cream highly recommended amazing prof
5.0,M,greatest funniest more intelligent teacher ever had incredible very philosophical but used incredible analogies to help the class understand what he was talking about absolutely hilarious in lecture extremely knowledgeable about his field i have profound respect for mark unno and look forward to taking more of his classes in the future
2.5,M,although he was a nice man and very intelligent the way he conveyed the material was very unorganized i studied so hard for this exam and felt completely dumbfounded on the exam he gives true or false questions on the exam that are extremely tricky and in no way indicative of how good of a law student you are he needs to change his methods
1.0,M,horrible textbook that he is writing and emails the sections out as he writes them he is a horrible teacher hard to follow all over the place and not clear take this guy if you have the choice
3.0,W,chase taught me absolutely nothing in her class everything i learned was mostly through past though find past exams cause her test will most definitely be the same exact thing just different s the appendix hw are ridiculous and impossible but they will help you on your final if you are studious with it final was a killer
5.0,M,he is just an all around great person very funny and easy to understand
5.0,M,great class great professor i recommend that if you go to class get lecture recordings his exams are pretty much from his power point slides but he says a lot of stuff that on the slide and he will test you on so just looking up the slides on bb wont help that much
5.0,M,dr barden is one of the nicest people you will ever meet and his sense of humor is hilarious all of the exams are based on the powerpoint slides from lectures and he provides study guides and practice exams just attending the lectures will probably earn you a high grade and the lectures are for the most part interesting
3.5,M,as much as i love professor kelley i dislike his teaching methods if you really want to understand orgo read ahead cause in class he assumes you already have and just starts speaking another language entirely to you memorize everything he writes and i think be fine cause thats what he puts in his paragraphs on the exams
1.0,M,printing out his lecture slides will get you no where live eat and breath the textbook try looking up orgo guides books outside of class they can explain things more simply than kelly and the textbook be careful there is no lab to help your grade in like in good luck
2.5,M,dr kelley definitely knows a thing or two about chemistry and that enthusiasm shows what he is not great at though is teaching concepts where the textbook comes in and reading the textbook is necessary to do well in this course listen to him when he says to make flashcards they will actually help
4.0,M,his class though i found it challenging is easier than other schools the key to his class is not to just blindly copy whatever he writes but to pay attention to what he says and take notes on those things while maybe not the most clear instructor one of the nicest people and even once photographed his class for his grandchildren
1.0,M,makes almost no sense does not even come up for a breathe to allow you to ask questions unfortunately there is no avoiding him
2.5,W,very hard marker and will fail you for no real reason you can spend nights doing a project and she give a jack
1.0,W,she made it difficult to ask questions she made me feel like i was an idiot by not understanding she seems veryyyyyy intimidating
2.0,W,sarah is the sweetest person ever she truly cares about her students and wants to see them succeed some of the readings were interesting and some of them i care too much for most of the assignments were interesting but they were really unclear use your plas they will be a resource she expects consistent participation as well
1.0,W,sarah is an enthusiastic teacher but is incapable of presenting anything clearly many class periods she will forget to go through her powerpoint presentation that contains important course material expect lots of discussion but nothing of any significance
4.5,M,he made this class as painless as possible always helping you with your research pretty funny so the class was enjoyable so if looking for a professor that a pain go for it
1.0,M,i walked out of this class not learning a thing he gives pop quizzes so you have to read the books which are so boring funny i actually enjoyed the class all we did was watch youtube videos the little work you do have he is such a hard grader and very unclear on the actual assignment all of us were always confused on what he wanted
5.0,M,dr k is a pretty funny guy and very reasonable on assignments and grading he really likes his upper division students and even brought us pizza easy b but an a will require just a little effort
4.0,M,smart guy lectures have a tendency to become dull and boring because of his speed of speech though i was very interested in the subject matter i found myself on occasion having a hard time staying awake
4.5,M,i really enjoyed having him for class he is a really nice guy and is very helpful when asking him questions i enjoyed the class a lot despite the monotonous voice that sometimes made me want to go to class but since a lot of things mentioned in class was new i tried to stay awake
4.0,M,he is extremely nice and very passionate about the subject but is all over the place it is hard to know what to study when test time comes around
3.5,M,he gave clear instructions but his grading criteria was not as concise good marks for actual classroom instruction poor marks for time management and grading
3.5,W,linda has a caustic sense of humor sensitive folks tend to dislike her she speaks about highly academic subjects in irreverent ways but really knows her literature if you get over the initial slight and press her she shows extreme interest in your success and learning what more can you ask for
5.0,M,this is the first time i even write about a professor but i had to write about him i took his class in the and he is one professor who i still fondly remember he truly is there to help you get through your courses and give you a and along the way i truly do wish there were more just like professor all my best to you
5.0,M,i am not sure why some people did not like him he is a fantastic teacher who knows alot about traditional japanese culture he is strict but very nice and helpful got an a and i am happy with that
5.0,M,absolutely phenomenal professor he is extremely passionate about what he teaches and is dedicated to helping you receive the best mark possible that being said do not expect a bird course by any means quizzes are frequent and rigorous and you can expect to be diving into kanji by the end of your first semester
1.0,M,not quite sure how what he does is considered teaching more like unencouraging terrible
1.0,M,worst teacher i have ever experienced he rarely gets off his high horse to actually help students learn his views which are a must and if you prefer thinking outside the box good luck because he allow it there were several email threads over the semester with complaints about his attitude and teaching style avoid at all costs
1.0,M,i wish i had know about his online course before taking it the worst experience ever
3.0,W,actually a decent teacher her powerpoint presentations were very helpful i barely read at all the book is which is ridiculous and she is the only teacher for that uses that book her final test is bs and she curve at all so beware
2.0,M,he is a subjective marker likes you higher grade
1.0,W,very confusing weekly instructions reprinted from past courses with incorrect dates and misspellings poor instructor she does not seem to comprehend higher level literature
4.5,M,the absolute best professor i have ever had i think it is possible for a professor to care more about his students he is tough but also unbelievably helpful he is a breath of fresh air in the stuffy law school atmosphere funny and very wrote the civ pro book
4.5,W,i suggest reading the material ahead of time from the text if you have it they have it in the library which i used because textbooks are do the extra credit always that means come to class or else you will miss out day pick on people to participate let this scare you away she stops after around the week
1.0,W,she is very unorganized her lectures and power points had nothing to do with her tests she rarely covered what was going to be on the test her in class assignments felt like they were meant just to take up time do not recommend taking her class she makes an easy class hard with her teaching
2.5,W,not the most interesting the usuall run over notes and one or two in class is based on what she talks about this class is missing something to catch student attention
5.0,W,really understanding and fair professor she does the job perfectly she allows chances and make up works she gives out extra credits for you to show your efforts to recover your mistakes she is good at what teaching
5.0,W,prof adams has the students best in mind when she teaches this class she gives you ample chances to get your work done and is very fair i would highly recommend you take her class

5.0,W,brenda adams is a great teacher she is very helpful and understanding always willing to help everyone
4.0,M,really nice guy class can be a little boring at times but it is mostly because of the material that we have to cover he does a pretty good job of using different teaching methods
3.5,M,i loved brother zenger he was so nice and willing to help and made class interesting just do the homework and come to class and study for the tests which were difficult but as long as you study its pretty easy loved the study guides and reviews in class
5.0,M,excellent and passionate professor he is extremely willing to help you out in class he really inspires you to think and learn in his class
4.5,M,difficult for me to rate him accurately because i already knew everything covered in cs so i found the class pretty boring prof cohen was still pretty interesting though because he tends to go off on tangents although that might have a negative impact on someone who know the material from which he is digressing
4.0,M,great teacher knows his stuff and knows how to teach people who complain are the ones who did not try and were playing games on their laptops in class
1.5,M,not a very understanding prof seems very nice and very approachable but in reality he is totally the opposite take cs instead cs
1.0,M,unfortunately the class does not use a book and is introductory so basically your as lost as you can be he thinks he covers topics but please you love your gpa do not try it
1.0,W,horrible she talks as if unsure of what about to say she tells you trust will lead you there she takes a very long time to get to her point her labs do not relate to what learning from the textbook class mandatory but she will yell at you and say a bad role model if you go avoid her
4.5,W,very in class but super helpful and a lot nicer in office hours if she makes you feel stupid get over it just her style
5.0,M,super helpful and very clear in his lecture and in his email very nice proff and i would totally take another course with him again if i could
5.0,M,really good proof and very clear in his lecture assignments and exams are fair very nice and helpful
5.0,M,amazingly intelligent he lectures from memory and knows something about pretty much everything his course was truly fascinating only problem is that he made his exams years ago and change them to what he actually taught this year but in the end hes an easy grader and weighs the percents of each piece of your grade in your favor
5.0,M,i took him for fall class is a talented professor with unique teaching style starting from our class he started providing audio powerpoint presentations which turned out to be very helpful tests are very challenging so pay attention to everything he says grade consists of a midterm final or group project and five quizzes
4.0,M,i took this professor for a maymester and he was incredibly nice and made what could be a boring class interesting he is very discussion based so you have to be willing to participate grades easily on group project but tests can definitely be tricky and difficult if you prepare he really tries to help you understand the material though
5.0,M,very good professor with an interesting teaching style tests are not that hard if you understand the material and pay attention to everything he says in class he will always answer any questions by making you answer it so be ready grade consists of a midterm final three quizzes and an optional group project take him if you enjoy finance
5.0,M,if you want to learn take tompkins he covers more material and in greater detail than other professors he is challenging the projects are time consuming but are graded easily the quizzes are hard but are representative of the test do well on the mid-term and set
4.0,M,talks very quietly and drones but what saying is easy to understand which is good for me since i suck at econ very patient and explains what he wants out of you so not hard to get good grades very nice to students so long as you are nice back
4.0,W,a good teacher and she seems to know her stuff she does get side tracked quite a bit but she seems very passionate about her work and the students in general i only had her as a lab instructor but really awesome and she made it a point to teach everything she could in a timely manner willing to help out at any point just ask her
4.5,W,love love love her she provides guided notes which make things a lot easier to follow and understand since there is so much material great sense of humor very compassionate and understanding with her students
4.5,W,i had dr brown for bio and she rocks i took the class on a sunday and she made it fun and enjoyable she is always willing to answer questions and really challenges you i found her to be very fair and supportive of overall goal of being successful
4.0,W,julie was great class was easy and she kept it interesting text was a waste of money though because she explains everything
4.5,M,he is the best professor in entire uhcl i have seen most of the professors in uhcl but none like him character wise and as a teacher very soft person dosent get angry at all he knows the subject very well and has great knowledge in it most on them take advantage of his lineance and dont listen to class hes a great personality
2.5,M,made people almost cry in class because of how he went about criticizing papers he just wanted students to write papers he thought was correct rather than write from their own opinions he needs to learn how to criticize constructively instead of blasting people for trying their best good intentions but really bad
5.0,M,really smart guy done this for a long time and it shows all of his lectures are very clear and he explains everything perfectly he gets really excited when we answer his questions and ask really intriguing questions awesome guy really helpful outside of class helps you find new ways to study efficiently sweet man who cares if you care
5.0,M,best first year biology teacher really knows his stuff and knows the perfect way to explain everything so that you understand it very good at pacing himself also very helpful if you show concern
4.5,M,his class was a lot of work a reading and a writing assignment for every class the great part is the class is over before you know it he is a fair but not easy grader a very compassionate person and it will help your grade if you agree with those sentiments
4.5,M,clear lectures and notes if you cover the review sheets that he gives you you will do fine very helpful and great explainer would take him again
5.0,M,took him for genetics he was a fantastic teacher taken the class with other teachers and thought that genetics was harder with lissemore i actually got an a recommend him all the way if you have the choice take him you regret it prefer him over other bio teachers in the department too
3.5,M,it was a very rough class one thing to know about this guy is that he grades harshly exams were difficult he expects you to memorize word for word definitions from the chapter and reproduce it on the exam he also had reading assignments for in-class discussions regarding bioethics which were pointless and time consuming
4.0,M,he is an amazing teacher and so understanding not an art major know anything about art or how to draw he helped me so much i ended up getting an a because he saw how hard i tried although my work as good as the others i enjoyed his class you need to be very neat picky be prepared to spend a lot of money on materials
3.0,W,dr brown is quite an interesting individual and her class was quite disorganized with the formatting clarifications and changing of rooms fortunately dr humor and execution made up for it and she is one of the sweetest instructors on the occ campus i took her postmodernism since a class of mine got cancelled but i hold no regrets
3.5,M,this class has very little lecture but when he does lecture pay attention those concepts usually end up on an exam you work out of a book in groups every class midterm exams written by him final is a national exam mastering chemistry hw each week would have gotten a better grade had i put more time into it
1.0,M,avoid is arrogant acs test scores are national we do terrible on it here at uvu take chem both semesters at byu or the u in the summer not with him not with him not with him
2.5,M,my worst experience in this university so far absolutely confusing you go take the test equally prepared every time and one time you get an a another a c then a then c random infuriating experience i get in high math classes and came out discouraged from his class avoid at any cost
1.0,M,one of the most unhelpful teachers when it comes to teaching if you like teaching yourself than this is the teacher for you it very helpful when you and your group have no idea what he is even teaching on i would say never take it from him
1.0,M,he thinks he teaches pogil but the g in pogil method stand for guided which he do he is lazy if you go to his office or stay after class to ask him to work out a difficult problem he ever do it if you ask for a way to see the steps he give it when people say he is fair due to his ridiculously huge curve
1.5,W,would not recommend this teacher she clear on what she wants in assignments then has the nerve to be offended at students confusion does not cover class readings in lectures awful temper and seems to expect the worst out of her students i quote from her syllabus students usually do not research the proper way to document internet
5.0,W,forget what the other bad reviews told you i just took her fall and she is really chill and funny if you take this class you will pass as long as you skip a lot of classes
5.0,W,professor pam is the best super chill and easy class really nice there are no midterms or finals we did three essays and all the other work was just complete or incomplete i definitely recommend this class for everyone she lets us out early half the time seriously best class ever
5.0,W,this class is ridiculously easy she goes over the readings in class so you really have to read all hw quiz dates and essays are listed on the syllabus she take attendance but showing up to class is the easiest way to pass the tests are easy too she allows you to make them up weeks after the initial date everything is easy
3.5,W,very understanding and wants her class to pass she explains what is being read and discusses the chapters for a better understanding
4.5,W,professor pam was super sweet and always really entertaining she kept us interested and was really relatable her papers were not difficult as long as you did some of the required readings plus she brought our class dozen doughnuts on our last day of class no finals in this class i would take another class with her for sure
4.5,W,she is a wonderful person and i love her super sweet and willing to help you in any way the class was fairly easy my only problem with her is that she is easily distracted and loves to ramble on she will spend half of the class talking about something completely unrelated to what we are supposed to be learning
1.5,W,this teacher definitely chooses her favorites but seems to pick on those who stand out in either good or bad ways she enjoys being the one who knows more so challenge her just keep your head down and your mouth closed and do fine
5.0,M,if you plan on going further into chemistry definitely take tjandra best chem teacher ever class is easy because he is determined to help you understand however even intro to chem gets a little complicated so listen to the man and do your work
5.0,M,wonderful wonderful wonderful i never took chemistry before and was rather afraid because i was unfamiliar with it he made it so fun and understandable and was always there to help he also offers a great amount of extra credit but he give you challenge also and makes sure you know the subject love this professor
5.0,W,best professor ever she really cares about her students and art
4.5,M,he is a solid grounded and very practical prof he simplifies the content and is quite fair one does need to put some work into this course
3.0,M,some of the material he teaches is outdated this was a race and ethnicity class so i was hoping to learn a lot about various ethnic groups however we spent a lot of time learning of his study on french and english relations instead mid-term was easy but the course overall was unevenly distributed with too much weight on one paper
4.5,M,i think prof mccauley is an awesome teacher he is easy to understand and he makes sociology interesting i plan to take more courses with him in the futue
2.0,M,this prof seems disengaged and bored when he lectures he can also be quite blunt and intimidating short tests paper and i would not recommend this course to anyone unless they are knowledgeable on religions
1.0,M,disorganized his lecture slides are all over the place but very understanding in terms of deadlines
5.0,M,what a great class dr fisher is a wonderful teacher and probably one of the most interesting and clear biology teachers had at saint louis if you have the chance to take him make sure you do four tests total and online assignments which are optional the tests can be tricky so make sure that you study the material well
5.0,M,he was great he does expect a lot you have to read and take a lot of notes but he does keep it interesting
2.0,W,never take her class gets off topic always never teaches only reads from the the time by telling fun out of people who disagree with her opinions please dont take her class
2.5,M,i had him for hist and actually kinda enjoyed his dry humor it is a lot of writing however and he definitely has high standards as far as the work load goes but you know expected of you and he gives you the exam questions ahead of time just try to summarize the answers in your textbook in your own words and be fine
2.0,M,i thought he was a good teacher not the most friendly though although he is willing to give you many opportunities with late work despite how intimidating he is in the beginning his exams are all essays and the grading is not easy on them make sure you do the quizzes journals and discussions to make up for the midterm grades make an effort
5.0,W,great instructor clear with directions answers emails quickly grades quickly as well she gives feedback on the graded papers in the side notes which were very helpful the papers assigned were interesting a great instructor i would definitely take again do the work read the assigned readings to help w writing get an
2.0,W,i would not recommend professor lape to people looking to take an online english course not sure how she is in a classroom but online she was confusing unorganized late giving back graded assignments and she did not respond to emails better off to just take her in an actual classroom or not at all
5.0,W,dr lape is absolutely the best instructor i have ever had i have had the pleasure of having her for a total of three classes she is upbeat and always gives her students positive feedback i took english on-line a lot of reading and writing but well worth it she prepares you for the professional world
5.0,M,awesome dude yes he will drop the i really like what the author did here joke times no it does not get old
5.0,M,very good teacher he teaches everything very clearly and step by step to make sure you understand it
5.0,W,the personality class was great not hard if you do the work the study guides make it so you know expected for the test clear about what she wants the presentations you have a lot of freedom on which i liked as with the final paper not vague you just have a lot of options very helpful lends books and is nice
5.0,W,she is the sweetest woman who really understands her students and gets that not everyone is interested in sociology but has to take it to graduate easy going and she will work with you as long as you communicate with her she knows her stuff and she explains it well she has her own ideas but genuinely hears her students out take her
5.0,W,great professor i took the class online and she was very clear on all assignments she was quick to respond to e-mails and provided feedback on assignments easy a if you do the work

5.0,M,great prof he knows his stuff very an easy a though but you will learn a lot he makes you to think out of the box i will recommend him he is a marxist very fair prof
3.0,M,i promise be thankful for his strict teaching method actually necessary for him to teach in such a way it helps you understand the language at the most vital stage so thankful he instilled fear in me to make sure my work was done and vocab was memorized people who appreciate it deserve to learn russian
2.0,M,gerry is a seriously rude individual and he expects you to know how to understand fluent russian from day he speak english in class the pace of the class is also fast and demanding for an elementary language course
5.0,M,best professor ever had soo encouraging humerous and genuinely sweet highly recommended for any and all courses he teaches master of many forms of martial art
5.0,M,anyone who complains about briggs is an idiot yes there are papers and tests its a college course moron not a tiger schulmans of course you have to do some work besides just tai he makes the tests and the papers as laid back and easy as he possibly can you could have written about anything and he would have accepted it great guy
4.5,W,is a brilliant teacher she knows what she is speaking about she understands that we all are college students and tries to help us in anyway possible pay attention and take notes or you will not pass
5.0,W,shes an awesome teacher her work is difficult but she knows what she is talking about if you listen and do the will learn a lot
1.0,W,she provide adequate information for any assignments learning material or reviews she spends hours talking about pointless information on material that students have already learned or we have absolutely no idea what talking about terrible prof good nurse but terrible prof
1.0,W,feels like she know what talking about her discussions are extensive for absolutely no reason and confuses people
3.5,M,bill ryan has got to be one of the coolest teachers at the uo if in his level class in for a lot of yelling guest lectures and emails with links to google image searches for cats in smaller classes a ton of work that may or may not be turned in and more links to cats but the man is a genius enjoy
4.0,M,easily one of my favorite professors at the uo although he does not lead the class every time the guest speakers that he brings in are amazing the grade is based on quizzes taken almost every day of class but if you pay attention you will get on every one this was one of the easiest classes i have taken so far i totally recommend him
4.5,M,dr gruenert is a deep thinker and really wants to hear all students thoughts and opinions during class although he may appear to be intimidating at first he really just wants class participation i learned so much in this discussion-based class and would encourage anyone to take his classes
5.0,M,very very cool teacher i took with him he is extremely helpful and super fun the atmosphere in class is great attending every class and doing all the homeworks and be good he teached me how to write essays properly now i am taking and getting a but i get c on his class i advice him if you want to learn how to write essays

5.0,M,prof stecker is really chill and he definitely takes time to explain anything relevant to the discussion that you understand
5.0,M,he lectures were entertaining and eye opening there is a fair amount of homework in the class and must read the textbook if you want to do well in class that was my problem i just listened and took notes on powerpoints but read text book like students who recieved a better grade than me
5.0,M,great instructor states clear objective every class very organized and enjoys what he is doing if you show up you will pass easy course
5.0,M,i cannot say enough about what a wonderful teacher dr t is incredibly nice very helpful he makes what been a very dry subject a fascinating one i always looked forward to his class will jump at the chance to have him as a teacher again the class is not hard there really that much work to do fun class fun teacher
5.0,M,seriously one of the best teachers i have ever had not only does he know communication he practices all of the lessons in his lectures i will be watching for other classes he instructs in the future to register for those be prepared though there is lots of homework but its worth it
2.0,W,exact same structure as cases paper and presentation class is not hard listen in class and take notes in packet pop an addy and memorize her study guide and at least get a b pretty easy grader on paper cases waste of time buy book just snap a pic of the cases
2.5,W,she is not a bad teacher but she does things that really annoy the is that teacher who wants to keep you until the last second of class and loves to hear herself talk she takes about a month to grade wants to give out all these assignments and try to grade tough but even grade them within a decent amount of time
5.0,M,one of the more enlightened experiences had in the classroom my writing improved to the point where i did extremely well on my gmat and i attribute that to dr terry and my social sciences instructors i want to emphasize that writing matters in all subjects and terry explains clearly regarding his standards and how to meet them
5.0,M,yager is the absolute best professor had on campus super helpful and you will learn a lot overall his class is easy but his exams are brutal study hard
5.0,M,amazing a blast of a class take everything with him
2.5,M,i felt really awkward asking him any questions because hard to understand you get really easy points for quizzes and labs but the exams are only questions so you really need to know the material tough to get an a but he helps as much as he can
4.5,W,i love professor sipple i have taken classes with her and would take as many others as i could she is very fun and engaging and she is super easy to talk to she is willing to help you raise your grade and as long as you do your response papers and participate a little she is very easy
3.0,M,mr douglass knows his material and could make it very is no room for note-taking class if you like to write this is the class for you all essay and memorization good luck
1.0,M,professor douglass is the worst professor i have ever had do not take his class attendance is mandatory you get three skips then he says you fail the class hard to understand use blackboard or power points never smiles need i say more find another professor so you actually have hope of passing history and not having to retake it
1.0,M,what ever you do do not take this class prof douglass is so unbelievably rude does not care about his students and acts like it is such an inconvenience if you ask him a question does not respond to emails and make black board available boring lectures quizzes plus midterm and final read the book if you want a chance in passing
1.0,M,one of the worst professors i have ever had he even make blackboard avaiable so nothing is on there he respond to his emails he calculate the grades until the end of the semester oh and his class contains only book quizzes that is it no other assignments or points he just needs to retire because clear lazy
2.5,M,douglas is a very monotone person lectures were boring and he never seemed like we wanted to be there you read history novels as well as the textbook give a sheet that provides the exact questions on the test the was probably the best part about him dreaded going to his class
1.0,M,very difficult to understand what he is saying but he gives you s review sheet for each and if you follow that pass i even listen to what he lectures becuase more than half will never be on a test
2.0,M,dr e is a super nice guy but i think he should be teaching lower level chem he just assumes that we already know what talking about so he explain anything tests are all short answer which is actually beneficial because you can somewhat bs
2.0,M,chem was a little tough his notes are sporadic and random he goes out of the book so depend on your notes he very clear about most things but he does love what he does the tests ask a lot of random minor things you barely cover so know everything he has a major grading curve so that is nice but the tests are pretty tricky
5.0,M,one of the best profs i have had at yorku he made it a goal to connect with every student and help them he is just so knowledgeable and enthusiastic he makes you want to learn more the material was quite difficult and at times he went through it quickly but he made you study it through his pop quizzes yorku is very lucky to have him
4.5,M,dr terry is thorough and thought provoking you cover a good deal of ground in corporate finance in adv fin mgmt while the earlier courses are a little too easy this course is really excellent this course makes heavy use of case studies an excellent immersive tool best time to ask him questions is during or after class
3.0,W,going into this class i thought it was a blow off class that i just needed for my major the first day she tells you that she is notorious for giving too many ha it that hard of a class but you have to go and have to actually study she told me i would get an a and that the case when i got my final grades bitter
5.0,W,great teacher very relaxed everything on the tests comes from the notes and she usually tells you what will actually be on the test
4.5,W,great lecturer clearly enthusiastic about film and her passion rubs off on students very clear very helpful all in all awesome prof
2.0,W,she does her lecture by reading off her notes with redundant vocabulary two assignments are not only time consuming but also being graded hard as hell pretend to be nice and mark very mean
2.0,W,while doing lectures the material got lost in her unnecessary vocabulary that just made her sound pretentious the course tie in historical context or significance of our time which can make it seem like an overall useless topic i love movies but this course really turned me off to any future endeavours in cinema studies
2.0,W,she was not very helpful she was a hard marker but could not explain concepts well relied too much on the textbook
3.0,W,prof wagman is a very nice lady but sometimes you know what to expect as long as you study the textbook content and attend class regularly be fine she specify which areas to study but fair as everything covered in class is test material the best part is that she will get you speaking spanish
4.5,M,very interesting and enjoyable class and teacher he does everything he can to be helpful but you have to attend and study every week highly recommended for serious students
5.0,M,if you fail this class you have no one to blame but yourself there is a ton of memorization astronomy what did you expect but everything that is on the test is in the textbook and mentioned in class his stories and corny jokes make it easier to stay awake since a night class too
2.5,M,we had to study a lot in this class take the class if looking for an easy a because you will fail his tests are mostly which i find harder than multiple choice questions his teaching style is quite hard to follow but you can tell he really has a passion for the subject our text is extremely helpful so use it
2.5,M,i really wanted to like his class but i like charlesworth better as a person than as a just rambles on and makes sense in class but if you read his book at home it gets hate this class and not hard at all very easy going and wants to be just cannot pay attention to anymore of his boring repetition
4.0,M,charlesworth is hilarious he loves astronomy and is very clear in his lectures he wrote his own textbook and all the material you need is in it aside from two star quizzes the rest of the material is pretty dense it is not an easy class a lot of studying is necessary but charlesworth makes the class entertaining
4.0,W,i had dr tenger for english which focused on mental illness with three short texts and four papers none over words i found her class to be rather easy but she liked my writing style she is known for grading harshly but as long as you write basic organized essays that explain the topic well she will be generous with grading
4.0,W,awesome liked her she is nice
3.5,W,she is a great teacher class is hard if you put the work into it she is very fair she drops lowest grade and scales all tests must be prepared for class to earn points which account for of grade do the work and you will be fine
5.0,W,love kathy she is so fun to have as a professor also pays attention to each of her students which is great
5.0,M,truly an amazing professor potter has inspired me to minor in sociology just by taking his class attend class take notes and read the book doing all this will get you an a he gives the essay question weeks before an exam super helpful kind and he really cares about his students wish this man taught every subject in the world
5.0,W,best professor ever had learned so much in her class not an easy grade but what she teaches will get you in all other classes so much more than a speech class highly recommended
5.0,W,i expected to give some speeches pass the class and move on but ms manatu made this class into a true learning experience she wants you to participate and engage in the class which by was hard to do but def worth the effort she lays out everything you need to do in your speeches with detailed outlines loved this class
2.0,W,this was a grad course on how to teach psych to undergrads i learned so much about what not to do she was disorganized distracted very unclear she able to finish grading on time due to dealing with administrative issues so she decided it would be okay to give the entire class incompletes weeks later still no grades seriously
5.0,M,realize how famous he was until i came here lol on that note yes tough fair but intimidating will make you work for that grade prof sarna is as well you will not succeed if excessively i hated participating and he picked up on it so he would make me do it but all to make you better as a student
5.0,M,on the first day i was warned by other i find him to be brilliant thought-provoking funny and very engaging people in my classes love him i hate participating but he challenged me in a great way been taking his courses ever since please slam the door be conscious he is great period
1.0,M,obviously he knows the material however does not have a clue on how to teach it he is very confusing he does not go over enough examples in class he just likes to hear himself talk and recite his own notes which he has is all about stimulation and practice and he provides zero of any of that overall he is terrible at teaching
4.0,W,you have to study hard in order to pass her class attendance and class participation are mandatory homeworks every day
5.0,M,best teacher had so far very funny you just have to show up to class and do the essays he gives for homework there many based on readings he put on e-reserve and just your opinion about it you need a textbook for him super easy going and friendly he has some pretty interesting life stories also
4.5,M,ok if you take him for the level class not as easy as everyone says he requires a page paper short assignments final midterm presentation etc so if you do take his class be prepared to come with the mindset to do work senioritis is not allowed overall he explains well and if you do your work you will be fine
4.5,W,loved her larkin is an amazing professor shes very enthusiastic and believes in her students she will not let you give up and will push you until you succeed be prepared to give she doesnt like slacking but she will give you a break if you need it class is fun and you make great friends highly recommend her you wont regret it
4.0,W,i learned to swim in her class i had friends to keep me company she just told us what to do its fine bc i learned there was extra credit to make up each absence also helped to practice a
5.0,M,i had him several years ago but what he says still haunts me to this day as i pursue a career in film how bad to you want it
1.0,M,he can barely even speak english hes mad confusing and not helpful at all
3.5,M,you definitely need to be a self starter and very disciplined to be successful in his classes he is very passionate about his class and making sure his students are the most successful in whatever their future endeavors are unlike any other teacher you will experience here at dcc more about quality than quantity great sense of humor
4.0,M,camilo is probably the best teacher i will ever have in my college career yes he pushes you yes the work is hard but this industry is hard the work camilo made me prepared me for what the industry will expect me to do he is helpful easy to talk to and funny i will miss camilo when i go onto my next school take his classes
5.0,M,wonderful professor he expects you to work hard and he works even harder trying to you to see the value in that a harvard experience in a community college take his classes
3.0,M,a great teacher and some people realize why he says and does the thing he does until moved on from dcc take what he says and use it moved on from dcc and it took me to go away to another school to realize how much harder i worked he sets his students up for the future you get that anywhere else i swear
4.5,W,i am taking this class as a hybrid over the summer definately fast pace but mrs seagle is very accessable and helpful i was scared to death of stats but thanks to her making she is the that dont like her dont try i suspect she put in effort if you dont
5.0,W,before i took this course i was scared to death of math because it was a subject in which i had always performed poorly mrs seagle is helpful and kind and explains the subject matter in a way that is practical and accessible she expects students to show up and put in the work but then again if you do not never learn statistics
1.5,W,it was apparently her first time teaching mth and she do a very good job of it bad at explaining i highly suggest registering for a different professor for this class there are a lot of homework checks and it really matter if you did it right or not as long as you attempted not helpful for learning the material at all
1.5,W,ugh i like her she was confusing and her tests had stuff that she had only brushed over and never explained how to find only said that it existed she was a nice person but even asking her questions in office hours was confusing
4.5,W,professor dogru is a great professor she is foreign so she has a very slight accent and occasionally she will accidentally mess up some grammar while talking but she is extremely helpful and truly cares about her students
4.0,W,i really enjoyed having this professor you had to work to earn your grade but her exams and quizzes were reasonable if you studied and knew your material you had homework but not very much and take very long to do sometimes she is a bit hard to understand but will clarify if you just ask i would recommend this professor
4.5,W,she was one of my favorite professors even surprised our class with pizza she is so sweet caring and enthusiastic to teach she is very helpful when you ask questions the class extremely difficult but not easy her tests are a little tough but if you study and do all of the homework be fine
5.0,M,he is probably the best teacher at mdc the class is not easy you have to study but he will give you everything you need in order to pass the test he is really nice and funny i highly recommend taking him for oceanography great professor great class
5.0,M,he is by far my favorite teacher at mdc his class is not easy if you want an easy a do not take but if you want a fair teacher who really knows about the subject or if you love oceanography take this class he is a very nice person and is writing me a letter of recommendation got an a because i did all the work and studied
2.0,M,if very into learning oceanography take him he gives vocab quizzes and his test are from the handouts and stuff he writes on the board this class is not easy but if this is your major then i suggest to take him he give extra credits use the book for the vocab he will not inform you regularly about how your doing in the class
5.0,M,best professor to have fun but when it comes to doing work he takes it very serious the class is very easy made me change my study habits for the best plus he prints the notes for the class and hand them out which all the test come from
5.0,W,ms pennington now weems was very helpful and smart i have always struggled with math and i took her stats over the summer and got a she is really nice and tries to help you in as many ways as possible we didnt use the book but she used mathxl which greatly affects your grade i loved her class always hated and sucked at math until her
5.0,W,dr fressola is one of the best instructors at bergen she has high expectations for her students but makes it clear what is expected she is one of the few professors that truly lives up to her doctorate in education one of the only instructors that has the guts to review the exam in front of the entire class the exams are difficult but fair
5.0,W,dr fressola was absolutely you were in her class you walked a straight line at the same time i saw the passion she had for teaching and nursing as well today years after my nursing ceremony at bergen i thank her for being who she is and for believing in me thank fressola she was simply marvelous
4.0,W,the best teacher the program has to offer yes she was tough but the only professor who genuinely wants you to understand what it takes to be a nurse the rest could care less if you get it or not
5.0,W,a great teacher and hilarious i love her class
5.0,M,great teacher cares about students gives extra credit to boost grade review for every exam take him easy a he will not stress you
5.0,M,he is a great teacher his teaching style if very different and he makes his classes very interesting there is never a dull moment in the class i thought the class was very helpful too
3.5,W,i loved her she is a little out there but she repeats things sevral times with handouts that help when studying the workload too rough but there is a lot on test i had her for psyc the sensation class spends more times on eyes than anything but i recommend taking a class from her
4.0,W,very helpful and knowledgeable as she is a veteran of all topics related to but the overall course was not what i expected it was much harder than it appears my final grade was a b but i devoted a lot of my time to this class and put in what i thought was more work than was expected of me very challenging but you do learn
5.0,M,easy class he is the only sociology teacher with this easy of a class i loved it he is great you have to read the books but they are actual books not text books this class is so simple not even funny
5.0,W,hands down one of the best instructors come across in a long time she goes above and beyond to help her students shes extremely nice and her lectures really help explain difficult concepts and theories material is difficult if very little experience with theory but instructor provides engaging discussion to help learn and apply theory
5.0,W,this lady is so knowledgable and professsional but she keeps you interested and is absolutely hilarious at times no boring power point or online teach yourself know her content and how to really teach
1.5,W,taking my final class for my math minor which is online never had a problem understanding the subject matter in math classes but this woman really just does not teach she gives videos of her punching in numbers to excel sheets and expects you to understand the bigger picture any messages from her are rude and short with no personality
4.5,M,such a great professor very helpful funny and interesting lectures might get a little boring some days but for the most part the discussions were stimulating and thought provoking reading is pretty dense and heavy but he goes over it pretty clearly and answers all questions definitely turned out to be one of my favorite classes
5.0,M,my favorite prof at bcc tk him for comp if you get an a lazy do all the work if you get a b you probably belong in college prof ob made learning easynd fun i have no pblem writing research papers in all my classes thanks prof ob
1.0,M,best prof in bcc best i ever had in five semesters the man he makes learning fun and interesting take class
1.5,M,do not take him weeks to read the syllabus to us word for word days to split up the class into equal groups that you never talk to tests are online but impossible to pay attention in class so not easy very rude spends the first half hour of a minute class going over everything we did the day before miserable save yourself
2.0,M,well took two weeks for the syllabus a week and a half to split up into groups that you literally will never talk to he does not know how to answer questions well however does give extra points back on exams if many people argue the questions
1.0,M,alrighty where to start i guess at the very beginning the first class or should i say the first three classes were spent on just the syllabus seriouslly he read word for word i forgot we are in college and read very rude to other instructors not very computer knowledgeable took classes to split class of in to groups
2.0,M,whatever you do drink an amp or something before class he is sooo boring and very repetitive and it also took us literally two classes to divide into groups but the class is fairly easy all exams are online and open book
1.0,M,this class is ridiculous i would not recommend attendance mandatory but if you want to pass you should probably go interesting to listen to in class but there are only two exams solely based on stories he tells in class and i learned absolutely nothing about sociology
4.0,M,best professor i had in college he was my professor in the and changed my life by encouraging critical thinking and creative ideas
3.0,M,been out of college for years and still think about him unique and true changed my way of thinking about life sometimes a loaf of bread is just a loaf of bread
4.5,M,trav is great his class is more a philisophical look at sociology than a true scientific one but is well worth hearing his point of view his lectures are always amusing though it can be difficult to link his anecdotes to the subject material at times exams are easy and bend over backwards to help if you ask
5.0,M,he saved my life i came to the university in i had just gotten a ged and was enrolled in the talent devlopment program prof trav as everyone called him became my friend more than anything he listened to me and accepted my short comings made me feel i belonged and i was worthy of an education very dear man to me
1.0,M,worthless lump of a man currently in his class and does not teach his class sessions are him talking about unrelated topics and assigning a study guide spanning two chapters that he talk about at all then he has you turn them in and then do a test a few weeks later with the same questions terrible prof the book is the only teacher
2.5,W,absolutely terrible class boring and extremely feminist only bonus given away is only for women and some things she makes mandatory have no relevance to the class complete waste of time
5.0,W,shes a great and very professional person within days i was able to complete all my questions and most important part of her teaching is that she is taking her time to explain and wants every one to understand before move on to the next problem i would highly recommend her shes very pleasant thanks prof
5.0,W,she knows how to teach the math and you will never leave her class with questions on clarity gives homework everyday but its only to benefit you took her spring and i learnt a lot in her class you wont get a better education than what she can offer her students and she cares and will always help with any subject matter you may need
4.5,W,best math professor ever i took her for math and totally changed my whole perspective on math she gives homework everyday and goes over it the next day in class she is very patient and explains everything crystal clear she makes math fun i would take any of her over and over she gives two exams and the final
4.5,M,definitely a great professor graduated years ago and still remember mr james muckell as one of the best people ever met he made everyone feel as their family in fact he was like a dad to me those who try to tarnish his name should be ashamed pray for you guys
1.0,W,notes were online but incredibly disorganized and impossible to read homework took hours with unclear directions we spent weeks going over something that tested the midterm final and homework were all different she made her ta review the final during class time even though the ta seen the final yet could go on and on avoid
5.0,W,i took the summer field camp at the grad level taught by dr l she was an excellent instructor who was very organized and knew what she was talking about never having attended niu before dr l was very accommodating especially when i had trouble paying off my niu field camp fees and turning in my final essay for the class
1.5,M,all i can say is take this class if you want to learn self defense go to a real school not some week class where you are going to be abused physically and verbally oh and the teacher expects you to do his job and teach your peers not work with them but teach them if you do that you get yelled at
4.0,M,easy seems like he always had some idea of making money off of us students which i didnt appreciate easy class though just show up on time and take notes
3.5,W,okay so far i see that people are really harsh with comments but to be honest she that bad she do a good job at explaining how ever she pile on the work and her test impossible just read the textbook and she emphasizes doing end of chap questions which helped me my biggest pet peeve was her blackboard
1.0,W,without the textbook i would have learned nothing she teach you she expects you to look everything up she is a sweet lady but not a good teacher at all if you take her use the textbook to study for the notes in stopped taking notes cause worthless
3.5,M,attendance is not mandatory but going to class will help for exams exams read the book take notes on what he says
3.5,M,dr reardon is a little pompous and particular but once you understand the writing style he likes be fine this is not a blow off class so treat it like one or you will fail
4.5,M,really helpful if anything you need help with willing to help you students come first to him great professor class a blow off easy class like most think it is you have to work for the grade you get has good humor and is pretty cool guy make sure to come prepared to class at all sayin
5.0,M,this professor is amazing he was incredibly funny really had a love for film and knew all there was to know about it highly recommend taking this class over fosters if you love film the plus side is you have to buy fosters book new also just sit back take some notes and watch some great films
5.0,M,loved this class all you need to do is attend the movies he assigns and take notes he tells you everything that will be on the tests great professor very funny and very knowledgable
4.0,M,the class may be a bit more detailed note down what he tells you to note down or everything and buy the book be lazy on this one get the a tests one easy paper open although sometimes hard to find answers
1.0,M,dr sumner is the most worthless professor ever had he never replies to emails just gossips during class and help when requested i honestly know how been teaching as long as he has
1.5,M,horrible professor took his class online he never replies in weeks i sent emails he replied to with a rhetorical question of one line i understand the material and he does not care
1.0,M,dr sumner was absent throughout his online class i believe he might be the only professor that teaches the required qualitative statistical method course needed to gain a psych degree i will look to take elsewhere and transfer in credit i will never take a course w him again he wasted my i learned nothing
1.0,M,i took an online class with this professor he does not return emails or answer questions that student post on the discussion post if you ask him a direct question he will not answer it instead he will get nasty with you his instructions are not clear he does not enjoy teaching or care for his students will ruin your gpa do not take
3.5,W,i took into to cinema studies from her and loved it great teacher which allot of film experience she will work with you to sharpen your writing skills one of my favorite professors here on campus just be prepared to think outside the box about movies
5.0,M,bryan is awesome he knows his stuff he knows how to teach for understanding and how to make all subjects interesting he expects quite a lot but is always there to help i came out learning a ton and loving the subject
1.5,M,showed his assignments and emails to it personnel i work with and was adivsed that his class be of use in the real world
5.0,W,great professor i love this class she sso helpful and teaches in an interesting way the test and quiz was challenging but it was all good study cause you will need to know your stuff very fun class
5.0,W,she is a best professor we had project and exam i passed her class with a a or b i am not sure however she is helpful if you need a good grade and want to take the course i say take her class she is helpful and a great professor trust me
5.0,W,a great professor who give a fantastic introduction to the university if you have a chance to take her go for it
5.0,W,loved her she is a bit crazy but in a good way she genuinely wants her students to have a good grasp on the material if she is teaching any other upper level pr classes while at ut i will definitely sign up for them attendance mandatory but encouraged she gives in-classes quizzes pretty often worth a lot of your grade
2.0,W,she really contradicts herself you have to read the book before she teaches you or else you will get confused she rambles about her study abroad trip a good of most classes
5.0,W,dr white is by far the best teacher had at ut if you come to class and pay attention she will be incredibly helpful especially in office hours she gives pop quizzes but also gives at least opportunities to replace a bad quiz grade if you come to class overall helpful to the point and knows her stuff take this class for sure
2.5,W,she is a really great professor kind of hard to understand but it is very easy to get an a she takes up a lot of completion grades and some of the auditory quizzes she gives you the script before hand it is very hard to not do well
3.5,W,is a good teacher but when it comes to speechs she is a tough grader everything has to be perfect for you to get an a if you are looking for an easy a take this professor
4.0,W,professor reid is a very nice lady you do have to study but it take too much effort her class was interesting and can help with day to day life i enjoyed her class she is funny
5.0,M,an icon in his field personable with excellent taste
2.0,M,nice funny understanding about needing extensions on dates lectures are useless-read the book and use online tools instead he appears to have adhd either is redirecting because he understand the material or simply want to teach he keeps changing what he meant to talks about friends cars not math
1.0,M,he was really nice but did not seem to care about teaching or his students he makes an effort to explain and just meet the mark i knew more going into his class then i did leaving it he makes a lot of references to cars and real life that do not really make sense when discussing calculus i would not recommend taking him
1.0,M,do not take this teacher if he has any idea what doing which i doubt then he does a horrible way of explaining it all he does is act confused change his mind and say random things that make sense
1.0,M,he is a nice guy but did not explain subject matter well i had to go buy several books to self-teach practically moved into the math lab he does go on tangents and only explains how to do the simplistic part of a problem not good when the math lab tutors know what teacher you have by how confused you are nice guy but not thorough enough
4.5,W,a first year and i found her really helpful and easy to come to with any concerns she is really nice and seems passionate about what she is talking matter with lectures whether or not you come to you pay attention should be able to do really well
5.0,W,she is nice and easy going actually she does not trick you with the and its pretty obvious on what you will be tested on she is a fair marker though so she hard but she exactly easy either
5.0,W,the sweetest most caring professor encounter her passion for the material is infectious and she always tries to make tutorials interesting readings are mandatory in this class in fact the tutorials are more important than lecture clear on expectations but not an easy ride mima is a gold standard professor
5.0,W,one of my favorite teachers always willing to help you and is available after class if having trouble definitely recommend taking her
1.0,W,very rude her lessons are very confusing and unclear if you know the correct answer during class when teaching something new really rude about it and makes you feel stupid in front of the entire class her scoring is random and her attitude sucks
5.0,W,she made chemistry easy and understandable disappointed that she teaching chm
5.0,M,great instructor big on class participation do the reading and take good notes on what he says not just what is on the board some greek language needed to retain but not much be thick skinned because he can make you feel small but know that everyone there is exactly the same
4.0,M,great teacher if you pay attention and you are actually interested in philosophy most of the kids in my class who failed never paid attention you must be a good note taker and take notes about what he says not what he writes on the board great class though very useful really makes you think
4.0,M,if you enjoy participating in class you have to be thick-skinned pannos is a great teacher but if you give him the exact answer he is looking for he can be really dismissive not personal just his manner he is extremely knowledgeable but the only point of view that really matters is his own
2.0,M,he makes attendance mantory so if you want the participation you must go to every single class easy quizzes marking was unfair for midterm did not specify what he wanted but when he marked it was very specific the marks ranged from to take home final
3.0,M,i actually mind him as a teacher i felt i learned enough to get me through the rest of my smo classes the only thing is i feel his marking is sort of bi-polar i need awesome on the mid-term and project but then do well on the final which was take home even though i felt i answered the questions and he very helpful after
5.0,M,very easy quizzes and mc weekly quizzes short answer midterm take home final essay as long as you attend his lectures and pay attention you will do well he is unprofessional in presentations as he does tend to interrupt i didnt notice that adversely affecting my grade tho see him prior to presenting so u know what he expects
3.5,W,lots of books to buy for this class but they are all less then ten dollars sometimes less then or free cause some are on amazon if you are a person who does their work last minute all the time dont take the class she requires you to read chapters and discuss in class she has strict rules she will open your mind about the world big femenist
4.0,W,i am in this class now and was dreading taking because i like to read the class is run as a discussion group and we are required to write a paragraph or two about what we read and bring one to each class she lets you know expected first class she is funny and makes class go by fast i would absolutely reccommend her
4.0,M,paul was amazing he was so helpful in and out of class i learned so much in his class because we talked about everything i wish i could thank him for everything he did for me
1.0,W,keep looking not helpful and a terrible teacher she is not flexible at all even if you want to work ahead for one week i took her online course and i do not recommend it to even an enemy
2.0,W,only take her class if you have to if you can get a different teacher you should i took her online computer class and she constantly changed the times things were due and closed drop boxes and earlier than the time she said they would be closed on the syllabus she overly helpful with anything
5.0,M,dennis outlook is all his own and he particularly works from a cynical critical and contextual point of view not only is he extremely knowledgable and insightful but he is also hilarious and entertaining he is the best professor i have ever had and being his student was a pleasure and an honor
1.5,M,this is one of the worst classes i have ever taken his tests are ridiculously difficult my grad student for my lab was foreign and was incomprehensible and understand half of the questions we asked he asserted that over half the class failed the first exam bc we study enough run away
1.0,M,fairly unintelligent and narcissistic as the day is long if you accidentally make him feel threatened your grade will suffer as his grading method is entirely subjective
4.5,M,has a true passion for canadian literature and is one of the best professors to study under if you wish to learn more in that field he gets you into a routine of writing constantly which is tough at times but gets you engaged a little intimidating to speak in front of sometimes in the lectures but there are conferences and a discussion board
4.5,M,he specifically sets up the assignments to make everyon arrive in class having done the readings and to help people keep up and do well it was tough having a mini paper due twice a week but then we got to revise them and submit the worth all together for the grade no midterm or final he encourages discussion and coming to his office
2.5,M,take this class if you have really good vision cause he writes in like font on the board and if you like sleeping because what be doing in this class a really knowledgeable professor but he know how to put it into use and his voice makes most people sleepy tests are pretty hard too
3.0,M,omg i took intro to physiological psych and i hated the class so much i had a really hard time trying to pass every single detail that he speaks about in class is in the test things that you would think be on the the test are on the test he is funny in a weird way and he knows his stuff but he teach and the class is so difficult
5.0,M,this professor really knows his stuff because he is really knowledgeable in this area he sometimes forgets that his students may not be so you need to ask him to explain in a different way he also tries to explain the theories using lots of examples and dumbs things down so everyone gets it exams are hard and require work but he is a great
5.0,M,dr scanlin is such a great guy all he wants is for his students to pass his class and do great after graduation you pretty much watch movies every other class and he rarely takes attendance before a test he gives you loads of questions and the answers you just have to memorize them this class is a great gpa booster
4.5,M,extremely nice professor was not a bad class for how dry the material was allows one page of notes for exams would recommend him to others
4.5,M,dr exams are notorious for being difficult they are based on conceptual understanding so studying the night before is not suggested that said if you are having trouble understanding he will help you during office hours or over email he is one of the nicest professors you will have
1.0,M,he is horrible i should have gotten an a in his class and he tanked my a at the very last second based on a group project that he only graded half of he graded the word document but not the required powerpoint presentation beware he is not a far professor
1.5,W,on the first day of class she stated she was not a statistician she literally only writes definitions on the board and nothing else she likes to repeat how much she doesnt know about stats and that she only knows math not really worth taking the class unless you dont want to learn how to calculate the actual stats
2.5,W,it was a complete surprise to me on the first day of class basically she is the human version of the textbook she really know statistics and even admitted that most of the time be writing stuff on the board writing down formulas and doing example problems half the time i understand the purpose behind it
3.5,M,good professor math is not an easy subject for me and i ended up getting a b in the class definitely make sure he knows who you are and that you actually care about getting a good grade it will help you in the end going into his office for help is definitely worth it
4.0,M,overall a good professor probably the best that teaches my only complaints are that he moves pretty fast when doing problems on the board and erases his work from the board pretty fast he does help students a lot in his office but he seems to get frustrated easily overall good professor though i would recommend him
5.0,M,timely on grading he made the subject interesting and used thought provoking questions and great examples i would look for this teacher for future classes
5.0,W,she was the knees
4.0,W,a conservative grassroots activist and i expected the worst walking into a condit class there are rumors her class challenged me intellectually more than any other class had at vcu were this a sword battle i would bow and compliment her on a well-fought engagement take condit especially if conservative
2.5,W,ridiculously rambling lectures made it halfway through the syllabus by the end of the semester and instead talked about her passions of feminism and hating children tests are all multiple choice and draw from the lectures the class is easy and she curves everything just know that every lecture you go to is going to feel like five hours
4.5,W,if you have not taken a condit class you are crazy she is an amazing person helpful and understanding however her class is not structed by any means very inconsistent with due dates and assignments class discussions are great and will always keep you interested she really makes you think oh be prepared for a group project
1.0,M,sounds like a great teacher in the class room however online is the worst grading rubric in the world he gave me a for an assignment out of which i did complete in entirety not even one point for trying i would never recommend him for an online class
4.5,M,he was a wonderful professor very busy man because he is always willing to help people in his spare time he was also the head of the chem department he is one of my favorite professors class is a little difficult but he is so great at what he does that is not dreadful i highly recommend that you take any chemistry class you can with him
4.5,M,the most magnificent professor ever a genius he is dedicated to helping you out and is just excellent at his job his class may not be easy but he is willing to explain things and help you out as much as willing to be helped best professor at denison
5.0,M,fantastic helpful kind challenging inspiring and in one of his favorite words commendable lucky you to have this fabulous professor for chemistry
5.0,M,i signed up for his class at am first semester and realize how hellish waking up that early would be with my workload but when it came time for choosing my second semester chem class and the only available time with dr k was again i gladly signed up to have him as the professor
5.0,M,dr kuhlman is a fantastic professor he is chair of both the chemistry and biochemistry departments and so can provide fantastic examples for his teaching from both physical and life sciences he appear to sleep we receive emails from him at in the morning and then another at am he holds regular and on demand review sessions
5.0,W,one of the best professors at york extremely intelligent passionate and beautiful she is also very nice helpful and understanding she gives the best lectures at york there are a lot of readings but its not necessary to do them all and not hard to get an a
4.5,W,the most passionate had at york she loves what she does must read the text really interesting fair marker museum assignment is time consuming but great she uses videos for some of her lectures and everything she covers in lecture is posted study read text do reflections and assign and do well

5.0,W,amazing really helps you succeed and her classes are very interesting
4.0,M,i expected him to be hard but he is really clear about what he wants and if you just do what you are supposed to you will make a good grade i hate public speaking but he made it not so bad i notice that everyone who ranks him poorly is a poor maybe they had problems in his class because they just very bright
5.0,W,i love her she keeps all of her students engaged in what learning and so funny definitely one of my favorite professors do everything you can to take her she grades papers super easily and give a lot of tedious work but buy the textbook i have never used mine
4.5,W,she is a very educated woman she knows what she is talking about her tests are pretty difficult but she gives projects that boosts your grades a lot if you go to class and take decent notes it is not hard to earn at least a b
5.0,W,nothing negative to say about her one of my favorite professors at upg love working with her and highly recommend her lectures are crystal clear and lenient about meeting up to get help actually enjoys her job
3.5,M,love this professor his accent thick at all compared to many other professors taken really helpful and tries to make sure everyone understands the problems before moving on and really funny i would definitely take his class again
2.5,M,awesome professor has a thick accent could barely understand anything he says but got used to it after the first week he teaches well drops the lowest test grade he is one funny dude
5.0,M,very helpful professor i took him during summer we were moving pretty fast but he was always concern that everyone get the topics he also make you participate during class working out problems and it help alot use the book is very helpful and it could be the difference from a a to a b ooo yea and he is very funny
4.5,M,i love this man he is the best chemistry professor if u hate and dont understand jack sht then take him he explains really well gives alot of examples and doesnt move on until hes sure everybody gets it the book isnt needed but it helps cos u do problems off of it and it helps for the exams hes funny too great overall
5.0,M,great professor everyone complains that he makes you sing and dance if late just be late he definitely broke me out of my shell and made public speaking easier on me take christie he knows what doing and does it so fun
4.5,M,this professor is a challenge this is no easy ride and you should be thankful for that you learn how to speak publically and debate plus if struggling he gives you a chance to pass a lot of feedback and extra credit so nearly no excuse to fail you work for your grade in this class i love this professor awesome
5.0,M,i took this class online and it was really easy you read the book complete the assignment do a quiz once a week then the final test questions are from the assignments he is also very responsive if you need help
4.5,M,literally the easiest class you will ever take weekly quizzes that are based off of readings easy to get and the final is all of the quizzes is online kind of sad he gets paid to teach this class when he doesnt do anything
5.0,M,great professor take his course without any consideration do something at home and you ll be fine
4.0,M,anyone who says the prof is not helpful probably they ask for help prof hassan is very helpful and caring he omitted one of the required assignments so we can increase our a killer it required someone who study overall take another class with him
1.0,M,took his online course worst experience so far in university year offers no help and doesnt provide proper info on anything first assignment was the most vague piece of everyone i showed as ever seen shame on york for hiring him to educate the new was of statisticians and business people
2.0,M,do not take internet section with him the course is easy especially if u have studied adms he does not gives any feedback about the assignments and mid terms when i e-mailed him for his office hours twice he never responded take this course in fall or winter a lecture avoid the internet section overall a bad experience for me
5.0,M,i really liked class he like to be called professor he was really helpful and made things easy to understand most test questions are graded right or wrong but the questions are very similar to the homework and the practice problems in class does things old school using papers for notes using overhead camera
5.0,M,bob is a great professor he is old school and uses an overhead so you pretty much have to go to class because he does not utilize e-learning except to post the syllabus if you go to class and pay attention he gives you every opportunity to make an a he thoroughly explains everything and does several practice problems in class take him
4.5,M,his exam questions all came from the example problems in class you knew what to expect on the exam easy a if you attend class and rework the examples his passion for finance and his jokes every now and then made the class enjoyable considering finance
2.5,M,i doubt for a minute most of those posts about his great sense of humor and how a good professor he is were posted by the same bender he uses the projector to show old sheets he probably has been using for the last years som should pride to have a real good professor for this core class his jokes were probably funny years ago
5.0,W,she is the best
5.0,W,where do i begin dr waterhouse has to be the best professor had at calu thus far extremely kind and caring not mention helpful i had her for wednesday night class and she actually made me want to go to class i definitely recommend her to everyone
4.5,W,i highly recommend taking your eng with her extremely nice and understanding the class hard at all as long as you follow her instructions always there to help if you are confused only downsides are that she does not post grades on and rarely checks her e-mail
4.0,W,online version highly recommended to take after you finished many similar mathematical concepts the tests are simple if you do your readings all open book the exam was ridiculously easier than i thought just do the easy practice questions in the textbook and online modules when i met her in person she was extremely friendly
3.0,M,prof lectures were directly out of the book they were a good review of the readings but they tended to get very boring and monotonous he had interesting stories but the majority of the lectures were him reviewing book material his tests are worded in an extremely tricky manner as well
4.5,M,professor giarratani is one of the best professors had at pitt he has a genuine love of economics and it shows in his teaching all his examples are crystal clear and are applicable to the real world i guarentee even if you are not interested in economics still leave the class feeling more informed and prepared for life after college
2.0,M,thought i wanted to be an econ major until i took this class some people did well if they made it their entire life but i thought frank was irrelevant and boring his wording is nothing like the book so it was easy to get confused not a great teacher but if you really need the course easy to get a c so take it at pitt
5.0,M,such a great professor sweet and funny guy loves economics and traveling his voice is sort of boring but he keeps his lectures relevant tests are mostly multiple choice and very realistic big on learning the material instead of testing like crazy loved the class honors section
5.0,W,i took her for fiction shes a great critic and will force you to improve your writing but the class is not too hard she also assigns great readings go to her office hours to work on your stuff with her shes even better one-on-one
3.0,W,she is kind of a hippie but none the less as long as you attend and are involved you will get a good grade
4.0,W,english with greta is very laid back a good teacher and likes to engage the class a lot i say a hard grader but you get what you put in she really likes participation and gives reading assignments for homework the reading can be boring but too long very possible to receive an a in her class
4.5,M,an old fashioned lectures-only teacher stands up there with an old projecter that uses transparencies and just drones on the whole time nice guy though knows his stuff and teaches it well no homework either if you are good with just an occasional test and can show up every day and pay attention pretty great
2.5,M,first and foremost the stereotypical professor that stands in front of class and just talks at you until time is up even though i like history it was pretty boring you never have homework though just lectures and tests i mind him but i certainly want to take his class again
3.0,M,i took him for woh and euh for history want any other professor than him i like his lecturing but i wish he puts a mini quiz towards every class so we could get more pts i never bought the book and passed both of his class with a c exams no finals points maximum attendance is mandatory so miss out
3.5,M,not doubt passionate about his subject and his multiple choice portions are fairly easy however memorizing the entire history the roman empire will get you no more than a c on his exams so strict i once told him perhaps i was studying incorrectly and if something i should focus on he said just study
5.0,W,very thorough sleep on the index cards she gives out they really work she allows a retake if needed very fair and wants everyone to succeed one of the best instructors at tcc a gem
4.0,W,is one of the best teachers that ive had tcc she is very patient and will work with you i absoultely hate math but ms dameron made the class tolerable my suggestion would be to take her
5.0,W,time taking this others i made if you understand she takes time patiently walks you through it can be retaken until you get a grade happy with at the end of the semester if you happy with one of your test grades retake it if you are happy with all grades you have to go to class the last few days
4.5,W,i took the main summer online class it was great for a math-which i really do not like you use course compass she uses scanned powerpoints to teach the sections but i really just looked over them and focused on the textbooks chapter videos they help because it shows step by step great class but online is a lot of work but very do-able
3.5,M,this class is no joke he give tests the whole semester and drops the lowest test score if u do the extra credit points so if u have and did all the extra credit have a b in the class he is pretty helpful if you go to his office the class is hard as wouldnt take the class u like science this will be ya boy
3.0,M,i like him jolly fellow but he does run through things a tad quickly the class itself is hard you cannot half ass this course study
4.0,M,mr daniels is a very nice man he uses all of his time wisely and if you attend class regularly you be surprised by the different quizzes he assigns he has an outline for every unit test one thing to know is that there are things on the test that are not on the outline you nerd the book to do really well on the tests
4.5,W,for a summer online class this was easy she lets you work ahead you only have and she gives you optional due dates i think pretty easy but like all online classes you have to do a bit of work quiz a week discussion and one exam but most of them are easy and at your own pace not timed nice summer class
2.0,W,i would not recommend her at least not for an online class she respond to emails in a reasonable amount of time and she is not very helpful she also makes turning assignments in much more difficult than it needs to be this is the worst online class ever taken
2.0,W,i will never take another online class again because of her
1.0,W,if you find out that you have her as a professor for either design or drawing you need to immediately request changing classes she should have retired years ago
2.5,W,very hard to follow slide presentations are unlabeled making images difficult to identify crucial for exams tough grader but the tests are doable the case study was a nightmare while morna was willing to help through email and meeings her criticism was never constructive or helpful make sure you use the ta
5.0,M,he changed my life for the better
5.0,M,everything said is true he is completely fantastic the best had he cares about his students and wants you to do well he is very straightforward and understandable but even if you struggle he will help its not a blowoff and he takes attendance but going to class and doing all the work helps alot most test questions from the
5.0,M,prof burk is literally the best professor i hate math and he made the class bearable moreover he is always willing to help and always responds to email recommend him for business calc
5.0,M,professor burk is the best math teacher ever had he loves what he does and makes sure everyone understands what he is teaching he is always willing to help and is truly such a nice would recommend taking his business calculus class i got an a if you do all the homework and study for quizzes and tests set for an a
3.5,M,pretty funny guy the class got off topic a lot always willing to meet w students during office hours to clarify any misunderstandings i missed more than a few classes it had no affect on my grade old tries to be funny very nice understanding guy excepted my late work take his class easy a
5.0,W,everybody has to take speech aarggh thankfully i got a great teacher she was very encouraging and got the class to encourage each gotta do the work but she helps you and always keeps on top of reminding you when due which helps a bit scatterbrained sometimes
3.0,M,his lectures are boring and just talk does hand out notes his test are amazing not easy but well made you can reason out questions and he will accept them if your reasoning is sound not a my way or the high way teacher as long as you prove your answer learn the fundamentals of physics by heart and you will pass his class
1.5,W,med term online easy course prof jost is completely hands off she does not respond to phone calls or email takes several weeks to grade assignments
4.5,M,very helpful and wants you to succeed bring your text book and a calculator come to class do not be late study study study you will pass his class and the compass if your listen and do what he tells you to do dr hardy wants you to pass and he is there for you thanks to mr hardy i am out of math and well on my way
4.5,M,dr hardy is a wonderful teacher that knows what he is talking about a math wiz come to class be on time he seems tough but he is preparing you for the compass exit exam and wants you to understand the material he is very helpful come prepared bring your book and listen in class i passed math compass exit exam thank you dr hardy
5.0,M,dr george is an excellent professor if you do the work and go to class you will do fine he is also very willing to help any students who ask
1.5,M,he may be smart and know his stuff but he is a horrible professor and i love physics he constantly talks down to the class and acts like he is revolutionizing your world view or like you have never thought about the universe before he rushes over formulas and never does them with you he just shows a slide of how he did them
5.0,M,igreat professor you can tell passionate about the subject and clearly expresses his expectations also very helpful with papers and assignments you really need to read the books because of the films as long as you participate in discussions and get on his good side which be hard if you go to class do fine
1.0,W,talks way too much about herself makes unfunny side of which have anything to do with the course which is actually despite her very interesting if you want eye-candy there are other places to look not hot not funny just not
4.5,W,i had her for two classes in one semester advertising society and media history of ny definitely knows her stuff about advertising and increased my knowledge and interest in the subject but she is a tough grader
5.0,W,had her for advertising and society extremely clear knows what talking about class was straight forward so there was no need to go to her to ask questions definitely need to study for but easily comprehensible material
3.5,M,ted is a great teacher and you really learn a lot in his class his tests require a lot of studying but they too bad he gives many assignments but they are mostly interesting overall lectures were usually interesting sometimes they were quite boring
4.0,M,i had him for business of media i learned a lot in the class but he really teach everything was mostly self-taught due to the weekly blog posts he was interesting and had cool speakers and the workload was pretty heavy a lot of writing but i do see the advantages of taking this class as it is very applicable to the real world
4.5,M,i really enjoyed ted magder his lectures were interesting and relevant i appreciated his interest in his students opinions on current events and his humorous approach to teaching also he hardcore reminds me of steve jobs
1.5,M,nothing against him the course material was not for pick a media sector either games or music read the trades and blog then write a pg research paper this class has no critical and you hear stories about his famous friends and his soccer has a soothing voice
2.5,M,a really nice guy but awful at lecturing he could put you to sleep his lectures were unorganized and make sense help with the way to much reading and dead boring texts not clear on what exams were based on his notes never make sense fair marker dead boring but kind and lenient
4.0,M,i found dr hynes very helpful he had a thorough knowledge of the course material and an overly hard marker he tended to lean towards the philosophical side of c european history which my area of interest but it too difficult he could stand to be a bit more exciting but i found him to be a really good prof
1.5,M,pretty useless enjoys walking around the class and rambling he do the actual marking but his teaching assistant marks fairly though slowly give notes and hard to tell what you should write down since he includes so much irrelevant content in his lectures take philosophy with flynn instead if you want
5.0,W,this was my first mcc class i took and i loved every second she is the nicest person and always listens to what you have to say she is extremely clear and knowledgeable of the subject there is a lot of work but the essays are fun topics and if you do the work you should be fine
4.5,W,professor sussman is my favorite instructor at nyu thus far i was nervous at first because i like speaking out in class but she makes everyone feel comfortable and i feel like i have learned immense amounts in this course she is always friendly and although she gives a lot of work it is worth it especially if you plan on being an mcc major
5.0,W,best professor had thus far hands down she genuinely cares about her students and is an overall awesome person the class is very discussion based so very lively and student driven all of the things she expects you to know are in her presentations so honestly no need to read the stuff she assigns but most is cool take her
5.0,W,great professor you get to know in the isom program takes a vested interest in students and makes a huge effort to assist in any way possible labs were engaging and better than powerpoint lectures stay on her good side and get to know her had her times now for my info sys major she is very knowledgeable and a great professor to take
2.5,M,are silly ridiculous structure not cohesive and fails to resemble an academic paper follow his instructions and avoid using any original thought or creative exploration his lectures are repetitive and antidotal and often adress the subject no possibility of a shared learning experience because he already knows everything
4.0,M,had him for history of comm last semester work load hard but was tedious had to write essays on every few chapters of his book for lectures he basically recited his book that he wrote so no one went to class easy grade
5.0,M,paul was the voice that i needed when i was just coming into my own as an artist and photographer he made me concentrate on mediums outside of my comfort zone and was critical but encouraging i be where i am without him
3.5,M,took this for my theme class tons of writing and reading but hey its english cultural events were actually very interesting and enjoyable i did a few extras of those class time is just book discussion and i hope the soccer book is never used again and most people in the class feel the same way he was very upset when he found this out
2.5,M,class is more like a book club class was huge about people call you out for talking or leaving early so dont do it actually stop class until you contribute you learn a lot from the cultural events you attend its hard to get into the grove of writing pages a week in blogs because he wants them done a very certain way
4.5,W,very friendly helpful and responds to questions outside of class quickly complete assignments and speeches the exact way she lays out she is sort of my way or the highway but lays out the requirements clearly do exactly what she says and get an a or b no problem she grades attendance and missing class causes major points off
5.0,W,at first when attending class it seemed like it would be a ton of work this turned out to be one of the best classes ever taken she works with students and the students present on the theories in class a great way to learn we did activities and got to know everyone in the class honestly one of the best professors ever had
3.5,W,the class that bad but she the best professor the whole class is having groups teach a chapter this is fine but she interrupts a lot during presentations and let the group complete what they were saying
1.0,W,we were supposed to learn how to write a literature review what the difference between a research question and a hypothesis is how to write acedemic papers at the graduate level instead we wrote undergrad level papers about our feelings no instruction from her on how to find previous research had no idea how to write a lit review epic fail
2.5,W,well i came into this class with a high expectation of this professor since friends of mine really enjoyed her class i found her extraordinarily difficult she has you write numerous papers that have questions that are very difficult she expects masters level work out of a undergraduate class take her unless you have lots of time
3.5,M,he is a good professor who is not a difficult grader he wants students to do well in the class and gives tests that reflect the class material sometimes is a little all over the place during lecture but overall pretty clear and easy to undertsand
3.0,M,great guy kinda awkward and really hard he is way too smart to be teaching an intro class he cannot connect with normal people
5.0,M,i had dr gallaher for creative writing poetry and he is awesome to have as a teacher really laid back and he made the class really fun and i always looked forward to it and went to every class though he care about attendance i liked him so much i even made him my advisor definitely would recommend any of his creative writing courses
4.0,W,she is more interested in her music math classes than in this one for sure but overall is a good teacher if you get something the first time reteach it to you in a different way in office hours works with all types of learners must attend class if want if you want but expect her to help you if stuck
3.0,M,class is not an easy a but its not horrible theres weekly papers two tests and a final exam the tests consist of mc and essay he hands out potential essay questions a week in advance mc choice questions are difficult but writing a decent essay is enough to make up for that overall he is a really nice prof even though the class is hard
1.5,M,do not take him papers every single friday on what we talked about in class you have to fit every reading in the paper somewhere and theres at least readings its awful at least reading for each class gives no help even if you ask tests are impossible find a different teacher if you are taking this class
4.0,W,absolutely brilliant professor she could probably write a music theory textbook herself if she busy teaching every class and doing research sometimes too brilliant to understand but always more than willing to help you and look over your projects as well also really really adorable fun class
5.0,W,great professor very intelligent inspiring and truly cares about students gotta love her
4.0,W,great professor very knowledgable in her field i took intro to international relations with her it was a hard class but if you actually go to lecture and read the textbook it bad she can be kind of jumpy with material sometimes but makes the content easy to understand lots of extra credit opportunities as well would recommend
2.0,W,she knows her stuff but the tests are impossible lectures are boring and i find it hard to understand what teaching discussion help much either
3.0,W,dr hosseini was a great professor my only problem was she throws a lot of info at you for her exams so make sure to study even if people tell you she curves count on it very nice though and the course load is light take her
4.0,W,if you want an easy a because you took high school spanish take her if you want to learn how to speak spanish please take her cristina no h in the first her stuff she does assign a lot of homework all homework is required to be turned in to receive a grade tough but she gives many extra credit opportunities
4.5,W,was an intensive class so it only last weeks so you have to engulf yourself in the class i enjoyed it and having spanish before i really appreciated her style shes culturally rich with info and breaks the language down very well do not take with very challenging classes as this will consume you with hw but take her
3.5,W,she needs to reconsider her teaching style she is very clear but she rushes and the class have a lot of conversation practice activities
5.0,W,intimidating at first and can be a little snappy when you clearly done the work but a spectacular professor and really cares about the students who are willing to put in the effort the class itself is a lot of work and it meets every day but you learn a ton from her
5.0,W,i took chinese and lit classes with wang laoshi and found she was a passionate brilliant empathetic and kind prof she works harder for her students than most profs could even imagine she always chooses fascinating material to teach in lit classes and is structured and thorough in chinese classes just amazing
3.5,M,took as an elective after a year of no spanish classes this is not an easy class plan for hw everyday including research papers movie responses he talks a lot but good you need to hear spanish to learn actually kind pop quizes exams-prompts in advance ask questions in class he will answer them thoroughly
3.0,M,moody hard to rate him because one day wonderful helpful and nice and the next a total grouch critical and nasty he can be a tough grader but if you show interest and really give it your all not too bad i think a nice guy deep down just moody show him that your serious and it goes a long way
2.0,M,i am a current student of his and i have to say that the man is convoluted to say the least he makes nothing clear his grading system is a mess and he is not as responsive to students concerns with his class as you would hope the text is informative i will admit but you feel right during or after his my opinion
3.0,M,prof panzarella is firm but fair he lets you determine your grade thru attendance quizzes and writing assgnmts he gives no breaks and very strict but as long as you miss anything and complete all your work you will do great i had a problem understanding an assgnmt and he explained it to me so that i could understand it better
3.0,M,this class too difficult the exams are pure memorization so if you memorize the notes its really easy to get an a he is sometimes unclear in the lectures but he really knows what talking about class was sometimes boring and attendance mandatory
4.5,M,really great teacher very interested in the content he is teaching and is legitimately interested in his students and their learning he enjoys getting to know his students and values content and concepts of writing over grammar i hope to take another class with him
2.5,W,before taking this class i thought the reviews would be wrong but they are all accurate she calls on you out of no where collects homework days after it was due grades unfairly if possible take a different section
5.0,M,he was one of the best teachers i have ever had he taught practical application in his class he did not give you a grade that you did not earn if you participate and do your work you should pass
1.5,M,probably the worst professor had in my college career so far keep track of grades and let you know until last minute if you are missing anything my entire grade was changed because he tried to tell me my paper was late when it late at all i would not suggest him
2.0,M,worst prof ever had really inconsistent grading never keeps track of papers after you turn them in and never fully explains assignments never makes himself available to talk or explain anything expects you to check your email every day but never responds to anything you send him also classes without much notice avoid him
4.5,M,great professor i was considering changing my major until i took his class truly loves teaching and is very helpful expects you to know due dates in the syllabus a lot of online assignments overall a great teacher recommend for any class
2.5,M,i put hard work into it got a on the midterm and he still gave me a b
5.0,M,vinnie teaches his students that the pursuit of knowledge is not a burden but a worthy goal some find his classes stressful because the learning process is not as painful as they have grown to expect his lectures are not for the cynics and jaded of heart keep your mind open and you will learn more than you thought possible with so much peace
5.0,W,best class ever she made us learn the material and design
5.0,W,best class ever she makes the class learn and enjoy the process very creative
5.0,W,mrs hays is very sweet yes she is old-school where not allowed to have drinks in the she wants you to pass she provides much much extra credit if you show trying love her good lady classes are easy tests are hard if you study
2.0,W,she seems like a really sweet lady but is one of the toughest teachers ever i basically had to teach myself everything and her deadlines are super early attendance is mandatory and she is speaks in a monotone voice which makes the class more of a bore i do not recommend her
1.0,W,this class was very boring and she was trying to go over everything without any clarification she was so focused on getting it done rather than making sure we actually learned the material
4.0,W,great class i really enjoyed attending took the summer course and ms maguire is an amazing teacher really enjoyed her lectures as long as you focus and study awesome
1.0,W,this woman is a terrible teacher she teaches directly off of her powerpoints but she even know the material the first test is material from high school and is easy but after that i never made higher than a the final is a state exam super easy i know how but i made an a
5.0,M,dr cavaiola is extremely knowledgeable and is a great communicator he makes the class interesting and insightful he also goes out of his way for students who need help he is a seasoned and fun professor who is a fair and honest grader
2.0,M,dr caviola seems nice until he gets you will see his other be fooled
5.0,M,dr cavaiola is an amazing professor had him for psychopathology and he is the only professor you want for this class he is very clear class is entertaining and he has a wealth of information if you need help all you need to do is ask
5.0,M,he is a great is not an easy class no matter where you take he is very helpful and will answer all of your questions and he does not test you over things that he did not cover in lec test are very easy and just have to do your part and read and great teacher
5.0,M,he is a very creative professor loved his lectures there is a lot of reading but all the novels are completely worth reading highly suggest him
4.5,W,she knows her material and she wants her students to succeed
2.5,W,i had this teacher for news writing she grades way too hard for students who are just learning news writing i was extremely interested in news writing and been on my high school newspaper staff and the editor of it still got on papers i turned in says she lecture much opposite is true
1.0,W,i had her for newswriting and she is very unclear and tests are over too much information to even study for most assignments seem unplanned and on the spot most days there are no power points provided and basically on your own i do not recommend this teacher if truly interested in news writing and enhancing your skills
5.0,W,around and movies one of which you read and are to read up to a certain point in the story and then it is discussed in class she gives you a set of essay questions on each reading of which will appear on the exam and you pick one to write on along with passage ids from the stories parts you identify and explain
5.0,W,the course starts of hard and gets easier as the semester goes on by design you finish up by watching and analyzing movies attendance is not mandatory but she keeps track of it for participation read read read and come to class to succeed bs will not work on exams as she can see right through it bring texts to class in order to follow along
5.0,W,loved this class kind of started off with difficult reading material but gets way easier as the semester goes on she does this on purpose very engaging and funny makes class interesting attendence not mandatory but she passes a sheet for participation very easy and fun class easy to pass but if you dont read the material she will know
5.0,W,best professor ever funny fun great discusssions explians material well and very helpful this class is challenging but no one learns anything from easy classes not that much reading analyze movies at end of semester i looked forward to class knows all her students her enthusiasm made me more excited to be a english minor
5.0,W,prof gilson is one of those rare professors who takes pride in what she does she is by far the most enthusiastic prof ever had and agree the first time you have class with her her lectures are very interesting and keep your attention the exams can be difficult but only if you do the reading and attend class great prof
3.5,M,loved him but found that the class was more like a lit theory class as opposed to romantic lit some readings are very dry you really have to force yourself to get into them although he does a very good job of making the readings clear and interesting my lowest mark in university i only just passed and worked very hard but still loved allard
3.5,M,amazing lecturer one of the best at brock for sure enthusiastic knowledgeable and injects a lot of humour into his lectures fairness is another question not saying impossible to get a good mark in his class but i will say that be disappointed not the most helpful outside of class and class averages are abysmal audit
4.0,M,the teacher is a little rude and sarcastic at first but he eases up on it in the long class self taught course and collaborating with peers help you need to network with peers take home final take home midterm instructor is absent a lot but ok at the end of the class you will have answers if you ask the questions he loves qts
4.0,W,ms yearwood class can be intensive sometimes but she is a very good teacher makes sure you learn the material and expects you to remember it can be funny at times and mean at the same time she does a lot for her students and the school can be a great advisor
2.5,M,good at the subject and u do learn from his class however he sees attendance way more than efforts u put in he bother to know ur unforeseen difficulties just be there on time even ur body or situations not allow u to do so keep ur finger cross that ur body fail u or run into any kind of emergencies during the weeks
5.0,M,everyone is entitled to their opinion jim ever criticize any artwork but will give his opinion to improve on it meaning take it home and touch up on it for the final portfolio you be lazy in his class or you will get the grade you deserve he will give you his undivided attention as long as you need
4.5,M,not going to lie this class is pretty hard granted i got an a but i had already taken regular drawing classes before and worked really hard jim is a good professor pretty helpful when demonstrating homework assignments and critiques he lets you redo the work for a higher grade which i think is great manuel the is awesome
4.5,M,jim is a great teacher ive had him for times as a teacher if you dont like to draw or your a slacker dont take his class youll be wasting his time as well as the other class mates if your competitive and want to improve on your drawing then this his class in my opinion anyone who has gave a bad remark is full of it
5.0,M,easily one of the best ilr professors out there the way he teaches eliminates the need for traditional math or calculations and instead requires you to critically think and understand data exceptionally smart but very approachable tests are fair but can be tricky grades are curved at the end
4.0,M,mr p was very helpful to me this was my first year at college and taking eng so some things were a little bit dificult for me but with the help of mr pouncy i was able to pass the class and i thank him for all that he has helped me with
4.0,M,took online class very easy some of the answers are wrong on the tests and after showing him where it said otherwise in the book he quickly changed the grade he will reopen tests if you want a better grade never met but i would recommend
5.0,M,professional ethics was maybe the most interesting and engaging class i have taken at wayne corvino wanted us to be involved in the discussion and found a way to make a potentially boring subject really interesting if you came to class and read the material then you were pretty much set up for an a i definitely recommend a class with him
5.0,M,one of my favorite courses at wsu corvino is very engaging has a light personality which gets you interested in the material make sure to keep up on all the readings and come to every class as his insight into the readings gives much clarity very helpful when needed exams are not difficult if you follow the readings and notes he gives
4.0,M,dr corvino is very smart individual and a good professor his course was fair there are a lot of readings so make sure to keep up with them and actually understand them four exams all with the same weight make up the grade so prepare well in advance for them
4.0,M,some of this stuff can be confusing or not interesting for most people there are a lot of readings so be prepared the number one mistake is not showing up to class his lectures and class discussions give a lot more clarity to the content not bad but kind of a demanding prof
2.0,M,i will acknowledge that a fantastic conductor however he is lacking as a professor perpetually late and mostly talks about himself rather than the subject matter
5.0,W,awesome teacher she introduced me to sign lang and now i want to interpret she really cares for her students and supports them she also makes sure your grasp the importance of facial expressions though the class in normally later in the day-you will enjoy attending this class
4.5,W,i absolutely loved coming to this class sherry is such an awesome teacher she made learning asl very easy her facial expressions were hilarious
5.0,W,excellent prof made uninteresting material quite interesting very helpful get her while still here
5.0,M,he is my favorite teacher by far he is so enthusiastic about everything he teaches this class is a wonderful history class and if you want to learn about religion or crazy roman fights or scandelous stories then take this class from mark i seriously would of had to try to get a bad grade on the tests cause they were that easy
5.0,W,always go to class the points can bring you down if you miss the quizes can be hard so read your book bother trying to google find many answers she is very helpful so ask for help
5.0,M,take his you wont regret it if i had any problems it would be he graded the work really late but i ended up with an a i probably learned more about religion in weeks than in religious classes that are year long
5.0,M,one of the best professors ever i took the class over summer and wished it was a week class he has a great presence about him that makes you want to pay attention and be present for every class as for the workload adequately planned for the length of class time three quizzes response paper and group proj take his class
4.5,M,best professor ever a hard course but if you take advantage that he is there to help you will succeed he will answer or clarify any concerns you may have not only i enjoyed this class but i learned a lot huge tip read your texbook if you you will be lost and it will be much harder to understand his lectures
4.5,M,great guy that understands what it is like to work and go to school he is always available and puts out extra helping instruction just listen and follow close because sometimes he switches gears and may loose you if your not on the ball
4.0,M,great professor really enjoyed his class study your terms in book take the quiz each week and be fine take attendance but must take the quizzes get out early a lot after about the first weeks of class has a good sense of humor definitely recommend his class for anyone know anything when i started and got an a
1.0,W,the class has no use at all powerpoints useless when you ask questions she skips over them not answering them she know how to use a computer she figure out how to log on to the computer one class so we do anything every class she repeats herself on what she said in the first class of the semester overall very boring
4.0,W,mrs allen is not the best teacher ever had she has no personality making it very hard to connect with her and she is very monotone she does give you the terms needed to study for the test but just not terms there are all kinds of required things to learn for the tests like procedures terms different diseases etc
4.5,M,the class was hard but not beyond what someone in an honors math class should be able to manage he gave up his own time for a problem session and was helpful with office hours highly recommended
5.0,M,i took this class on line this summer dr coleman was extreemly helpful and quick with getting back to me with any questions i struggled a bit at the beginning but he kept with me and was encouraging through the course i wound up getting an a i would highly recommend him
1.0,W,i took her online her test are really hard way harder than they should be she isnt very helpful at all when you ask her questions her response is usually one sentence long basically if i could go back definitely take someone else i usually do these but i look at them and wanted to help others out make her your last choice
5.0,W,super easy class she gives extra points for attending class there is a lot of work but it is very easy as long as you show up to class and listen to how to do it i would recommend her for sure
5.0,W,i took her printmaking class it was very fun it is not like a highschool art class where you just make art and it is cool you must try to make good composition she cares more about that than subject matter if you can understand the way she thinks then you can figure out what she wants and do it she is a great teacher and knows her stuff
2.0,W,i took her for art history and studio first she is inexplicably angry at our generation unjustly offended by technology constantly accusing the class of not caring convinced that her work in unappreciated in studio she will always have something negative to say hardly anything positive expects the world out of her students
5.0,W,i took ms hamptons hybrid art class the class was very tough challenging however i came to college to learn even if it was a subject out of my comfort zone i learned to appreciate art as i never did before her class ms hampton is abrupt and to the point however i loved her be prepared to work hard your grade come for free
1.0,W,do not take math with this teacher she is very rude talks to you like your stupid if you have any questions never responds to emails and really doesnt care if you pass or fail
1.0,W,she is horrible never answer email and horrible at explaining not a good teacher to take
1.5,W,powers through lectures horrible at explaining how or why things work very picky about how she wants answers written and usually tell you ahead of time how she wants it written a bit critical basically reads the book off and lets class fend for itself
5.0,W,love mrs mcvey took her for math classes she was amazing and caring and helpful a really great teacher
4.5,W,mrs mcvey is an excellent instructor she does keep it moving to stay on schedule but she explains everything step by step she leave anything out she is very willing to help you and informs you of all of your resources she wants you to do good and has a good sense of humor will answer any questions enjoyed her class
5.0,M,mr harville is wonderful i took his math online and have a avg so far the class work is easy no complaints
5.0,M,i took his online class during the summer he was very lenient if i could not get past a section by his due date he would give me some extra time also he would give me options to get help section i think was the hardest but just pass that and it gets easier make sure you do the notebook he does collect those
1.5,M,not an excellent teacher do a very good job of explaining the material required homework and quizzes are all online his due dates change at random things will be due when they even been discussed in class nice man but i recommend him
3.5,W,great teacher she cares about your grades and always makes sure you understand the material
4.5,W,this is one of the most helpful math teachers that i have ever had for a class she goes out of her way to help you out and usually responds very quickly to emailed questions even over the weekend if math is intimidating this is the right teacher to help you learn and understand it
5.0,W,this was the second time i had taken college algebra previously i had scored a c with prof fenton i recieved an a i really enjoyed her class she took the time to explain things well and she had patience with everyone in the class
4.0,W,i had fenton for math it was basically the online class with class time we did everything online never used my book so just get the online code i do not struggle in math so i did fine i know others that really did struggle and she really helped them a little socially awkward but still nice i would take her again
3.0,W,i am actually good at math so i did not struggle in this class i did my assignments and that was all i had to do never had to study i know others that struggled and she really worked with them so they would understand and make a good grade her social skills are a little off but she is really nice i would take her again
4.5,M,was great the class is was easy test are not easy you have to read overall he is a great teacher
4.0,M,i took him online this summer his tests are crazy hard and some of the questions i find in the book nor on google after the exam i received and on tests but aced the homework assignments they take forever to finish but the more detailed you are the better your grade post often on discussion boards i still got an a
4.0,W,absolutely wonderful she can be slightly vague at times but mostly gets the point across i like that she is thorough with her marking
4.5,W,she is just amazing very nice person and great to look at too i use to attend her class just to see her had her for media story telling class and it was great fun
1.5,W,her guidelines for assignments match how she marks papers have any powerpoint presentations because all she does is talk we go to an art school we learn visually how do you not have visuals for take her class ever again
4.5,M,passionate about teaching willing to help and he cares about students and denison as a community some might call him unclear but just the nature of his class there to make you think and help you make connections if you understand his off-beat sense of humor realize actually a hilarious guy highly recommended
3.5,M,dr g is a very funny and approachable guy he is interesting in his lecture but it is very hard to follow what he is saying sometimes he is kind of scattered in his lecture and it is hard to remember everything from lecture sometimes you find the book more interesting than his lectures
3.5,M,dr gongaware is a really nice and funny guy swears a lot which can be entertaining however his lectures drag on forever and seem scatterbrained at times no offense to him but i learned more from reading the textbook than listening in class i found him hard to pay attention to a lot of the time and he can be unclear about assignments
5.0,M,awesome guy very easy to listen to drops quite a few f bombs which always spices the discussion up tests are online and papers bad take him if you can
4.5,M,he was so awesome and funny he really opened my eyes to sociology and how incredibly interesting it is he has an awesome sense of humor and is a very real guy he class is really easy and he never takes attendance definitely take him for soc
5.0,W,dr jasken is one of my favorite professors at mcdaniel she definitely cares about her students wants them to succeed she expects a lot as far as class work goes but work that is worthwhile can be applied in the real world--not just silly reading assignments here and there i wish i taken more classes with her great
2.0,W,assignments great teacher not so great always spaced out absent-minded and very vague breaks students project a lot never let her touch ur project her assignments are interesting to do but she give u any advice very id-oriented class which i enjoy that much
5.0,W,the material for the class is hard but dr jackson is super helpful and knowledgeable she does everything in her power to help you out would definitely recommend her
5.0,M,great teacher very nice and helpful all you have to do is follow the syllabus and study the rocks and you should do great in his class
5.0,M,he is such a kind man he cares about his students and will help you if you ask he grades really easy and will give you a good grade if you try hard he makes it interesting and there is very little homework
5.0,M,bob is fabulous he helps people when they need help if you are worried he will reassure you that everything will all work out in the end he teaches you not to give up on yourself and to remember that you can do this work all you have got to do is try and take bob
3.5,M,bob is great at what he does i would ask him questions after class and seemed to get better feedback from him he was always reachable by cell phone or email and always kept communication open it is hard to maintain an a because there is no extra credit and your grade is based solely on exams stay on top of work and practice problems
2.0,M,he is mean does not give extra credit or give any credit for homework your grade depends on three exams and the final exam its hard to pass if you arent already fluent in algebra he doesnt explain much he gets mad when we ask him to go over problems many students in my class dropped the recommend this teache
4.0,M,i loved this teacher the material is hard but explain it times if needed regular attendance is vital as tests comes from lectures quirky fun take him for lab as well textbook not needed but very helpful on a side note he looks talks acts just like a young matthew broderick watch the movie godzilla and see
5.0,M,i absoultely loved this teacher if you are horrible at science take chris beals he is amazing he looks like harry potter he helped me understand so many things that i never understood in other science classes he talks to you like a student not a teacher he wants everyone to get an a and gives you extra points and extra credit great guy
4.5,M,great and very helpful dry sense of humor but when he gets down to business he demands respect when talking
3.5,M,i took frank for and he is a great teacher very helpful and understanding this class isnt easy but if you show up and show effort you should pass make sure to go to his test review classes they are very helpful definately recommend this teacher over all the others i recieved an a and and b in
5.0,M,i took lecture online and lab on campus lecture test are not the easiest alot of fill in the blanks lab was super easy i like mr mann and i will take him again he gives you alot of bonus points as well so if you do bomb a test you have a chance to make it up this class has alot of homework but not to hard
4.5,M,do the study guide that is the test fill it out and memorize it and get an a anyone saying otherwise is ridiculous and study very very possible to get an a in this class you use the book at all i had him for a and p and and micro got in all study
4.0,M,i enjoyed a lot of the material it is a discussion based class and it can be fun although i had a dissenting opinion once and i felt a little disrespected by d i got over it and he hold it against me i think we did a lot of writing because it was little pieces every class period and not a lot of big papers good class overall
5.0,M,the class the most interesting but d is great really funny and nice and loves what doing expect a lot of reading participation in class and attendance is key he just wants you to have an opinion and about what discussing
5.0,M,he will do everything to help you with anything he is a super nice and funny guy
1.0,W,terrible teacher will not let you redo anything she has a weird grading system so good luck making an a in her class i will not ever take her again for another class
4.5,W,there is a ton of reading involved in this class the teacher is helpful and good about returning emails and calls the assignments are not that bad but the tests are horrible she offers extra credit for pop quizzes over each will help your overall grade
2.0,W,it would be nice if she be so relentless about the documents and the grammar i understand your intent but this is a typing class not an english class if you wanna teach english maybe you should go back to school t moore maybe then get what like i hope you have a teacher just like you maybe then change
3.0,M,super nice guy and really enjoyed teaching but i honestly would not recommend him if you are taking more than one class he gives a rediculous amnt of hmwk and runs through the math for someone that had math or chem in a while way too difficult to understand
5.0,M,i took his gen chem class as a week summer course he is hands down my favorite instructor had i consider him a lifelong contact and i learned so much from him incredibly easy to talk to about his class your goals your education this man cares about his students chemistry easy so be willing to try and do just fine
3.5,M,while he is a smart professor he is very difficult to understand he review with us over our material but will tell us to just study over the chapters instead i personally take him again as some of the other professors were much easier to work with for assistance
3.5,M,i took neilan for fundamentals of chemistry and he is an incredibly helpful teacher but a lot of his exams are extremely tricky be prepared to study enough a few days before the exam to fully comprehend the material on the bright side he is extremely nice laid back and approachable for any questions you have he does what he can to help
2.5,M,he is a good professor if you go to his class everyday and ask questions i went to his tutor classes and those did not help me his tests you really need to study for and you never really know what is going to be on them a lot of them seem like trick questions
5.0,M,i loved his class this class was my first chemistry class ever he made it a great experience he is very helpful if you understand the material he will help you pay attention take lots of notes ask questions read the material take notes and do the homework he gives extra credit during the semester so do it great professor
2.5,M,nice guy very smart but should not teach he knows chemistry but he teaches like he is at yale and is crazy hard to understand and when you get your test back it looks like it has been through battle with all of the red on it i have nothing against him like i said he is extremely smart just cant teach or relate his knowledge to students
4.5,M,dr neilan is a fantastic teacher and anyone who disagrees care about putting forth effort organic is a hard class but he will do what it takes to make sure you get it he truly cares about his students as well and takes time to let you know he appreciates your hard work funny helpful and his class has been a wonderful experience
5.0,M,awesome professor very clear lectures understands students and goes out of his way to help answers questions and helps with assignments if you go to his office hours
5.0,M,professor rysdahl is a great professor takes a subject most dont care about and brings it to the maximum of relevance got on easiness cause of material not him take him learn so much in his class
2.5,W,i had her from lab the first day or so it was hard to understand her she does yell when she talks and is hard to read she grades hard on her labs but if you copy the problems word for word you will get a on them all do not miss a lab if you intend to pass
2.5,M,great guy if you a smart ass get along with him just fine
2.0,M,he doesnt not teach at all all he does is give speeches and they are due the next class meeting
3.0,M,i did well i do not even know if he has a text book but he will give test on it test the test are the same amount of points as the speeches he will explain the speeches but the test you are on your own
4.0,M,i was dreading taking this class but mr jobe makes it easy he explains what he wants out of a speech but other than that he lets students be as open as they want to be it was very entertaining i learned a lot through my peers and material i did speeches on make sure you come to class and act like you have some will be an a
5.0,M,loved him he is a huge county guy and he is probably one of the most silliest guys in the world his class was more like high school eveyone got to know one another and him as well loved the atmosphere but the test are kinda hard he is for sure a great teacher
5.0,W,i had her for college success she is a great professor she cares about her students she does give a lot of busy work but it is not hard we had to give or presentations during the semester all quizzes were open book i enjoyed this class got an a
5.0,M,mcmcdonald was a great teacher he wanted you to succeed and was extremely helpful i am an adult student and struggle in math and he never made me feel like i do it take him for all of my math classes if i could i had to drop at the end of the semester due to other issues and will take him again if he is teaching
5.0,M,he is so great he comes off as harsh at first after a few class days one will notice that he is a fantastic instructor that really cares about his students many of his assignments are easy and fun
4.5,M,he is definitely not easy so if you are looking for a bird class do not take his class however if you are interested in learning the fundamentals so that you can write college level papers i strongly recommend him he seems harsh at first but the more you get to know him and joke with him the better the experience will be for you
2.5,M,strict and follow his own syllabus rules very thick accent and yells at students like we are stupid little children overstates obvious things like we comprehend
5.0,W,judy is very clear about what she expects if you do the work which very hard as long as you pay attention you will do well she is very sweet and the classes were decent to sit through if i were a thar major take more classes from her
5.0,W,she is awesome
3.5,M,took his freshman seminar class and found it quite interesting this was a pass fail class so it hard but he was did talk a lot about his life but it was interesting to me
3.0,W,she is sweet but so hard to pay attention to tests are difficult even with a study guide i studied hard for every one but never made an passes around a sign in sheet every day lots of opportunities for bonus points it could be better but it could be worse
4.5,W,very sweet class is terribly boring but she does pass around a sign in sheet almost every day tests hard but they easy and you do get a study guide she is very smart and passionate about her subject
4.5,W,shes very knowledgeable about her chosen subjects attendance isnt necessary tests are easy the classes are dry and boring but incredibly informative she talks you a good grade easy as that
4.5,M,hale is a wonderful professor grading is fair he might come off as mean but he is not at all he makes class enjoyable with his stories
5.0,M,great professor the reason why i switched my major to bms i call him easy but he makes the class interesting so you will want to pay attention if you can definitely take him
5.0,M,he is such great teacher very strong science background very helpfull he is extremely clear in explain the material i had him for low level class but i wish to had for a higher one but he is the best he is the king of sciences

3.0,W,i never heard a satisfactory syllogism or argument on any topic outside of her lectures and i still doubt that her phenomenology course would score very highly in the perception class over at psychology i been able to subscribe to this big money course in advanced tautology which is way too abstract for me to handle

4.5,M,professor fogel is simply the greatest he is so incredibly knowledgeable but not intimidating at all he is super-helpful during office hours and in e-mails and is always willing to meet with students even if it means coming outside his office hours he is tough but so open to hearing other students ideas so glad i took his class
3.5,M,professor fogel is my favorite so interesting and funny also sort of an old hipster prof which is kind of funny at first i was thinking about switching out of his class because he mumbled so much and acted so nervous on the first day but glad i did it his grading too hard and the reading is pretty light take his class
4.0,M,such an insightful hilarious man at first i was put off my his mumbling ways but trust me once you get to know him all his interests manners tastes asides and honest skill as a professor become entirely endearing helped me to look at poetry in a new way
5.0,W,dr perdue is a real person very honest and interested in making sure you understand that life outside the classroom gum drops and lollipops i love her grit and her approachability she gives many first hand examples and her laugh may startle you but she is fabulous a very very smart professor

5.0,M,he is explains things thoroughly he uses example in real life and he makes it interesting
2.0,M,jerry is a very nice guy outside of class but two or three times he singled out students during lecture seemingly for the sole purpose of assuming they had made a stupid mistake for the sake of discussion his organization was poor and i think he has somehow gained a monopoly over this course others could teach it far better
2.0,M,been years since i took calc with this professor and i still avoid him on campus never has a professor made me feel so low and stupid and i even think he knew my name i used to love row student now

5.0,W,a math expert with a positive attitude very informative and willing to stay after class to help students be in class everyday for her lectures because she makes the lessons simple to understand than reading over the textbook the class can be a challenge with number of quizzes and homework to complete but tests are the killers so study daily
5.0,W,i was having a hard time with math but she really heped me understand she dedicates extra time to those students who are having a hard time
4.0,W,she is a pretty good professor she is very helpful and cancels class a lot when she does have class you mostly sit around and talk because she is very laid back

1.0,M,professor is useless his test r essays which in my opinion are he grades on his oponion not the facts tests are all from his lectures and power points which are horrible he forgets what talking about half the time and relies on is assistant
1.5,M,his tests are based on his lectures not the textbook he let you record lectures his grading is harsh end up working thrice as hard as you would for another history class so unless in love with history and are a part time student take his class your gpa will suffer i got a b and i worked harder on this than math

5.0,W,take her class you will not regret it

3.0,M,gao is nice enough but the class seemed a bit disorganized no schedule or class assignments listed ahead of time the book sucks and is chock full of errors despite this i did well in the class ignore laugh or statements of how easy everything is he will help you during office hours and is usually pretty good in clarifying concepts
5.0,W,women religion and spirituality was one of the best classes i took my freshman year she is very sweet and insanely intelligent the classes include almost exclussively women but she really cultivated an interest in the subject for those not expecting to like it this is a great gen ed to take to fulfill your csi and global diversity flagsl
4.5,W,she was a very good and a kind teacher she used to communicate with the students very well and is a good teacher to take for any psychology courses

5.0,M,was always scared to take a hour class but joe makes the time fly he has interesting to engage with his students and encourage their intellect random quizzes help to refresh material but he is very helpful that he gives you wonderful study outlines only bummer is that he was too nice rude students cell phones always going off
5.0,M,great class very thorough teaching if you attend class you will do well not too bad on the eyes as well his personality is great and very helpful take him
3.0,M,grade is made up of quizzes midterm and quizzes usually questions and you only have seconds to answer before he moves on i read and understood all chapters and sections and worked problems at the end of the book never failed a class if not doing well place false hope in the final i failed bad
3.5,M,dr chambers is a good professor but you have to work really hard in his class you must go to class to understand the topics he wants you to know then take his information and spend a lot of time researching and learning it yourself the final is extremely difficult but if you kept up during the class and studied really hard you can do well
4.5,W,she was an absolutely amazing professor i really loved her she just had so much positive energy and such a great attitude she made me appreciate theatre if you have any chance to have her do it you regret it very easy and fun too i miss her as a professor
1.0,M,please do yourself a favor and do not take this class over half the class has complained to the university they do nothing because the man is on tenure by far the worst professor in ct perhaps the us i am passing along with a few others only because taken acc classes before he spends of class telling stories avoid at all costs
2.5,M,the whole semester i was struggling basically teaching myself with the book he calls the book dumb but uses it for everything if you go to every class and take good notes he will look at the end of semester and note your good note taking i was surprised to get a b thought i failed
4.0,M,if you read you will pass then tests are a piece of cake and if you need help is always open to your questions he has alot of patience great professor
5.0,M,i will admit prof burbank is a difficult grader but i appreciate the high standard and always find myself working harder for difficult graders i have taken numerous courses from burbank and easily he is one professor i greatly admire and respect certainly learned a lot from him
2.0,W,a ruthless grader study groups are your best bet but even then expect to score a lower grade than usual she has no problem failing most of the class ewa tends to throw questions out of left field and often it seems that there is an excess of overlap between questions i do not recommend ewa wasilewska
4.5,M,he challenges his students and tries to get students to go beyond what was written in the case and think about the larger concepts surrounding contract law clearly explains complicated topics not an easy marker but not impossible
5.0,W,omg best teacher ever i was a complete noob before i took her yoga and zumba classes and i was hooked ever since really funny and points out the postures to everyone she make me feel bad for being a fatty and she recognizes good effort
2.5,W,she only likes the people who know what doing and if you do it right after two weeks she makes you feel like an idiot i liked what she was teaching but a bit arrogant about it beginners beware
5.0,M,prof wernli is an awesome professor if you are looking for an easy a you find it in a fair professor but you still have to earn your grade attend class study the notes he gives read the book and have no problem earning that a plus very helpful and willing to answer your questions
4.0,M,he is easy prof compare to my previous one have quiz subjects on his web before quiz tests were little hard but i guess write down his lecture overall good teacher
5.0,M,omg this professor is amazng everyone should take him although his tests are a little hard with studying you should come out with a c or higher but dont think that you can get by without even trying a little wernli makes you laugh and loves biology a honest to good man who loves to help his students i recommend him anytime
5.0,M,prof wernli makes it really hard to make a bad grade in his class very clear on what will be on his exams and gives many quizzes of which he keeps only the top grades he will bend over backwards to help you if you just ask attend class and study i made an a very nice man sweet and young at heart
4.5,M,he is awesome strict but if you do the work you will get the grade he is very helpful pay attention to the powerpoints and notes know the material backwards and foreward for your own benefit
4.5,M,he is such a nice to help in learning fun with his jokes and also gives you tricks on how to learn most of the up power points and drops a lot of low grades keeps top quizzes totally teacher
4.5,M,alls you have to do is study and go to class because if you miss it throws off the rythim you where in he is a great teacher really funny and very helpful i am so glad i signed up for his course
2.0,M,he is the worst teacher i did not learn a single thing in this class do not take him sonoma should fire him
4.5,M,if you care about learning but want an a take this class he is super nice you dont have to go to class you can turn in late homework and re take test as many times as you want
1.0,M,easy class and stuff can be made up but he has to be the hardest to understand teacher ever had in my life he never answers any questions clearly and constantly mumbles never used the book
3.5,W,her teaching style was consistent with my own personality i prefer to be guided to my own understanding of a subject as opposed to hand-held on every concept i suggest her if you are a student with a good deal of self-drive if not you should try to find another professor
2.0,W,she is amusing and sweet but the class was extremely hard she had such a confusing way of explaining the material i would never want to have her as my professor again
2.0,M,i would not recommend this professor he makes a history class turn into only thinking about energy flow he makes things so hard to understand most of the time i had no idea what he was talking about be prepared to teach yourself the material this is not a traditional history class my worst class
3.5,M,charasmatic yes interesting yes most definitely in my opinion though exactly what makes this class worth taking very important to keep up with reading attending discussion sections and also asking him talking with him after class professor that truly cares
2.5,M,this man is a lunatic he managed to turn a history class into a literature course i left his class with less knowledge about the world than when i went into it he does care about his students however he has one teaching style and that is it so if you are not on the same wavelength as him prepare to be left in the dark
4.5,M,a good professor super easy and nice i would recommend him for child psych attendance is not mandatory but if you miss he does not put the slides on blackboard so it is recommended you go plus find yourself wanted to go to class
5.0,M,by far the best professor i have ever had he made the class so much fun and interesting the tests are pretty easy all you need is to read the book and study the notes and you will do really well
5.0,M,favorite professor soooo funny i would never miss a day because he makes class so interesting take him
4.0,M,hupp is an amazing teacher he is very interactive and loves what he does his power points are very easy to understand as long as you attend class when he goes over them test are easy and over what he has talked about attendance is not mandatory but he doesnt put the power points on blackboard
2.5,M,do not take him if you want to learn something i got nothing out of his lectures was a waste of my money and time
3.5,M,goes off on long anecdotes clearly knows the material but seems to sometimes have a hard time actually explaining the concepts tests are brutal absolutely brutal are a good grade buffer though overall would recommend him if you want to learn but not if you want an a
1.0,M,this teacher is honestly the worst teacher i have ever had in philosophy you are allowed to have an opinion but not in his class this class is full of work that has nothing to do with philosophy it has hurt me in other classes because i spend so much time on his homework that is busy work i pretty sure i got an a in his class
1.0,M,this man is not an educator his concern with his students and work ethic reflect a close minded individual awful time and worst way to start a year at college if you take this class then you might as well drop it and try to get someone else
1.0,M,absolute worst teacher at sonoma state do not take a class with him unless you want your semester ruined
1.5,M,worst professor i could have ever imagined having do not take his class
1.0,M,very hypocritical teaches a class that should teach open mindedness but yet he is the most close minded person i have met in his class there are two types of opinions his and the wrong ones i would say the class is online yet he is incompetent at with moodle the class website himself if you get him good luck
1.0,M,ridiculous amount of work assigned at the time work assigned had nothing to do with philosophy looking back i can see how he tried to connect it but failed tries to be a good teacher but he just explain things well i suggest you take this class
1.0,M,worst teacher of my life do not take him this class had nothing to do with philosophy and there is so much work it is ridiculous you will be saving yourself so much stress if you do not take him
2.0,M,the amount of work he gives is ridiculous i was doing way more homework then my other friends who had a different phil teacher however i managed to get all of my work done and ended up with an a the work difficult it is just very very time also learned nothing about creative thinking choose a different professor
4.0,M,smartest professor at um he is extremely detailed because in addition to being a genius he was actually a partner at cravath so he practice experience he likes you to be exact and sometimes he goes really deep into problems that be on the exam he an easy grader either hilarious and makes you think hard cool guy to talk to
4.0,W,professor chase is very enthusiastic she loves physics her constant nodding and running across the room kept me thoroughly entertained i learned a great amount in this class
3.0,M,dr kelley is a great professor his class requires much textbook reading old exam studying even if trying hard but are doing poorly fear not you will make it out alive my test average was a in orgo ii i think i did a little better on the final i got a d if that puts anything into perspective happy studying
3.5,M,view lessons online as needed to learn the material because as previously commented he simply goes through powerpoint but it does appear that the powerpoint is designed by him to accomplish course objectives project is huge so make sure you get a responsible group after this class i was definitely more interested in databases
4.5,M,super laid back pretty simple class read take quiz some papers a group presentation at the end the the final paper very nice man i would definately recomend him and this class easy ge
2.5,M,very really likes it when you participate in class be confusing when giving instructions for really make you think but a hard grader but read the assigned readings because he does ask questions
5.0,M,i have read with utter disappointment the shallow misguided ignorant rants against one of the best teachers i ever had and i studied with some big names he prepared me for a successful career earns the respect of seasoned professionals and his shows are among the best and he has help shape some of the best-they come back to work with him
1.5,M,i thought he was a chicano studies professor i think he should stay there he know enough about history to be teaching it
5.0,M,best professor so helpful knows his material makes class fun and project fun not hard at all and his lectures are great you will learn from him easy a
5.0,M,awesome professor you will learn in this class and you well love his class midterms and finals are take homes

5.0,M,take music theory with dr roter he is a great teacher and as long as you pay attention in class you will do fine he keeps the class interesting and you will learn a lot
5.0,M,avdulov is a fantastic professor if you put in the effort and are dedicated to improving he will do anything to help you reach your goals however if you skip classes or slack off you will get no love from him those who left comments about rudeness were likely in this category work hard and take it seriously and class will be great
3.5,M,expect a bird course from him pay attention when he says something will be on the test write down everything that sounds like a key term and take an interest in the course notice and go above and beyond for you short with people who deserve it be a lazy student in his class especially introductory japanese
4.5,M,great prof however he is a stickler for marking this was however an english course so i can hardly blame him over all he was extremely helpful and kept every class interesting
4.5,M,he is helpful but picky when it comes to marking tries to keep class interesting overall he was a great teacher and i enjoyed his class
4.0,W,took acc over the summer online totally thought i was going to fail because i failed every test but the last one but i still got a c if you do the online homework and study the notes its possible to do better apparently she said she curved the grades good thing
3.5,W,i would recommend going to class the material necessarliy hard but the exam review guides are vague and pretty much include everything the sua is time consuming but if you double check with a group for each part you should be fine she is very nice and knowledgable about the profession and what employers look for
4.5,M,he makes con law interesting and loves the subject a rare ability to take a subject that he knows about and translate for those who at his level if only more british profs were like him
2.5,M,this professor was a little degrading to his students but none-the-less he was very knowledgable about the subject there was hardly any homework and the tests were manageable as long as you attended lecture labs let out early often so over-all i would say he was a decent professor if you need to get this class out of the way
4.0,M,love him must take before you graduate no one cares more about his students than les
5.0,M,absolutely the best not only has he written on just about every legal topic imaginable but he can explain it very clearly as well also extremely accommodating whether going over material outside of the classroom or helping plan your schedule i took classes i had no interest in just so i could take him for a teacher it was worth it
5.0,M,my favorite professor i had him for and crimproi and thorough witty helpful and knowledgeable exams are difficult but his office hours are excellent and he will give you supplements if you need them to prepare he hates unprepared students so do your reading and use office hours
4.0,W,i loved her class it was very easy to get an you do your class assignments and study it wont be hard at all to get an a there are tons of extra credit assignments i recommend prof perry
4.5,W,really loved this class a great prof gives a lot of helpful advice for future teachers she always gave back papers tests she does a lot of group work but it definitely helps take a chance and take her
1.5,W,this professor is seriously the most disorganized teacher at citrus she misplaces work doesnt respond to emails and shows preference between students if you are going to take her save a copy of all of your work
2.5,W,i am in her class it is the middle of the week and we still received our yet but we are still expected to turn it in by the same deadline i am really disappointed with this teacher because how are we expected to do good when you short us on our time to complete assignments so frustrated with her
3.0,M,expects a lot from his choir which is not a degree you can get here he expect you to practice he wants the best from a student which sometimes he sounds rude sometimes racial to prove a point forget to go to class you get downgraded if you miss classes
5.0,W,i wish all professors were like style of teaching is person overall take her class you will not regret it
5.0,W,greatest professor i have ever had i wish she would teach all my classes her shoe of teaching is awesome you will learn a lot like i did as a person really bad with technology take her class and your life will be changed
4.5,M,he is my favorite teacher one homework assignment is due before each class it takes about an hour if focused we watch videos and do interactive science activities online for lots of the homework assignments i think anybody makes science as fun as he does attending class is important for quizzes you find a better teacher
2.0,M,the class was fairly easy but the tests were very poorly written it seems to me like he tries to trick you he required a textbook that was only on amazon and we only ud it twice and there were hardly any questions over the reading in the text book i felt like he prepared for class because the class time was not over the prep assignments
4.5,M,fairly good teacher i enjoyed his classes expect to do homework for each class and trust your original quiz score not only are his multiple choice tests difficult all of the above but he makes the test the day before you take it and fixes any errors after you take it overall nice teacher fairly difficult class
4.0,M,i really enjoyed taking brother class the homework was not hard mostly busy work doing the homework and attending the test prep sessions really helped me on the tests he is helpful and willing to meet after class if you have any questions
5.0,W,prof katty is great currently having her i do not know why people complain genetic is a challenging subject work hard read the textbook and you willbe ok she has a good knowledge of the subject i do not blame the prof for poor grade but the effort u get what you put in i recommand katty but be prepare to work hard read the texbook
1.0,W,i love genetics but am very disappoinetd with this class and professor her lectures are based on pictures taken from text book she will read the captions word for word out of the book she explain anyhting lots of homework problems not covered in class or recitation and on exams how is that acceptable worst prof so far
4.5,M,knows what he is talking about since he is the head of the department kind of acts like he is all knowledgeable but you eventually understand that he is just good at what he does take him if you want to actually learn something instead of just going through the motions
1.5,W,horrible teacher with no plans at all she takes attendance at the beginning of class and also after break and she gives points for attendance but not the problem never clear on anything you will be in the dark the entire course she makes you watch old movies that has nothing to do with the course or tests however homework was easy
4.0,W,pretty easy class she takes attendance right at the start of class easy grader and gives extra credit show up to class and take good notes and you will get a good grade class is very boring but she knows art very well got an a in this class
4.5,M,kibbles is the man he does make you do a lot of homework which is extremely taxing but is also really clear in lecture if you wake up each day at to listen to him talk you should be fine
4.5,W,kristine is extremely invested in what you take out of her class and i really enjoyed the class much more then i expected to considering i am not a communications major definitely take a class from her if you can
4.5,W,she is a very nice and helpful teacher although this class is ridiculous the test are hard because it is all memorization and you know what will be on the tests i would like this class better if it so hard very relaxed class you get a lot of good input from this class with cool art projects class stunk but good outcome
4.0,W,it was a pleasure taking the summer class with ms brown she challenged us to learn and identified areas of curriculum that was of importance it was good to know the teacher give us everything and allowed us to learn outside the classroom and encouraged open lab along with the apr online learning tool thank you ms brown enjoyed it
2.0,W,is a sweet person and is willing to help when you understand but her notes are horrible you basically have to take your own notes and really study outsid eof the class if you want to pass her tests are pretty fair and she always includes extra credit
1.5,M,sure he grades really easy but unless if you already taken a calculus class you will be lost every single lecture because he skips steps and explain what doing if you can study a lot and learn on your own then take him because of his easy grading people who say the best ever must already know calculus
4.5,M,this is the best math professor i have had he is by far the easiest grader i have ever seen with that being said make sure you practice and do problems put in the effort and you will get an a
5.0,M,one of the most well-taught classes taken it a bird course but his lectures are so interesting you are guaranteed a good mark if you show up and pay attention
5.0,M,pretty much the greatest teacher had so far at waterloo hilarious and makes you wanted to attend class definitely take as many courses with him as you can you regret it
3.5,W,an okay prof somehow simultaneously very reasonable and hopelessly out of touch with students push back a deadline but then not be clear what she wants from the assignment help if you ask for it but is also harder than other profs in that she assigns more work
5.0,W,she is very engaging and caring professor she has profound knowledge about and embryo development i would recommend taking her bio intro class
2.5,M,at times he can a bit too silly and forget that actually trying to prepare you for his tests
5.0,M,incredibly hard at first but becomes the most useful class anyone in the field could take the way he prepares his students for post grad life is ten times better than most of his colleagues in the fitzwater center not a bad thing to say about him and do not take anything personally
5.0,M,best teacher ever i have had him all four years and he has taught me a lot i have a great deal of respect for this man and i hope people will have the same experience i have had
4.0,M,nonviolent warrior had extremely boring lectures over explain things he will keep you the full hours and minutes
5.0,M,lectures are clear and interesting he is a good teacher and learn a lot grades just based on exams he likes to have us write papers and have discussions a nice break from lectures and exams on exams and papers he is extremely picky make sure your definitions are word for word and your writing is as concise as possible
1.5,M,kind of blah he teaches science and really thought more about his science classes then our math class felt stupid in this class felt stupid because of the teacher
5.0,M,he teaches science and is very knowledgeable in science and make class fun and the labs are fun also took both of my sciences with him get you to think
1.5,M,i didnt learn anything about math other then how to get frustrated just sad getting good gpa is imporntan to me and this class totally killed it not all teachers fault but i felt like i was board and very frustrated with gilles i felt he looked down on the math beginers people who didnt have a or first timers in college
5.0,W,dr brown was an incredible professor a little cray cray but i loved her all the same she really made class fun and her crazy comments always made me laugh definitely take her awesome
5.0,W,this teacher is the bomb she is easy you will just have to do a couple papers and her tests are also easy if you try really hard then u wasted ur time u can barely try and get a b or try a little bit and get an a shes is so easy to understand and she isnt boring take this teacher
5.0,W,she is the best professor i have had you can get her go for it
5.0,W,no joke an amazing teacher and really cares about her students take her trust all the comments
1.5,M,one of the absolute worst professors at uvu the class is hard and he makes it that much harder if he is your only option take it he brags about how hard test are avg on one test was on a class with over students and he said he was impressed that people had such a high average avoid at all costs
5.0,W,you can put your self in out ppl shoes and understand then your essays will be easy when she assigns you a wants to know and the gossip she wants the juicy stuff miss the books cuz that can be extra credit just having em
4.0,W,she is an amazing teacher as long as a good student not rocket science the subjects are not difficult you just need to actually put effort into it to get a good that how all college courses should be
3.0,W,you will learn a lot in this class i enjoyed reading the material and her lectures were very informative dont take this class if you want an easy a because you will not get one you must work for it
2.0,W,definitely one of the worst teachers had here she repeats herself and talks about herself the whole lecture the only way you learn is through your own hard work reading and the occasional film grading compared to content and lectures are very disproportional grade rides on tests and essay do it again
2.0,W,do not take her i took her because of the easy reviews however spring she took off suddenly to medical leave she misses class a lot so the school took action we got this new guy for a teacher who made the class quite difficult quizzes were more challenging as were the lengths of the essays a lot of the class did poorly on quizzes
1.0,W,she cancelled class frequently but ended up giving all of her students it was a bit scary to not have any idea what my grade looked like until the end of the semester but there was hardly any work in the class
2.0,W,spring incredibly easy lots of cancels skimmed the reading lecture was dry even when she tries to make it relatable with college kids in fact it gets near incomprehensible when she starts throwing in lingo that she perceives as current but what can you do when half the class looks like they even know how to write a decent paper
5.0,W,very passionate about astronomy if you have a question she will answer it in a way that is fun and easy to understand large homework assignments that she will guide you on how to do it a lot of calculations but it is gone over a lot before you do it on your own easy exams lots of extra credit opportunities
5.0,M,tjandra is really helpful to his student loved his class i have a really hard time with chemistry but mr tjandra made it so understanding and easy its not hard to pass his class if you do all the hw and exercises he gives you also you need to study overall his class is the best wish all science teachers were like him
5.0,M,he is such a sweetheart ha ha he really wants to help you guys succeed you can tell by his actions it is kind of adorable how he tries to tie in science jokes in class to ease everyone up and try to make things fun take it easy study frequently and do you homework if you miss those you will lose valuable points good luck
5.0,M,i had dr tjandra for chem and he is the best professor had ever he genuinely cares for his students and their success chemistry is a tough subject but he really tries and makes it understandable to his students do your homework carefully take careful notes and go to his office hours and do fine the best
4.5,M,dr tjandra is amazing he is so helpful and really wants the students to succeed he cares about what he does and furthermore he is super intelligent he really goes the extra mile for his students excellent choice
4.5,M,tjandra is an amazing teacher before taking his class i was so intimidated with chemistry tjandra really knows how to teach and offers as much help as you need to help you understand miss a class or hw and you will do well memorize everything he says to in the beginning and towards the end everything will just fall into place

4.0,M,exercise physio was an incredibly fascinating and relatable class that being said fisher is a very specific grader on free response questions and his multiple choice items very easy you can only miss questions on the entire test to get the lowest a something that is almost guaranteed to happen the material gets a hard class
3.0,M,fisher seems like an articulate personable guy and his lectures are interesting and simple to grasp that being said condescending in office hours and his tests never reflected the concepts he stressed in class definitely not the easy elective people make it out to be but probably the most interesting higher level biology class
5.0,W,i really enjoy her she is stern when it comes to being responsible and paying attention she makes it clear that she is not your mom and will not hold you hand you have to work for your grade and do the simple online assigned you need help or clarification she will give it to you also you must have a book of your own
5.0,M,i took classes years ago when he first came to ic i am back in college again after lo these many years and still teaching remains impactful his clarity passion and adventurous spirit along with his no modality of keeping things moving and challenging are even more valuable now as i look back best of the best this one
1.0,W,this was one of the worst teacher had we get off topic alot and if you agree with what she says she shows animosity towards can never make an a on any of her assignments and forgets everything that she says in the previous at all of her stale jokes unless end up failing her class because shes just vindictive
5.0,W,this lady does not have her head up her ass she is brilliant pay attention to the subtle and enjoy a fun class for a change

4.5,M,this guy is a hoot he seems kinda goofy but he is sharp argue with him unless sure of yourself on second thought do try and argue with him see do the work and keep up and no big deal
4.5,M,by far my favorite case professor very prone to tangents relating concepts to real-life problems when he first starts explaining a concept it seems a little circuitous but when he finishes his derivations crystal clear what he was going for absolutely brilliant and always loves talking to students in his spare time
5.0,W,took her online very easy class and as long as you participate you are golden the only problem i really had was the discussion boards because it seemed that she just gave you whatever she felt she wanted to at the time it worked out for me though she usually quick to respond if i had a question overall i say definitely take her
5.0,W,i took this class in the fall last year and i am looking forward to taking her online this fall she is awesome she genuinely cares about her students and is always available and willing to help

4.5,M,it is evident that he is smart in class but one-on-one--he is terrible obnoxious he does play favorites in class an instructor should never make a student feel stupid if we knew everything there would be no need to even take classes he has a huge attitude problem
4.0,M,i had langley for abnormal psychology and honestly its not hard if you do the work just make sure and study whatever he writes on the board show up for class and do your online assignments people who say this class is hard didnt put in the effort to pass because im a c or b student and i walked out with an a but never missed a class or assignment

5.0,W,this class is an easy a with that being said you do have to come to class you get points for being in class but that is the only way to get notes there are only test including the final i paper that is worth just as much as the test and a family shield she gives review sheets there is no way possible not to pass this class

4.0,M,great professor his classes made the topic very interesting even if not your tracktests are multiple-choice which i hate i learned a lot and the professor is a good grader too the only thing is that it may be a little bit challenging for foreign students because of his cultural references and new-york-centrism

1.0,M,he teach you besides his own crap that make any sense you must learn on your own with the textbook but must follow his own way of teaching he help you at all in the lab and claims that he has no office hours his questions are similar to the textbook on the midterm but the final is a diff case final say
1.0,M,he is crazy he wants to learn a chapter a week the midterm was six question for chapters and the final questions for to chapters if it is not done the format he wants it to be it is wrong no matter what please stay away any teacher is better than him trust me especially for pharmacy majors you will end up repeating it again
2.0,M,if you arent an encyclopedia of exact perfect mrchanisms catalytic cycles and structs you will loose millions of points for trite mistakes and not be rewarded in any way for what you have learned or put reasonable amounts of work and thought into given the choice i would never take a class from him again
1.5,W,assignments are ridiculously above soc level they are very unclear and constantly changing unbelieveably boring speaker rambles on about bizarre personal life if she says she will do soemthing she will not come through please would the faculty do something before she ruins more students interest in sociology
1.0,M,has no respect for anyone not a teacher but a clocker should do something else in his career awful professor exams are mc and tricky gives no partial credit stay away
5.0,W,this is a great class a year later i still remember everything i learned i had a four hour one day class with her and did not hate going you should deffinatly take her for english
5.0,W,she explains everything in great detail until everyone understands what it is they need to
4.0,W,i really like joan krone as a person she is nice and helpful she is not very good at structuring a class but the discussions we had were for the most part good good at letting students set their own agenda and independent study types of things
1.5,W,she is a very nice person and easy to talk to but is also very flighty and vague about her lessons she spent the entire class helping students who were either cs majors or knew way more than most of the students one of the books is written by her and is missing half the program for each program take this unless you plan to major in cs
4.5,M,the man will make you work for your grade however in the end if you do not know the information it is simply because you are not paying attention or reading the man laids things out for you so clearly that sometimes you wonder if you are truly doing the work he is that damn good you would enjoy his class
5.0,W,i loved her i have to agree with the person below me though she can be pretty rude at times class was a lot of fun
1.0,W,i am graduating this year and out of every professor i had she was the absolute worst she uses kate turbain style on papers that she said i would experience all therough college and what a surprise turns out she was the only teacher who ever asked me to use it she is way too hard expects way to much out of you for a gen ed class
5.0,W,prof teaugue is an excellant teacher in my opinion she loves the ancient times and is specialized in medieval wills the school changed the text book so she always sure of pages but is extremely helpful when you go to her with a question easy class if you do your and read
4.5,W,although she is challenging she is one of the better professors at ric tests are crazy hard and you have to be engaged in order to do well she is really intense about grammar and writing because she used to be a writing professor the papers are such a pain in the ass if you are looking for an easy ride slacker do not take her as a professor
3.5,W,somewhat condescending but definitely one of the best teachers there it might seem like she assigns a lot of work but none of the work she assigns is ever busy work which is more than i can say for other professors do all the work and get a high b or an a easy
1.5,W,yes if lazy definitely not the class for you even if not lazy honestly to be truly honest i would recommend finding another professor her lectures are very unenthusiastic and her tests are pretty hard like from a scale from definitely at least an
3.0,W,this is mos def not an easy a you really have to work your butt off i dont recommend her unless you have all the time in the world to study
4.5,M,i had him as a permasub the last month of class he saved the class from a bad teacher he went back and retaught everything making sure we knew the material accent that bad talks about math on a personal level instead of math terms if the grade on your final is better than your overall he gives you that grade nice guy approachable
4.0,M,i know what people are talking about prof grobstein is one of the best professors ever had in my life if you really want to learn something take his class he really makes you think critically about issues instead of taking them at face value how many teachers make you do that
5.0,M,i think this professor is great he knows a ton about the subject and arrogant he is helpful with writing problems and encourages students i highly reccomend him
1.0,M,all i can say is what an guy thinks that all his students should write like the writers for the new yorker the average grade in our class was a b and there was only two the guy has the personality of a box and is probably the most unfair grader in this college will learn more by staring at your belly-button lint
3.5,M,does not curve and he makes you study and know all the voc aks que every lesson also you will learn hebrew but a lot of work not easy but fair
4.0,M,he is a very nice professor and a nice person he is fair he really makes you learn i did not know hebrew at all and now i can speak understand a little read and write it is not easy at all but if you want to learn he is there for you if you ask questions on the tests he gives you answers
4.5,M,i had him for small groups what a great guy but boy is he boring as i know what he means well but you just want to pull the words out of his mouth it take him so long to say them i got an a he only gives a final and two easy papers
4.5,M,the class is lately he has decided to give a final pay attention because this is very important the final is serious read the book or at least the chapters that he tells you to if you want a good grade you need to do well on the final i was running an a in teh class and after the final ended witha b
5.0,M,professor snadowsky is a wonderful professor with many years of expierence he makes the class fun by getting everyone involved in the learning process i love him and i too wish he taught more courses he wants everyone to do well but take my word for for the class
5.0,M,a sweetheart and great professor i wish he taught more classes for register for them all definitely take this class for its a fun and memorable experience no tests papers basically about yourself it should be considered an education course as well as a psych for you have to basically do a lesson plan and teach the class
2.5,M,ok so attendence not manditory notes not worth much def mostly all about the txt book tests and optional paper tests with long questions and are confusing after the test u see what expect but def confusing nice guy but so boring goes on tangents i got a b im content cause his tests were confusing read the txtbook good luck
3.5,M,he is the nicest old guy he really is--but i got a b in the class--my lowest grade his quizzes are the trickiest things in the world-notes r completely useless-he expects u to memorize everythinggg in the chapter n will pull out random stuff that never expect to see the final was unbelievably hard nice guy but up to you honestly
1.0,M,this guy didnt even bother showing up to the final exam that shows how much he really cares about what happens on his final he may have been good but its time to retire rather then pretend to be teaching tricky questions on the final exam is not enjoyable not showing up for the final cause of little rain is pathetic avoid him
4.0,M,take note of every word that comes out of his mouth he would test you on it also read the text because he would test you on that also in all about multiple choice questions in hrs he gives credit for good attendance also other than that he is a nice professor very fair and to the point and the class is interesting
4.0,M,im taking him next semester for social that too much of brannon for one semester or will i survive
4.0,M,im not going to lie his tests werent easy but if you went to class and took decent notes you should get a pretty good grade the curve didnt help me much because i did good on the tests but if you do bad its a great help i recommend him
5.0,M,brannon is the best psych teacher he is clear passionate and extremely fair do not take this class if you are scared of working there is a ton of notes and readings but interesting psych majors do not miss out on any of the classes he offers
5.0,M,great its not to exciting the class because he just sits there and lectures but great and its easy to pass his class
3.0,M,brannon is a boring teacher you have to write down everything that he says it will be on the test what you read in the book is not discussed in class and will be on the test although he is hard he is a great teacher who gives great curves take him
4.0,M,this class was great-a lot of lecture was till the last minute of like pgs of notes a long as you take good notes and study you can do so well he puts a huge curve on every test you can do really well the tests are like over and some have like choices a-g but otherwise hes funny and its a good class
5.0,M,what a cool class i had a few good laughs and learned some fun facts he is way cool exams are long but nothing to stress over there should be more professors like him
3.5,M,the tests are long and include anything he may have mentioned in class and from the reading in addition each question has to choices however if sufficient notes are taken this class is not hard at all fall asleep or miss a lecture and a few questions on the test are not answerable

3.0,M,knew what he was talking about but understand the wording on some of his test questions i had the whole class on my side after explaining a question and listening to his reason for his answer but he would not listen he marked me wrong for a question that everyone knows i got right he just understand the meanings of some words
1.0,W,this is by far the worst class i have ever taken in bc because of this teacher a really interesting topic can truly be ruined by the teacher the only way to do decently is to read all chapters at least times which is ipossible she is so unclear and talks about everything other than the class subject run

3.5,M,he wants to cover too much stuff in this class because of this in addition to the lecture material you have to master the bones and muscles without a throrough review in class lecture was interesting and fun but the powerpoint slides arent descriptive and neither is the study guide suffice to say i read the book and used wikipedia alot

1.0,W,i had this woman as a substitute teacher in jr high and high school and she was even worse when given her own class she gave me a c on what was a b level paper simply due to the fact that she agree my opinions or those of my sources she feels that any opinion she share is wrong and possible in the realm of real world

2.0,W,it would take him the whole class time to work one problem seen him target the folks that may seem trouble makers he grabbed this girl by the arm and took her outside he thought she was being disrubtive but she was asking her neighbor a a good note he will let you make up his labs and sometimes get away homework
3.0,M,a great really blame him for doing so poorly on the final exam i agree with the previous comment you really need to know your stuff for the midterm exams as he does not tell you anything at all still one of the better had very energetic lectures making soil seem somewhat interesting goodluck if you have him

5.0,W,very understanding helpful and eager to teach many classes were cancelled this term due to various issues getting both her programs re-accredited and an unfortunate situation with her loved one no big deal read your chapters and be fine she simplifies everything if you pass this class you pass anyone
2.5,M,buy the book he never uses it if you like listening about his son great because all you are going to do it was an easy class but i care for him because all he talks about is himself and not on the test an easy class though
4.5,M,like they say easy class but what i liked most was the fact that he pushed us to be better people and actually apply what we learned into our life take if you want a challenge but take if you want to be a better person
2.0,M,prof nielsen while a good person did not teach well we hardly learned anything in class he seemed to not care about the class or what he taught it was not challenging at all despite the fact that it was an honors course i recommend him if you want an easy a but not if you want education
5.0,W,very best professor dr woolard is a true college professor and she really cares about your grade and you
5.0,M,awesome teacher---one of the best he actually has a degree in physics--unlike some other physics teachers at uv-high uvsc he explaines things very clearly i would highly recommend him
1.5,M,i found him very confusing the text book is huge and he explain the concepts very well if you can avoid him do
2.0,W,if you can take this course with someone else do so she takes herself too seriously the lectures are dry and boring
4.0,M,a really cool prof young and has kids so he knows what like to have a life outside of classes the textbook is useful but most of the testing materials come from the lectures he also tells you what is going to be on each test which are not cumulative
5.0,M,every moment spent in his classes was like staring directly into the face of god and having him stare back and say you are my most wonderous creation
2.5,M,very boring likes to walk as he talks and his facial expessions are histerical good info but hard to hear what he says
1.0,M,this was the most boring class i have ever taken at western i got the worst grade in this class i have ever gotten in college he has an interesting sense of humor but i think he is rude and it is very impossible to follow his lectures without falling asleep because is voice is monotone i go to class without falling asleep stay away
4.5,M,one of my favorite profs has a very dry sophisticated sense of humor an awesome lecturer each hour is well planned and information efficiently delivered he does make some funny grammar comments when handing tests else the brahmin priest offers a sacrifice on the altar the vet alters the puppy dog all in good fun
1.5,M,picks favorites biased made creepy jokes around me when i was alone with a girl uses the same slides for lectures over over i like him at all
5.0,W,therese is the best i highly recommend her to everyone as far as her being biased towards palestinians she presents a balanced view of middle eastern issues often exploring elements our traditional media ignores she is not the easiest but you will learn alot from her if you open your mind and think critically about the material presented
5.0,W,people say she is biased towards palestinians but are you kidding me thank goodness cause i see a lot of folks pulling for palestine in the in other regards a valient professor who keeps and open mind towards other views
2.5,W,exteremly biased against israel even though she claims to keep an open mind she presented one side of the struggle in the middle east and provided little voice for the other side to make its case this class does not present a fair academic look at this complicated situation
5.0,W,really good professor science my best subject but i did pretty well in this class she understands that many of her students bio majors and teaches the material in a way easy to understand there are tests and a final exam mostly multiple choice with or essays questions i definitely recommend her
5.0,W,really nice and understanding professor go see her if you ever need any help
2.5,W,she puts too much of a workload on her students and she even teach she has groups present and teach straight from the book hello who is the professor not to mention her grading scale is very steep you have to be a perfectionist to get an a you have no idea how she grades exams and what she looks for so good luck
4.0,W,a very nice and pleasant woman and easy to talk to her class can get a little boring at times too many group presentations it gets old fast and daily homework assignments but the subject was actually pretty interesting think comm theory would be boring but it is so applicable to real life that interesting to study
3.5,W,the class really difficult but she assigns a lot of homework and two group presentations throughout the semester which require a lot of work you can use your notes on tests all essay but she really tell you what looking for so grades can be hit and miss her grading scale is tougher than most an a is and above
1.0,M,dr wolfe basically read word for word from his notes most of the learning had to be done on your own attendance was you are the one paying for your class it should not be up to him if you show up or not the only person affected is you i showed the entire semester but it did not help me
5.0,M,great teacher i care what anyone says his exams are hard when came straight from high school where everyone is spoon-fed not hard when you take a couple hours to read and understand the material that what supposed to be doing anyway if majoring in biology
1.0,M,this class is very hard the professor just makes a power point from the book and reads it to the class the lecture is very broad and the test are very specific i would not recommend anyone to take his biology class it is worthless to do good in the class you have to read and understand every word in the book
1.0,M,the way that he teaches really does not help the students at all the only thing that he did was make a power point of the chapter in the book then read it off the screen there was really no explaining of the material that actually helped he hardly ever interacted with students either i could have learned as much by only looking at the book
4.5,M,maybe dr wolfe has changed this semester but i think incredibly clear in his lectures and his test are easy as long as you study hard for them taking credit hours this semester and i still managed to get a on his first exam take him learn a lot
2.0,M,yeah he is hot but he is a fresh college grad and thinks he is the stuff and thinks he knows everything and thinks we are graduate students or hard and to fast
3.0,M,worse professor i have had yet just reads the slides if you ask for explanation only makes you more confused and than spends half class talking about mushrooms tests are completely irrelevant to notes know how he comes up with some wuestions but he has a nice personality
3.0,W,be warned hartos has some very crude raw humor but i personally laughed like crazy every class she taught but the work is boring a tedious and she has a strict absence policy also no curve and half the time she sends her to teach for her but just give a little effort and an a or b is no problem
3.0,M,the thing is he does not grade fairly not a fan of partial credit not shocked anymore to see or on questions where i clearly have a half-decent grasp on it he is very picky and uncompromising i seriously had the feeling that he often want me to do well with any other prof that b would definitely be a solid a
5.0,M,feil is an excellent teacher though his tests are pretty tough he explains problems very clearly
4.0,M,john is by far the best professor had at northwest not like all the other english department teachers who bore you with pointless material that you even understand he makes the class fun and worth your time
4.5,M,he tries constantly to not make the class boring or like basic book classes he loves hearing student opinons because they give a different outlook to it i recommend it to anyone especially if you like taking boring regular literature classes
4.5,M,awsome and entertaining just stick to a certain schedule or course outline he tries to get you understand and likes to hear his students opinion on the literature
5.0,M,every northwest student should find a way to take a class with him at least once
1.0,M,i hope he reads this one day and knows that straight up the guy almost ruined my first year with all these professors trying to make u feel welcome here is dr stewart and his condescending remarks and attitude not a good person and not a good teacher i tried to tell him i was struggling he have cared less a real egomaniac and jer
1.5,M,i had dr stewart in an honours seminar a couple of years ago one of the worst professors that i had the misfortune of encountering at dal pompous egotistical inflexible and--unfortunately--not that good that being said if willing to follow his lead and you love critical theory probably be fine
3.0,M,not only is dr anthony stewart an unreasonable professor but the man is simply put a pompous ass he stalks over his lectures like some intellectual giant when in reality he is just another run-of-the-mill professor who takes himself too seriously his classes are always filled with racial overtones as well and constantly remind you he
5.0,M,awesome prof funny smart and kind really hard marker brutal exam but worth it because his lectures are great i skip once
2.5,M,i think eberts is really knowledgeable but not very approachable his tests arent bad but he doesnt really help you out at all with notes since he basically just talks about pictures i also dont like his comments about people leaving his class what if an emergency and why do you care its not your problem if they dont wanna learn
2.5,W,shes nice and tried to make class fun sometimes but pretty much didnt teach anything although she knows what shes talking about but didnt know how to teach pretty much had to teach ourselves calc wouldnt recommend

5.0,W,you can never appreciate deguchi until you have someone else she is always willing to help and the easiest theory techer here
3.0,W,the class isnt easy its a level course but when i took the class she seemed like she was a little confused herself on what to teach always seemed like a spontaneous class
3.5,M,not a very friendly professor but his class is extremely easy hard to stay awake during the lectures but take his class for an easy a
3.5,M,mcnorton tries hard to make a boring class fun he doesnt always answer questions clearly and sometimes doesnt even give you an answer at all but a very nice man
1.0,M,let me just say i took his class last semester not only was it one of the worst experiences of my life but even now one semester later i still run and hide when i see him on campus please waste your time or your sanity
1.0,M,the only reason why this teacher is still around is because he is married to the dean he told us we have a final exam then he slaps us with a final paper and a final exam that covered over pages of reading the class was ridiculously boring to the point of being hilarious seems like an easy a but it the class sucks
1.0,M,aaagh he is the college husband in that sense more part of the architecture than part of the curriculum sometimes i see him coming and i run away bother you pay lots of money to be here
5.0,W,she is one of the best professors that i ever had nice personality and very clear
1.5,W,she is very unclear but shes nice and if you beg her for a review she will give it to you read the book for the tests u dont need it for class she is so so boring tho she talks and talks and u probably will fall asleep easy course except for the tests
5.0,W,she is wonderful teacher
4.5,W,a very good teacher however her choice in course materials is severely lacking sweet and understanding she moves the class quickly which can be overwhelming at times fortunately the other two teachers move at a slower pace so it all balances out a good advisor too if looking for one
2.0,M,just tell him what he wants to hear he is not interested in your opinion he teaches same films over and over china town reel some film on cinematography sweet hereafter and eyes wide shut he will toot his own horn a lot since he edited the script for sweet hereafter fair marker didnt get a lot out of his classes
5.0,M,incredibly caring knowledgable fair unfairly labelled by students who listen his lectures are fascinating
4.0,M,i am not going to lie but in the beginig i hated this profeesor but if you hang in there he is not that bad he is the kind of professor who wants to test out the class who can hang trust me when i tell you at some points i felt like killing him in the end i recieved a a take too many classes with this course because this class is hard
1.0,M,i just dropped the course it was too stressful he grade fairly and always criticize the papers he yells insults and treat students as incompetents cannot email him and even try all he does it talk overall the class is boring but he persuades students to have a high level of critical thinking
1.0,M,worst prof had in my entire life heed the warning run your life he is awful does not provide u does not want be bothered he is totally confusing i have not learned anything in this course he does not want your input as to what u have learned he works off a book he and panzarella wrote together need i say more
1.0,M,this guy is a the class is very boring and the first two weeks all he does is yall at us he grades you papers and he believe anything is wrong with that overall stay clear from this and take anyother professor all he does all period is talk this is a clear and present danger warning take another prof
1.0,M,this man is a nutcase he is not clear as to what he wants even though he gives you pages to read trying to explain it when you follow the directions as he clearly explains it he still gives you a horrible grade he also emailed the whole class five times in the first weeks telling us all to drop the class get out i warned you
2.5,M,professor vona is a very hard teacher get out while you can and switch to professor hanson professor vona is very unclear and an unfair grader he follows a point system get out
4.5,M,took vona for org crime in amer on-line he seems very difficult but if you follow his instructions exactly as he wants the assignments done then do well missed assignments and discussions boards and got a b there is a lot of reading but it is a class
4.5,M,nice professor his tests are all and there are only total no other grades no final one really must attend class because some of his test questions come from random facts he mentions in class but not many an is an a so if you just pay attention you should do great and always read the i am section in the book not an overload
2.0,M,argue with him just believe what he tells you and write about it do fine
5.0,M,very nice and he possesses a subtle sense of humor so if you pay attention in class missing out care to read another reason you should pay attention in class well he gives three tests per term and many of the questions refer to seemingly random unimportant remarks he makes in class paying the
5.0,M,he is very nice and anything from an is an a
3.0,M,ok guy and an ok professor the class is great and since he is the only one that teaches it you really have no choice he knows what talking about and he tries to make it interesting if you get into it the class can be fun easy no matter what
4.0,W,great teacher you get homework but they hard and they actually help you get a quiz every friday but they hard and you need to study a lot for them she is very helpful i strongly recommend her
3.0,W,if u had four yrs of spanish in high school pretty much review from it packed into semester not too hard but a lot of unnecessary work out of class and most of the time work due next day usually isnt even discussed until some other random day when u prolly threw it away thinking she go over it u lose class participation
4.5,M,really nice guy class kind of drags on but he does frequently let you out early tough grader on papers you should easily get a b in his class
3.0,M,not bad for homework but tests suck the big one very controversial questions will give a little on some questions but others will not even if he is wrong probably look for another teacher
3.0,M,i looked up to him when i started my paralegal studies as time went i hated his class he was never wrong even when half the class proved it on a test also piss him off because drop you a whole letter grade just because he can nice guy if you like hitler
5.0,M,this professor gets your attention on what college is about if you go into any med or science field you need to take this guy he will prepare you for mcats vcats pcats i would highly recommend this guy if you are going this route or even nursing if you want a science for the hell of it take someone else i aced my bio part on my pcat
5.0,M,very professional instructor very knowledgeable on the topic that he teaches i strongly recommend him
3.5,W,typical writing of papers every week kind of interesting when she went off on tangents not her fault that critical reading is very high school i would take her again
1.0,M,his class was a waste of my life take someone else
4.0,M,this class was so easy as long as you paid attention in class and participates you will pass his lectures are boring and consist of like a billion slides which you dont have to pay attention to because they are online overall a very easy class
4.0,M,nice guy tries hard to make it interesting but still a snooze fest he does show plenty of little videos and commercials to break it up a bit test are straight forward and right out of class go to class and pay attention you got an a want someone to give you an a for being alive enroll at phoenix or ju
4.5,M,hes cool act like you want to learn something and you probably will test are online and he will help you through his project if you ask class can be slow but again participate and all is good
3.5,M,international marketing was horrible the project sucks it will consume your whole semester he is the only teacher for international marketing so have fun he is a tool in class but nice in his office
4.5,M,the class kind of drags on a bit the professor covers most everything on the test in class but you will have to study for his test do all the assigined work and study guides
4.0,M,class goes by a little slow but he is a nice guy his projects are very open ended but he is pretty helpful has a good sense of humor
1.0,W,she really teach she just goes over projection notes that made however she does give you copies of the notes which help when trying to study but in order to pass you have to pay some serious attention
2.5,M,very boring professor his exams are half essay half multiple choice his only classes seem to meet once a week avoid missing classes very poor time management with holidays we got to the final week with chapters of material left extremely difficult to get in touch with as well take schupp
5.0,W,wonderful teacher i would recommend her to anyone the project is the most important part of the grade so stay up on it she will help you in any way that she can she treats everyone the same and grades you by how hard you work anyone who says that dr wall is not a good teacher has a severe attitude problem
5.0,W,dont listen to the person who said she was bad dr wall is an excellent teacher who does everything in her power to make you understand what she is talking i could take dr wall for every class i would be very happy the class is awesome and its fun to boot take dr wall she rocks

5.0,W,took her for senior seminar and she was wonderful i learned so much from her and she is always willing to help
4.5,W,for intermediate fin shes solid knows her stuff goes at a good pace and exams are fair she preps you well for the exams
4.5,W,i had her for and and taking her for everything she says in class is clear and she gives real examples related from her work experience it is true that the exams were hard but it was hard for everyone even ppl who did not take her so just the way the profs make the exams and not way to teach
2.5,W,so i heard amazing things about this prof before taking the class but she was actually not that great i find that she was sometimes all over the place and not very organized also not very approachable the exams were not representative of the material learned in class and they were brutal especially the final still managed to get a good grade
5.0,M,prof cavaiola was one of my favorites i had him for crisis intervention and i was never bored his stories were always interesting and the material bad i wish i could take him for another class
1.0,M,taking theater at the college level is like going to kindergarten with a phd this professor makes no attempt to change this stigma he is more concerned with showing how good he thinks he is than teaching the basics of good performance this class does not prepare students for the vocal talent it takes to perform on stage
5.0,M,his classes were challenging and interesting if you show up and do the work you can earn a fair grade i felt inspired by his passion and dedication to the theatre when he is pleased or when he finds something interesting his face lights up
3.5,W,if she like how your writing style your grade will reflect that assumes all students are future journalists does not have much knowledge on how to effectively teach a class but knows a lot of real world journalism very nice though

5.0,W,top-notch professor brilliant and engaging a privilege to study under her
3.5,W,she is very passionate however hard to pay attention to she does not like differing opinions but she will not give you a bad mark based on disagreement you can expect to do a lot of work in her class essays a lot of readings for each class and a closing assignment she might be better in the morning than she is in the evening overall nice
1.0,M,kwag kwag in my year career as a student i have had perhaps one other teacher this bad this boring this hard to follow it is simple he should not be teaching period
4.5,M,his classes are tough i agree with other students opinions but he is very helpful for students to understand through individual tutoring during the class all students in my class had worries about him before taking classed but they has been changed after taking classes also his personality and efforts are great

4.5,W,dr gamble does a good job of not working you too hard i have her for an am and she does her best trying to get everyone to work together all in all she knows what she is doing and grades very very easy all you have to do is rewrite something with her suggestions and she is more than willing to give you a better grade than before
5.0,W,great professor loved her so much i am taking her again for lit easy grader wonderful personality highly recommended
5.0,W,i loved this class no it is not an a handed to you yes you do have to work and wake up its r professor murphy-lee is always enthusiastic about her subject sometimes it gets boring because the class moves too slowly for people who know history r easy if you do the work honors section easy as all get out do it for cr
2.5,W,the class was supposed to be easy but definitely changed it everything is graded harshly for a trad and she wastes a good half hr of students time at the beginning of class then makes you stay till the very end the sad part is she is a really nice person and open to helping you but her class is boring and too hard for a gened
4.0,W,i thought this class was really easy yes the essays can be graded hard depending on your ta she is too perky for me but at least she knows what talking about just go to class and do fine
2.5,W,this class is aweful i was told it was so easy but it definitey is not you must earn your grades and the essays are graded sooo hard she knows what she is talking about but she is so uninteresting russian is boring and i hate coming to this class attendance quizzes are frequent and they suck i hate this class
1.0,M,are you kidding me this guy is a prick he busted me for plagiarism after i asked him to look over my paper his class is so boring and a lot of notes this guys sucks these people dont know what they are talking about
3.0,M,seriously go to class if you your screwed do exactly what he says and you will get an a i have no idea how people can not get atleast a b he practically gives you the answers funny enjoyable dont care for people that dont come to class gives attendence times a class period
2.0,M,open book open notes but still not very east he wrote the book so if you get it in class and you ask and he just looks at you like figure it out at home cause he wrote the book blackmailed into taking not very effort a b i think the class is just so he can feel important
3.5,M,tries a bit too much to be humorous but he can be pleasant he does not allow you to leave the class and stares if you come in just a minute late tests could be a bit more clear do not challenge him to be wrong because he gets very irate one student took a test but sirkin lost it despite the room supporting him he still kicked the student out
1.5,W,she was just really boring and did not keep my attention at all
4.5,W,she will put the lecture outlines online and tell you to print them and bring them to class do it if you take notes on the outlines it is much easier to follow the test questions are based a lot on the lecture objectives if you read the objectives and can answer them you will do really well follow this advice
5.0,M,awesome this guy is a good teacher explains everything clearly and hes very nice tests are hard though so make sure u pay attention during class take him hes good
4.5,M,i have had several courses with this professor and i think he is excellent he is very demanding has a lot of reading but the tests are open book so if you are paying attention in class and do your work you will do very well i like his lecturing style he uses groups in his classes but you can do the papers on your own if you want
4.0,M,mixed feelings on this professor the work load was extremely difficult i hated the group component of the course it would have been very useful if our grade depend on it fair in his grading aside from the group grade and the subject matter is interesting the lectures were a bit dry and he expects a great deal workwise
5.0,M,i thought he was a great professor we only had three paper assignments which were fairly easy as long as you did the required reading during the class the papers were not long at all and our final was really really easy i would definately take him again listen to these other ratings he is a good professor
1.0,M,i learned to hate the language i already know he holds a chair in the dept he lets you know at the beginning of every lecture however what chair exactly i do not know very very unprofessional and pompous
5.0,M,i know how anyone could say anything negative about this prof such an honor to have a nationally recognized poet heading up the utpa english dept yet very unassuming and easily approachable if a person needs help i highly recommend him to anyone trying to learn to write poetry he helped me enormously
5.0,M,very thoughtful guy he is not very approachable but he loves each an every one of his students some people connect with him better than others i always believed that we were very similar so i think this kept us from getting to know each other better an honest hard working man
5.0,W,i have yasmin for spanish and again next semester for spanish and she is the best teacher i have ever had she is so helpful and even brings breakfast for us on fridays she really cares about her students and i have learned so much spanish
5.0,W,yasmin what you call her is extremely kind and treats her students like a mother she only takes attendence on random days homework is assigned but she never actually checks it we take tests and then the final which are all pretty easy great teacher
5.0,W,yasmin is sooooo sweet she actually cares to help and a day i was sick i asked a classmate to inform her i couldnt make it and she actually took time out to email me to say she hopes i get better you ask for a nicer woman
4.0,W,a great is so down to earth and knows what she is talkin makes bio fun
1.0,M,he tells jokes yes and tells stories not connected with an educational experience and kaboom classtime is over with i believe this is his goal filler to accomplish another class where is the meat where is an education dept at immac
3.0,W,overall a good teacher she is pretty boring though although she throws out a joke every now and again her grading is fair and the tests are too bad
3.0,W,just never mention the wave she gets mad if you critisize it and takes it very personally also impossible to get an a in her class which is bs if you desserve the grade then you should get it she rants sometimes and she sometimes does not take critiques
4.0,W,i agree that she is gentle and kind and she is also professional the work too hard and the lectures class discussion cover the readings in case you do them lots of videos and discussion which is a nice break from taking notes on your knees since the sdbi only has couches not desks
2.5,W,she is not a bad teacher is always willing to help if you need it just an extremley boring class and is relativley hard
4.5,M,cleaar your filthy ears out and listen to this man he knows what he is talking about and gives all he has left to do it best philosophy doctor in my days
4.0,M,hes a nice guy willing to do whatever it takes for you to learn the material i took it in the summer and it easy by no means i spent alot of extra time in the math lab so i could understand it i would have loved to take him in a longer semester and not too bad looking for an older man
3.5,M,mr lawson is a remarkably helpful and interested professor he is not easy but he is very fair he really wants you to do well although i know some people think him confusing i took him after barely making it through highschool math classes and he is the first teacher i have understood he has a bit of a temper so smart mouth him
3.5,M,mr lawson is a good teacher sometimes he allows himself to get distracted and he does lecture on his personal beliefs occasionally but usually very helpful i had a very easy time with his class but admittedly i already knew the material and was simply getting an easy math credit still i would reluctantly recommend him
1.5,M,i graded for mr lawson and the way that he grades homework does not help the students he simply wanted me to check that it was done not whether it was right or wrong staff in the advising center told me not to take him when i asked them which teacher i should take students have told me that he is very hard to understand and not helpful
5.0,M,cares about the students i highly recommend him
4.0,M,i had never gotten higher than a c in highschool i got a b in his class
2.0,M,terrible teacher as a person he is pretty nice but hes teaching style is so confuseing and tests are really hard would not reccomend him
4.0,W,professor is very nice and is willing to help but i done decent in the class grades great but certainly not the worst i failed the final so she failed me for the entire semester i have to take it again there is nothing fair about this
5.0,M,i had dr arrigo a number of years ago as a graduate student and his classes were nothing like what these freshmen are describing attendance was mandatory class discussions were stimulating and papers were challenging he was one of the best teachers i ever had
5.0,M,this guy is a awesomest teacher he has a really funny dorky personality he makes the class fun and is willing to give his students a break his lectures are really really helpful
5.0,W,ms jones is an excellent teacher she goes over our homework with us in class works the problems out on the board and goes step by step through the problem she move on till whoever was confused is now clear on the issue she goes into great detail teaching math and explains math in terms of our everyday life take her for math
2.5,W,ms lawson this is the most hardiest class i ever took in my life take notes in class but not on her tests use publisher website alot tests are very hard most of every thing is online as far as tests quizes and assigments also every thing oniine as far as tests and quizes are timed
1.5,W,she is extremely liberal if attendance required i would have never gone to class the things that she lectures on the test any way but you must take notes because that will be your final exam everything is online and all straight from the book i like her teaching style or her opinions at all
4.5,W,ms lawson is a pretty good teacher be prepared to read though nothing said in class is on the tests use the website a lot it is a tremendous help she has a habit of talking about her personal beliefs though which can get annoying paying to learn psych not listen to her beliefs
3.5,W,she is an okay teacher good luck on the test nothing she says in class is on her test test comes straight from the book you better read
5.0,W,she has to be one of the greatest teachers
5.0,W,i liked her teaching style if thinking about taking her go ahead learn a lot and it will be an easy grade however i warn about her quizes on the computer it sucks being timed while doing a quiz but get the hang of it

4.0,M,taking with ramin really kindled my interest in cs a dynamic and lucid lecturer with a flair for the material his exams were engaging the homework was interesting and manageable i hear good things about machine vision but comment from personal experience
2.0,M,what can i say about him he is annoying when he snaps his fingers or goes comes to class our hwk like days before a test and expect us to do good when we have a million other things to he makes me laugh a lot which is good compared to most teachers
5.0,M,an excellent teacher he brings a sense of humour to the classroom that is sorely missed he presents information in a clear manner and openly encourages the class to participate in the lecture this interaction is a great bonus he certainly knows his stuff and makes it available to all the class i was dreading to take has become my favourite
5.0,W,no exaggeration the best professor i have had at the school approachable friendly and intelligent and can explain herself clearly and concisely you can tell she enjoys what she does and waht she teaches and teaches you everything you need to know to be critical and smart too a must-have for the school
4.0,W,great stuff she really knows her stuff and conveys it enthusiastically and compellingly not the easiest of graders but fair easy on the eyes too
1.0,M,ridiculous puts things on tests that he never goes over in class tests very unfair basically by the end of the semester hate him intensely so just save yourself the trouble and take anything teaching
1.0,M,roy nutter is the most unfair professer i have ever had he takes off points on some tests and not on others avoid him if possible when i went to him to talk about my test grade he laughed at me and made me even more angrier

5.0,W,dr jasken is my all-time fave professor at mcdaniel she treats her students with respect and is always willing to help you learn i have taken many classes with her and everyone just loves her she is wonderful
5.0,W,dr jasken was very nice and helpful but the class was pretty difficult since the class was required i definitely recommend her as the teacher
3.0,W,very nice engaging etc but her class activities are a little be relevant to the subject matter i know why this was a class also teaching outdated technology not entirely fault but she clearly up on current standards
4.0,W,a great teacher and she really gets inside of your loved the class
4.5,W,great class expect to work you ass off though one of the only class you prob wont fall asleep in she has a lot of energy dont bring your cell but great class
5.0,W,wendy is one of the vew professors at risd who is confidently at the top of her field and whose work and teaching are maintaining the much-hyped and currently somewhat fragile reputation
2.5,W,i have very few words to describe deb you have to have a class with her to know her degree of spaciness some of us wonder whether she came to class stoned i tried my hardest and did well but not sure what i learned in the class the sleds were very fun to make though
1.5,W,her assignments were lame and she barely held our interest also she got highly frustrated if any of us tried to enjoy being in studio for eight hours the sled project was tons of fun but she just threw it at us without any introduction to woodworking and expected us to make fine quality sleds
4.0,W,i enjoyed this class even though is not my forte we had some fun projects teapots egg beating project sled very helpful if you ask for it but not going to hold your hand the whole way through if you satisfied with a project ust tell her and show her how hard you worked and take that into consideration
2.5,W,deb is just flaky more so than other teachers she likes poetic explanations but mostly her own and it is tough to convince her of other ideas one day we had a tea party for the entire morning however she actually does pay attention to the level of craftsmanship and will reward effort more than you think gets really pissed when kids slack off
2.0,M,easy teacher but expect to really get anything out of the class he could make jokes but i found him to be disorganized and arrogant ask to see him after complains constantly about how he has no time
2.5,M,very easy class he e-mails all the notes and the tests are all multiple choice he make class very interesting but it is an easy a
5.0,M,great guy very disorganized at times but his humor tries to make up for it gives great study reviews for exams highly recommended
2.5,M,a cute little dude and crazy about economics the first test was really easy but the last few got pretty difficult i felt like the notes really relate to the exams but he does offer some helpful pre-exams on line
5.0,W,great instructor genuinely wants to help her students succeed if you needed help outside of class always took the time to make sure you understood recommended
4.5,W,her classes are heavily lecture based her classes are relatively mangable except the research paper she is very respectful and is willing to help you when you need it
5.0,M,he is a great teacher he is willing to help you if you understand something and he is willing to explain things in different ways to help you understand he does talk monotone sometimes but get excitied as he goes through lessons highly recommended
2.5,M,take schibig if you have to take mann this guy only cares about tennessee chesnut trees how does that relate to i know all test came from powere point and he reads that power point word for word very boring ugh and i liked this subject before i met him
4.0,M,lectures are all done with powerpoint slides test questions are taken from information in those slides good teacher knows his stuff and explains well for people new to anatomy
4.0,M,he is a little dull but a very thorough teacher he does no review for a test but his test come right from his power point notes he is growing on me he gives extra credit too he also lets you know what the extra credit is ahead of time give him a chance
3.5,W,i loved her who is helpful and always nice but her tests were too hard too many questions that she teach in the class many questions on the tests came from the textbook which is more than pages
4.0,M,mr hackney is a wonderful teacher and if you just take the time to memorize all of his powerpoints you will do great in this class oh and buy the book only opened up times and could have found the info from it elsewhere and saved
1.0,W,she is the worst teacher ever stay very far away she will not explain anything in class or if you miss when you ask a question she exactly answer it the test are extremly hard even if you go to class take it will hurt
3.5,W,she extremely clear but a very nice lady who knows what she is talking about when it comes to business i would suggest taking her at least into to bus
4.5,M,mr espey is a wonderful teacher he is friendly helpful and always interested in what one has to say i have enjoyed him so much i am taking a different class with him next semester
3.5,M,mr powers is very intimidating now that i have been in class awhile i see that he is very helpful his tests are very hard he loves chemistry and it shows
5.0,M,i was scared to death of chemistry before taking this class mr powers is awesome and one of the best teachers i have had so far he makes it interesting and makes a hard subject easy to learn he will explain until we understand and opens up for questions i highly recommend him for fundamentals of chemistry
4.5,M,he is so helpful and informative sometimes the lectures blow you away but he is so full of information the labs are super easy but really helpful his tests are extremely hard and do pay attention to definitions because they are on the test if you want to learn chemistry and have it stick with you take this guy
2.0,M,i hate it when teachers are so anal about their time schedule they never review for the test which is always on monday to ruin your weekend before a big test we finish the chapters ahead of schedule and he went right into the some god awful chapter not even on the test how about a review or answer some questions we might have
5.0,M,best teacher i have ever had loved his classes more then other i took rip jim you will be missed greatly

4.5,M,his class was very easy he passed people who had really bad speeches we watched alot of movies and wasted time to get an a
4.0,W,gaines was a good teacher she really cares about her job and she interacts with the students well at times her lectures and classes can be entertaining i had her for speech communications and the speeches we had to do were not that bad her tests are not that hard although sometimes they can be a little tricky i would reccommend her
5.0,M,dw was a great teacher he made most of the lecture interesting to listen to sometimes he would make the assignment seem harder then it really was if not a linear thinking type of person the class will be a little harder but hey i still got a b
5.0,M,he is a very good teacher he really helped me prepare for my speeches i would take him again
3.5,M,professor warner was great as a person however we spent the first to weeks in class going over how to post a bulletin i dont like when teachers waste time on meaningless things such as this he was always very helpful though in being clear about assignments and what needed to be studied for test
5.0,M,i love mr warner you must take him he wants his students to do well he gives every opportunity to make good grades we even go over homework every class time so do the right thing all gotten are in his class you must take him he is very nice and welcoming you can totally tell he likes what he does take mr warner
5.0,W,she does make you do a lot of papers but what college is all about you have to do a lot of reading but there again what college is all about if you need help she will help you she gives extra credit she is a cool person not stuck up or anal at all she is very in to what she does theatre

5.0,M,great teacher he knew how to push me to reach my potential he always offered help before and after class for those who wanted it his tests were easy if you studied for them i wish he was not limited to just math he would be great in other subjects as well he relates with his students since he has been there before
5.0,M,todd is the best teacher you could ever want to have if algebra has always been difficult for matter if everyone in the class is getting it and you always take the time to make sure you understand before you leave his class he rocks
5.0,M,awesome teacher he does whatever it takes to help you succeed
4.5,M,holy crap what are thinkin i love this woman her class was so frickin easy and she loves class discussions homework was minimal and he grades fairly easy oh man if i was still at vscc i would take her in a heart-beat awesome teacher
4.5,W,holy crap what are thinkin i love this woman her class was so frickin easy and she loves class discussions homework was minimal and he grades fairly easy oh man if i was still at vscc i would take her in a heart-beat awesome teacher
1.0,W,she is the worst teacher i have ever had she will embarass you put you down and make you afraid to ask questions because of the nasty responses you get she is rude and nasty and unhelpful i dreaded going to her class and so did the rest of the class unfortunately for educ majors having her as a teacher is unavoidable so be prepared
1.0,W,she is not a great instructor what so ever
2.5,W,always late and scatterbrained the group projects were fun when you write papers for her she grades horribly told us to write an opinion paper one page-then commented that i had too much personal opinion and needed to add more fact to make it longer i get straight in all upper division hutchins courses and she gives me on papers
1.0,W,absolutely awful she is the most horrible teacher and has a dumbass aid jerod who cannot hear and marked people absent when they biggest waste of time she should be fired
2.0,W,gotten better now that she has hearing aides a bit scatterbrained though nice and you make alot of puppets but you might not learn alot she really likes woody allen

5.0,M,awesome teacher but you must show up to class thats where you get prepared for your teaches he is very passionate and knows what works trust it midterm was difficult on blooms taxonomy but over all easy the teaches were easy as well not mention kinda fun
5.0,M,awesome teacher he is great i totally recomend him and i wish he taught more courses the teaches are a bit nervewrecking depending on your lab instructor luckily i got a great one take his class
4.5,M,attendance is tells you what he wants and how he wants a bit is essay are required to teach in a group teaches can be difficult depending on your lab instructor some can be very picky make sure your teach group interacts your grade depends on them helping you and asking the right questions
4.0,M,very good professor knows his subject very well willing to help you it is very hard not to pass this class the teaches are a bit nerve-wrecking but it gets better very inspirational guy as well
4.5,M,he provides you with great practical information for teaching strategies he is fun articulate and knowledgeable the classes require quite a bit of work and the mid-term and final are tough
2.5,M,i guess he is a good teacher definately better than the majority of ed profs at fiu but he is extremely cocky and most of the lectures are spent listening to him explain how he is the greatest teacher ever he is extremly opinionated and doesnt allow for students to have their own opinion pertaining to ed also the labs are unfair be in group b
5.0,M,super nice professor you will learn alot from him the labs are a bit difficult if you are in group a because you only have one week to prepare each lab and group b has but he knows his stuff and is entertaining really cares about giving you useful information
5.0,M,above all a great person he is a great teacher his class is educational and entertaining great sense of humor i wish he taught other classes my best fiu professor to date
3.5,W,class as entertaining as the disscusions of the topic which at times were trite but she does try to apply the class to modern day and mix up topics history politics culture pop quizes on the readings but they tough eases up around finals watching movies in spanish i would recomend but also depends on how interested your classmate
4.0,W,pretty though i think she expects a lot but you will learn in her class her tests are pretty easy all you have to do is pay attention to class discussions and do well on the tests
4.0,W,ms serra is not the easiest teacher i have ever had but she is obviously motivated to help every student pass the class and learn to be a more confident speaker the other raters said she is very forgiving with absences but i do know people who were dropped for being absent too much after all a speech class and you have to be there
4.0,W,ms serra is awesome she wants you to be able to communicate well and to pass her class sometimes her lectures lack clarity but she makes up for that with plain silliness easy a if you just show up to clase though she is very forgiving if you miss just give her a good reason why
5.0,W,took another prof before and dropped because was too critical and was horrified of public speaking ms serra makes you feel very comfortable she has a very unique style which makes class number one goal is to make sure you pass highly recommend
5.0,W,great going person you will never be bord in her class
5.0,W,ms serra is a very odd instructor but in a good way she is very silly and fun and she helps you in any way possible to succeed in the class she will do anything it takes to get you to come to class she even thows pizza parties this class is very enjoyable and an easy a
5.0,W,she is the nicest woman ever low is very got a kidney infection in the middle of semester and was out for tried to come back and she said you dont look so well go home and rest nicest woman ever no tests midterms and finals sooo nice just engage in dicsussion you will make her day

5.0,W,i love carla she emphasizes discussion in class if you have something to say she listens compassionate grader and excellent professor who obviously enjoys teaching take her class if you can
5.0,M,great teacher professor andy jones made the six-week quarter fly by i liked his powerpoint quizzes and his crazy allusions the class is a lot of work but he grades fair i really appreciated wide-eyed humor he connects almost everything we read to other assigned works or to pop culture i would take another class with him in a minute
5.0,M,i learned a lot from dr andy about how to think and how to write a funny guy who makes a reaaally long class three hours in the summer fly by he makes you get to know your classmates which is also cool the group assignment was tough mostly because of scheduling challenges but i learned the most from that paper and from office hours
5.0,M,dr class really inspired me to learn and to think creatively about my writing and he also brings a ton of energy to class discussions i can see why asucd gave him the professor of the year award congrats andy
4.0,M,he was a little unusually but really engaging class was always interesting and he held my attention i also learned a great deal and even sort of look at life a little differently now it is a shame he no longer teaches
1.0,M,there are no words to describe the torture his class inflicted on me he is disorganized unclear boring and shares too much personal information the were not that bad but his lectures were horrible avoid him
1.0,M,ok so this class is by far the worst class in sociology i have taken as a matter of fact the worst ever lectures are so boring and his teaching is so unorganized the reader and his handouts were complicated to find nothing was in order and it was simply just not enjoyable i hope he hasnt been teaching it this way all this time finally over
2.5,M,very confusing i regret enrolling in this class his soc class is way more tolerable than soc
4.0,W,social theory is not an easy course the tests are hard she is difficult to pay attention to read the book and do the group presentation you really do have to read the book she says so and serious
5.0,M,he expects you to try your best and work your hardest he will even come in outside of class just to help you if you need help he doesnt mind you calling him at home he is extremely caring and understanding if you have outside problems that effect your work he does come off as extremely intemidating but dont let that fool you he is wonderful
5.0,M,very nice easy class is he married
1.0,M,i never ever had a prof like is not a fair marker he will give marks who will listen his own
3.5,M,i know if he just hated me but he destroyed my homework grade and hit a huge dent into my gpa he docks huge points for simple mistakes even if you arrive to the correct answer so watch yourself
4.5,M,he is very clear and distinct about what he expects from you his reviews are very similar to the tests his tests are questions and he counts off a lot for little mistakes but the tests are easy if you go to class and the in class reviews
5.0,M,this was a very good class with an even better teacher he is very respectful of everyone and gets across a lot of information in a short amount of time great class
4.5,M,i loved dr blythe after taking with him i just had to take because i loved him so much very nice guy
4.5,W,she is super sweet but her class is hard there is a nest test book we had to do and it was really difficult to predict what questions would be on there so you know which point of the book to really pay attention to but over all great just make sure you do all the work assigned including the study guide
5.0,W,dr carmean is my academic advisor and has helped me in so many ways her classes are by no means they are a lot of fun you can tell that she really gets into some anthropology if you have the chance you should take make it a point to take her you will not regret you will work hard
5.0,W,wonderful professor very clear about what she expects and very helpful seems to enjoy teaching and wants her students to learn and understand the material
3.0,M,a difficult professor if lazy like me lots of homework and the tests are from the hw final project seemed difficult based on what i saw others do i do it but still passed only because i handed in literally chapters of past homework on the last day not the worst cs professor but i take him again

5.0,W,dr young is an excellent professor she makes you use what the good lord has blessed you with ya brain she is also very helpful and her classes are fun i use to look forward to attending her classes last semeter
4.5,W,dr young is a great teacher if you are willing to put in the effort on her assignments she grades reasonably and is always willing to help if you need it
3.5,W,she is a really good techer everyone looked forward to her class but be prepared to have your essays read aloud in the class and picked at but it will essentially help you to become a better writer when you know that your peers will view your paper
5.0,M,mr carter is a very nice easy and very gives extra points on the test even if the answer is will regret taking him

4.5,M,mr annunobi was a funny teacher his class was very easy i got an a out of the class i hardly study for his class i never did my homework the tests were fairly easy
4.0,M,dr annunobi is a nice funny teacher his tests can be hard at times but overall he is a great teacher big on attendance but if you show up for every single class and do the work its easy to pass also get on his good side he wont fail you at all then

5.0,M,he really knows a lot about political theory i thought this was going to be a booooooooooooring course but made it really interesting
5.0,W,dr carnes seemed a little scary at first but i learned to like her and she worked her way into becoming one of my favorite teachers at eku her short report helps set the stage for the field report and both are pretty simple if you follow directions i was able to achieve a on the field report presentations bad just nerve-wracking
5.0,W,i took dr carnes for orientation and it was easy she made us go to campus events but it just helped us realize what all went on at eku she made me excited to take more business classes in the next years
2.0,W,dr carnes was not my favorite she expected waay too much work for a hr class she is not very helpful avoid taking her at all costs

5.0,W,definately take a class that she teaches extremely nice and funny and she makes class interesting
1.0,M,this class was extremely boring even though he gives you everything that is on the midterm and final there is an insane amount of information to know most of the info terms you have to look up on-line because you were not able to find it in pages of notes and he will not help you at all
2.5,M,so boring and all he does is lecutre tests--study fifty will be on and you pick each expected to be a page in blue book essay--study seven will be on you pick should be pages if you guess right be ok aside from extreme hand pain but he holds you accountable for insane amount of info
5.0,W,catherine was hard but good she knew her stuff and helped her students get jobs at good places i think all dissing her are just mad because she gave you a bad grade
4.0,M,dr grover is one of best teachers he is interesting and real his class is not easy but if you show up and take notes you should be okay he makes learning fun he is very intelligent if you get the chance take his class you wont regret it
4.5,M,favorite professor ever only one final paper and then exams easy class was intersting and he always had people laughing mouth like a truck driver sometimes doesnt hold back doesnt teach by the book never had to open it once during the semester either had him for criminology and juvenile justice take him for every class that you can
5.0,W,she is very strict and hard on students but when the class i took with her was over i realized that i learned a lot more than i learn with easy teachers shes also very passionate about what she teaches
3.0,M,i never read the material and made up crap for the essays and still mangae to get a b all i can say is at least he kept me interested
4.5,M,took him for internship seminar you can tell a good professor but he gives way too much work for interns who are already slaving away giving hours a week to a course where they are getting credits too much busy-work and writing that means nothing for a class that is
4.0,M,he is a great professor the material covered is worth knowing he is not an easy grader but he puhes you to get a better grade he is very funny and keeps you awake have such a good time learning you would wish the class endured class how good he was take him take him take him and oh yeah take him

3.5,W,i had dr curtner-smith for and now for she is very nice and helpful but her classes are extremely time consuming they should definitely count more than credit hours she knows her stuff though and you will definitely learn from her
5.0,W,i learned a ton of useful info in this class and found it really interesting her examples help you remember the information and the stuff you learn actually applies to real life very helpful professor
2.0,W,hard tests she was crazy about attendance and then at the end of the semester it count against you if you were there or not awful class
1.5,W,dr curtner smith is an intelligent woman but i did not like her as a professor she is very confusing as far as assignments and test material goes and is not an effective communicator at all she talks about her family for of class time and hardly gives any useful information in way of tests etc her class is not easy
1.0,W,i dread going to this class ms curtner smith is an annoying communicator by the way she stutters through statements and says um alot she tends to teach more towards those with psychology backgrounds if you do not have one then you probably wont know what she is talking about and she explain it either very boring teacher do not take
1.0,W,very hard and dread going to this class every single day it takes her a week to post grades and all the tests are scantron do not take this class if you have to the class is miserable and i know anyone who likes going to it she always goes off subject and keeps you the full time awful class and awful teacher

4.5,M,a great guy and a good teacher you do not have to buy a book and he is always ready to help you out but turn your work in on time he might deduct a day from late work but he will give you a break once in a while just do not count on it learned alot and had fun as well
1.0,W,shes horrible i would never take her again
2.5,W,seems like a nice laid-back professor then you get your first paper back and realize that the same writing abilities that have gotten you by with since middle school get you a d in her class very disorganized and her class is pretty much pointless to go to contemp sucks enough without having the the paper nazi as a professor

1.0,M,arrogant arrogant arrogant this man is possibly the most arrogant assh ever met in my entire life and has zero people skills and basically admit when he makes a mistake absolutely no help arrives late to class yet has expectations that you are on time and professional when he clearly is not he should be fired immediately
2.0,M,this guy is a complete try to switch out of his class if at all possible everything that everyone has said below is true and for me it was even more he has no respect for his students or their lives and thinks that his class should revolve around him
1.0,M,homework always returned late class of and have to wait weeks sometimes kept classes late our last one was minutes late for many assignments he sent out another page of clarifications due to the ambiguous nature of the first set of directions sometimes when you had already completed the work or only had hours left to do so

5.0,W,she is one of if not best teachers i have ever is so amazing and awesome she gets her points across gwell keeps you interested and if you struggling she will help you go over assignments with you so you get a bad grade on it if you do every thing she tells you in class with at least effort you should no lower than a b

5.0,M,great professor he is always on the level with his students and will do almost anything to help them out
5.0,M,dr rawdon is easily one of the best profs at duquesne he takes a class that could be very monotonous and makes it fun he moves very quickly but always willing to slow down and help if you need it his combination of humor and serious teaching makes the class fly by and before you know it you understand calc pretty amazing
2.0,M,he is a funny guy but thats not what the class should be about he doesnt teach all he just copies problems onto the board straight from the book and then tells a story about his son he isnt very good at answering questions either

3.0,W,sanchez is a total freak talking about sex with college students makes her day if you are a christian or have any set of morals beware she is the most extreme liberal professor ever had i respect the fact that she has an opinion on issues like abortion but she will try to force her extreme liberal views down your neck
4.5,M,thick accent but easy open note open book take home tests be much easier to get an a then that in other words he is the man
2.0,W,she sucks
5.0,W,i loved taking her class although she likes to talk about her kids she deserves it sounds like theyve been through it but she is a really good teacher and if you need help she will give it if you ask she also has a good sense of humor the best
3.5,M,got an a in his sociology winter class he has a very abrasive personality get in your face and ask you rude questions sometimes his remarks are stereotypes which will offend you overall his tests too bad make sure you read the book and review it he does give home tests use these to your advantage

4.5,M,i enjoyed his class yes his tests were slightly difficult but if you study the material be ok he graded the wellness projects pretty easy too he really knows what talking about i would recommend him to anyone
4.0,W,a good teacher but go to office hours and ask her to help you with your paper you learn more in her office than in pretty meaty amount of reading but not too bad
4.0,M,had him for a few classes i like his teaching style he explains things in different ways to try and help everyone understand if you struggle with phil try harder or take phil classes you just have to read and participate in the class discussions for any of his classes and it will start to make more sense def one of my fav profs
4.0,M,i would take him again is that not enough he has office hours and is there and will talk with you about concerns projects et c is that not enough he knows what he is talking about there take the class
3.5,M,hoyt is a good teacher this class is a little difficult especially if you take the honors level but the class is very helpful not a normal philosophy class about your opinions its simply about logic and reasoning hoyt sometimes has diffficulty explaining the info however this may be because the info is diffucult i would take him again
2.5,M,mr shorr is a freak he yells at students who raise their hands i always felt scared to breathe let alone speak he has anger management issues and often seemed like he was about to pull a dr david banner and turn green and rip his shirt off beware i got an a but it was an ordeal
4.5,M,the exam format seems to be a trend of history profs the fact that he require you to talk is a bonus since you then get participation points for free raising your hand is a courtesy thing since i pay to listen to him and not someone that once took a trip somewhere packed with knowledge and was fun to learn from
4.5,M,very fun professor he makes going to class fun and you still learn from him he is also on the students side ex if you think you should have done better on a test talk with him and he will most likely give you some extra points i want to take as many classes with him as i can
4.5,M,this class was hard a lot of information but he is willing to work with you and he is always around in case you have questions if you have to take this class i strongly recommend taking it with rogers
5.0,M,he is a really good teacher he gives extra credit and curves some test he is there to help anyone who needs it he uses powerpoint and that is super useful his test are super hard but passable you just have to study your but off this class in general is not easy

5.0,M,good professor material easy but he lets you know what he requires from you
5.0,W,tromp is one of those professors that i encourage everyone regardless of their major to take before they graduate she forced us to take a seemingly simple subject and wrap our minds around it in a way most students have never considered her classes are fun stimulating and generally unbiased do the work with pride and do fine in class
5.0,W,incredibly intelligent and engaging fair and very accessible genuinely passionate about the subject matter and truly concerned about her students challenging but very reasonable and willing to help however possible
3.0,W,basically as everyone else already said unapproachable indubitably intelligent her not too hard since i eventually did get end up with an a in the class with this extremely difficult material but told me to fear her
5.0,W,take a class with her it will blow your mind
5.0,W,rebecca has a brilliant mind she gives great lectures regardless of what others say i find her very approachable and yes she deserves a chillie pepper
1.0,M,he is also listed as luke brown listen to these raters this guy is a time bomb waiting to explode on you the class give imm quiz when he hears a cell phone explain projects marks absent if tardy you when you speak incorrect mathematical grammar all but people dropped class by withdrawal date left failed class
4.0,M,incredibly knowledgeable this man really makes you learn exposed me to a side of the world and another way of life all in one class very helpful outside of courses he even helped me with projects for other classes though no assigned readings and not as much material as i wished gets still reccomend taking his class
3.0,M,i had dr taylor for intro to african american family while the course material was very interesting the professor was not always clear i enjoyed the class because of the course material and dr taylor is a very intelligent man who offers alot of useful information to his students i would only recommend this class to dedicated students
4.0,M,very monotone however as others have said he is incredibly helpful and labs are really easy marks
5.0,M,this guy is soooo funny always making us laugh very helpful when you need his help too if i had one word to describe him quirky
4.5,M,hes a good guy grading isnt entirely based on your he really encourages classroom interaction so take advantage of participation points i also took with him and it was very interesting but kinda gross
4.0,M,wicked nice guy his grading was pretty lenient and shows he cares about his students by taking time after class to talk with students and their concerns however keep up with the reading because if you fall behind youre screwed
4.0,M,took this class as a gen ed and found it facinating salloway is an entertaining lecturer and a very interesting guy but he does dedmand hard work
2.0,M,he used to be such a great guy i looked forward to class with him but lately just grouchy and mean and sometimes hurtful no need to crush unsuspecting former students be your best friend until you do something he thinks is beneath make you feel like a loser
4.0,M,salloway really wants everyone to learn the material very scatterbrained in terms of teaching style and thus sometimes hard to follow but a wonderfully jolly and kind man he looks like santa he really knows his stuff and tries to make class worthwhile for students his tests easy but he grades fairly and scales a really great class
3.5,W,she is totally awesome she might not have the time to meet up so if a student who likes to meet up with her after class to dicuss things she probably appeal to you what i loved about prof geller is that she provided a on approach to learning very knowledgleable fair always looked forward to her class
1.0,W,she really know what she is talking about she always explain questions from students in class and when she does some are incorrect relies to heavily on to do her work all she does is grade your blue books if you have no problem teaching yourself be just fine she really uses website as
3.0,M,a weeding out class for pre-allied health students very successful at losing students too when those who are left after months and the average on his exam is something is wrong not very interesting lectures lab is fine all memorization and identify tissue we put to use anything learned i recommend
1.5,W,crazy about her teaching style she used handwritten overheads the whole quarter which included abbreviations that no one understood
5.0,M,a very smart professor a good lecturer if you need help just ask very helpful and friendly if you approach he honestly wants you to do well and to teach well so if you come to learn you have a problem
3.5,M,he is very knowlegable about history he really knows his stuff and can answer pretty much any question he can be difficult to approach with questions at times but he tries to be available to his students
5.0,M,knows his stuff

5.0,M,this professor is very involved and loves what he is teaching if your not an art major or have art experience in highschool this class will be vary hard he expects you to have basics do it if you want an easy a
5.0,M,gotta love this guy hilarious and he knows his stuff definitely helpful if you stay for the entire lab and ask questions
1.5,M,a nice guy and will try his best to pass you if you show effort but he just cant teach he goes rediculously fast in spots painfully slow in others and has all his notes on overheads which he changes out you finish writing a decent prof to take but wind up learning most of everything from the book does help in office hours
1.5,M,this prof knows what he is doing but know how to explain all the points to the class clearly he has a different way of doing math than the book he also speaks to the class as if everyone is five years old another downside is that his tests are pretty much harder than the ap test itself word of the review but it help you
3.0,M,not bad on grading not the best at getting his point across better than some but not the best
5.0,M,to say that this man is one of the best profs on this campus only begins to describe the incredibly positive impact he has had on the lives of so many of his students
5.0,M,this guy knows his stuff just make sure you get things handed in on time
1.5,W,probably the worst prof i had while in university if you do not need to take her classes i suggest you stay away
5.0,M,this professor is truly a god he is so incredible and he even know it the way he talks is mesmerizing and he can keep your attention for hours that is if you can concentrate without staring at his gorgeous body he is one of the smartest people i have ever met and is so willing to help students in need
5.0,M,being a beautiful man he is brilliant and mysterious i love his are easy to follow

5.0,M,todd is one of the best profs had in years at uvm hilarious insightful and really knows his stuff his lectures are pretty much like a comedy act and throughout them he makes or critical points that are easy to pick up on and understand take a class with this man if you have the chance
2.5,M,this prof is class is hard and you have to study for it he is a good prof but not easy the lab does help and try to show up to class it seems like that makes a difference to this is the only class you have then probably will do good

2.0,M,david tindall is a very nice prof and tries to help but i feel that this course is way beneath what he knows
2.0,W,this professor is very knowledgeable and her tests in were cake but she was very rude to me and other students she promotes class conflict and makes assignments more difficult than they need to be her personality is very abrasive
1.0,W,this class is completely subjective and she teaches it very unfairly she let half the class have cameras for a week longer than the rest of our class and still considers it to be a fair assignment she told us to pretend it was like survivor sorry but i remember signing up for a tv show at registration
5.0,W,dr farrer is by far the greatest professor at cal she is organized and clear which are great attributes to model to future teachers she was my absolute favorite

5.0,M,an incredible professor modern british novel was my favorite part of tuesdays and thursdays the material is difficult but prof fogel is very encouraging and helpful in addition probably the funniest professor encountered his mind seems to work at lightspeed
1.0,M,dr garner is by far the worst prof ive ever had his notes in class are pointless because all he does is prove or equations and where the equations came from then be able to work complex problems with little examples he doesnt care about his students at all we started the class with plus students and today in the final there was
2.0,M,lectures are pretty well organized but he feels like he must prove every formula tests and quizzes are similar to examples and homework gives extra credit on friday classes for attendance sometimes not a bad class if you study
4.5,M,a pretty good lecturer his lectures are organized and straight forward his quizzes are pretty much like the homework problem he assigns the exams are mostly multiple choice written prob and he gives you a formula sheet to use i find it to be easy if you study the hw problems he posts solutions online before the exam great prof
1.0,M,wish he was a gardener and not a teacher must have trained lev cuz they both are the two worst professors i have ever had i passed calc with a b so math my problem bad teacher some reason tests are scantron it is a math does that make he is too lazy to grade
2.0,M,nice guy really loves physics he tries hard but is not too good at explaining physics good enough for people to really understand it
1.0,M,the worst teacher i have ever had he cannot explain how to do anything relevant the main points that you need to know come after minutes of nonsense proof do not take him for calculus based physics worst teaching job ever
2.0,M,he makes it harder than it has to be course moves very quickly the gradding scale is the only saving grace is an a b c d and he drops your lowest test and quiz grade seems ridiculous but you will need it our class average on the last test was a good luck
3.0,W,very hard teacher makes you work like a dog for a good grade very condescending and unclear got nicer and easier halfway through the class but only because one of the students nearly had a mental breakdown last half of the semester was fun i learned a lot but still i recommend taking a class with her unless you absolutely have to
5.0,M,dr das taught classes while waiting to get his residency to become a doctor he really new his material in human phys and made the class interesting he realized that students take more than one class at a time something most professors dont understand
1.0,W,pure me an f because not religious or a the hardest marker ever encountered in university take her classes
5.0,M,this man is truly a nerd among nerds but also a fantastic math teacher if you like silly math riddles this class is for you he loves to put tricky questions on the tests and there is a problem of the week which is basically a mathriddle that he wants to share with you altogether not bad keep an eye out for tricks and you should be ok
3.0,M,do not take this class from jerry unless you really really love math jerry makes the tests much harder and longer than they need to be his final took many students hours to complete is this legal his lectures and hw assignments are pretty good miss his lectures or you will be bitten i wish i had not taken this class from him

5.0,W,i have taken a few of her classes i also chose her as my senior seminar coach she was very nice and helpful as a teacher--she is a jem she was always excited about the content and she made us feel the same way
5.0,W,this woman is the reason i finish college wish they were all like her
3.0,W,she is an ok teacher but i think she is bi-polar she is happy one minute and then the next thing you know she is screaming down your throat mess up whatever you do she is now teaching at columbus state though
5.0,M,professor walker is good at explaining the subject matter and very helpful he really wants his students to succeed i had to end up dropping the class because it was just too much with too many credit hours but if i were to try econ again i would definitely try to get walker he makes economics interesting and also friendly and funny
5.0,M,been awhile since law i thought professor frey was was my all time favorite law professor he was always willing to answer questions he really cares about his students and wants them to succeed marty rocks
5.0,W,prof miller is a very intelligent professor she really knows and has a passion for what she does she also hopes that her students will become engaged and at least somewhat enjoy what they do very helpful and although she expects a lot from her students we are afterall in college we you learn a lot from her
1.0,W,has basically a mail order mfa from spaulding university you go there a few times and do correspondence work and they hand you your diploma her teaching reflects how little she actually knows about poetry and her lack of a decent publication record reinforces it one day maybe au will hire a real poet but i doubt it sincerely
1.0,W,easily the worst classroom experience ever had she is condescending and rude and seems not to like male students
2.0,W,some are writing teachers because they make it as writers she is one of them very mean very arrogant lousy okay as a person but not as a prof

2.0,M,he is really lax about getting grades into the computer
4.5,M,he was an absolute godsend i took this class with different professors and he explained better taught better and kept the pressure off better than i thought was possible a good reason his classes fill up fast
5.0,M,a cool guy and pretty laid back he explains the notes very clearly he will do anything he can to help miss class or you will get behind he gives can bring you up up a letter grade he gives somes extra credit the tests are somewhat hard if you go over the notes and his study guides they are fine
1.0,M,the tuition should have had a better use i only remember his pages-long list of titles now
1.0,M,absolutely find no worthiness this old gentleman try to tell you what is patent and shareholder agreement which better google cheaper better and faster do not expect any practical thing from his class he is apparently enjoys hisself in class
5.0,M,this guy is amazing the best he is nearly yrs old but has twice the energy and euthasism than professors half his age his respect for students and love of teaching make all the other teachers in mcgill management look mediocre at best this guy should give a class to the mcgill professors on how to teach and motivate students
4.5,M,take this class unless you are extremely interested in learning chinese and have the time to devote to it if you do this class will be amazing and a lot of fun prof lian is so funny and a great help he will make the learning experience more interesting
3.0,W,easy as it gets for literature never bought one book for both classes and cut class all the time and still got imposible to stay in her class with dying of boardum if you need an easy must take
5.0,W,the best of the best very enthusiastic professor well spoken and knowledgeable on the subject a true inspiration to me she demands punctuality and participation is a must because she is active in her lectures
4.5,W,mrs brown is very happy with life and her family and it shows through her personality she can be tough on grading but i found her to be fair showing interest in what you are doing and class participation will get you a passing grade who wants to pass a class without deserving it oh you have to study ask questions for clarification
4.0,M,he was easy you have to do anything but show up make sure to do all the online quizzes and thats about it
4.0,M,i got deducted so many points for doing math wrong in his class make sure you divide your hr correctly the class is unstructured but make sure you do the damn online quizzes bucks to pass the class waste of time and money oh well
5.0,W,i thought she was very helpful and a great teacher compared to other english professors that i have come across
4.0,W,very dedicated professor great at explaining complicated theoretical texts and connecting them to the larger picture a tough grader but a tip if she allows you to turn in a rough draft of any essay for her comments and suggestions beforehand do it you will have a much better understanding of what looking for
5.0,W,unbelievably smart and has a wonderful way of boiling down ridiculously complicated critical essays into terms the average person can understand also is very funny in an intellectual sort of way had her for english and am taking another class with her next semester solely because she is teaching it a favorite
5.0,W,tough class but she did a tremendous job explaining intense theoretical issues with the texts and she is incredibly helpful
3.0,W,she is very smart and extremely dedicated but not very good at class discussion
5.0,M,his books were definetly not mediocre story of a million years is breathtaking and the wolf girl is really bizzare and fascinating and plenty of literary critics agreed i love uvm and transferred out but just talking to him made school more palatable for me while i was there take another class with him if i was still there
3.0,M,seems to be a very fair person i like listening to him read aloud but not everyone does his written comments are sometimes odd
2.5,M,he is really anal about reading aloud in class but his intentions are all good and the workload is pretty easy i thought when he handed out signed copies of his book it was a nice gesture though he does have kind of a bad taste in literature
5.0,W,simply one of the greatest drops all her work to attend to her students awesome
2.5,M,all he does in class is go over what will be on the test we get really long reviews which end up being only half the test just confusing but if you study the reviews you will do fine because he gives curves
4.0,M,i took dr shreiber for l c he is a pretty good professor but he does kind of ramble i thought i would dread the lab but it was actually kind of fun the tests that bad and the quizzes in lab are a joke you do have to read the book and he does expect you to talk about the chapters in class he was fun and kept it interesting
1.0,M,schreiber is awful u never know whats going to be on his tests and he lectures about evolution and everything that is not on the test its up to u to read all the chapters and figure out what the test will be i do not recommend him at all steer clear
5.0,M,this guy is great great sense of humor in a class that should have an intro to l c class the reading is very very difficult but there are certain fundamentals that the good doctor wants you to pick up if you can grasp that concept and make sure he gets the study guide to you then you will have a good time will take again
4.5,M,i think schreiber rocks great funny and interesting if you keep up with the subject read each chapter that is assigned and show up for lab he gives test study guides that are multiple choice and gives the answers to them passed all his test just by reading and going over the study guide my favorite teacher so far
4.5,M,damn good teacher practices what he preaches whoever says he teach probably listen in class and likes to slack off dude thats me and i still learnt so much he made me want to learn a lot of assignments but easy whoever says it clear because youre dumb and dont listen take him but dont slack
3.5,M,brian is a great teacher who loves what he does and it shows his notes were great and i found the lectures interesting and informative overall i found his classes very easy
4.0,M,an ok instructor assignments are a bit confusing as if not even sure what he really wants from us the assignments all that useful and he gave us way too much time in class to work on them
2.0,M,brian is a total joke his notes were and teach before we knew it we had a midterm and no one in the class knew r an easy class though you really need him to teach you very much if you look at your manual and book you will do fine the flp is easy
1.0,M,brian is a very bad teacher i would not recommend anyone talke his classes if they have to he is very unclear and all over the map with his teaching
1.0,W,she is more concerned about appearances she pretends to be nice and helpful but if you want to do anything besides teach in the rolla area she will immediately turn her back on you in all the students used to talk about what we could do to get her fired i know anyone who liked her but we all pretended to so she would pass us
1.5,W,a little outdated for an education teacher someone who was in the school system while dinosaurs were still on the earth should not still be teaching classes on education in my humble opinion that and she tends to be more concerned with appearances than with quality so as long as you and your papers look cute be fine
5.0,M,easy class tries to make the subject interesting but have much success its just a boring subject to work with cares about his students a lot and is always willing to help if needed
4.5,M,he is the definition of an effective teacher very willing to help and is understanding the material is a little boring and his powerpoints get kind of old but if you study what he tells you to it will be on the test do fine excellent class discussions
5.0,M,dr giger is awesome he totally loves god and his conducting and teaching show that i love this man heh
3.5,M,hard to understand because of his accent goes over material really fast i didnt feel like i was prepared for the tests he is a really nice guy tho and he sometimes just gives everyone on the quizzes when we dont understand it sometimes doesnt collect homework and gives everyone points for doing it
3.5,M,this teacher is cool has an accent while speaking but in time easy to catch on a real nice guy that helps all his students cares about them laid back and goofy i enjoyed his made finite math not so boring his tests too bad you understand the homework do fine

1.0,M,he is insane who cares if he has issues with himself he should not take it out on us bet money the one who posted those last two comments about himself please seek help glennon and get the hell out of depaul

4.5,W,she has a great knowledge of the subject and is a very kind professor it was an amazingly interesting course paper assignments were difficult though and she is a tough grader but if you enjoy the material it is definitely worth taking a course from her
1.0,W,tough on papers avoided difficult discussions sex etc all the interesting stuff she was afraid of the awesome exciting stuff we oculd have said awful for studies other subjects i hear better
4.5,W,very clear lectures you can tell professor enjoys teaching her subject and wants students to do well

1.0,W,this is a bad teacher she is so bitter and cranky you even ask her a question her getting mad dose not try to explain anything and is absent during the fall semester alot she needs to retire and not make this subject such a nightmare for students anatomy is very interesting and is the core for nursing students or tech
3.0,W,not a good teacher for the subject the material is hard enough and strenous as it is now add monotony to the lectures and outdated handounts i know a hard subject but if she so unbearably boring maybe more people could stay and pass her class
4.5,W,theatre and joanie is amazing since it is a class where we perform a play to an audience she can get strict at times but only because a production so class is mandatory like play rehearsal she is so much fun and makes theatre fun if never acted this class is perfect for you joanie is vibrant and loving and extremely cool
3.0,W,i took the online course and it that bad i suppose if you have to see her in person better to talk to however she did freak out on us when one person posted a message in the wrong topic other than that she was chill
1.0,W,everyone has pretty much said it all but here it is again she is very unclear runs about four weeks behind in her grading throughout the whole semester so it is hard to tell how you are doing she gets mad very easy and does not have a sense of humor at all terrible teacher do not take her class

1.0,M,i know he uses the scare tactics to weed out the bad students but give me a break he red flags me as a trouble maker just coz i actually came to lab on time lab starts as stated on the schedule at i come in at says wait outside bull lectures are useless stay home and read the book also for your own sake take sato or gober for lab
3.0,M,prof vandergrift is an excellent that i dont mean easy its not him its the students it would always depend on you and only you its a hard class now but doing his share and its gonna be ok if you do your share who are saying worst are those that wants to get away with this class easily
2.5,M,i rated the easiness a for the avg person who knows nothing about anat rude and uptight just a grumpy guy who is bored quite humerous take him if you think you have what it takes not easy but the class is doable for an a very lenient on grading just show that hardworking and do reasonably well on the tests
5.0,M,he is very knowledgeable about a lot of things very good instructor be late i enjoyed having him
3.0,M,an ok teacher sometimes he scares the students he scares the students at first but as the semester goes on he becomes more lenient
5.0,M,an excellent prof always willing to go out of his way and assist students makes contract law interesting more of a philosophical approach will definitely take future classes with him
5.0,M,dr critelli is the best professor ever had should i be fortunate enough to achieve some success in life attribute some of it to dr critelli expanding my horizons if i could keep him as my professor change majors
5.0,M,love this man a lunatic and its awesome i stop by and sit in his class just for fun you the man critelli
5.0,M,critelli is out of this world make you laugh so hard you breathe critelli will go over the material over and over but in different hilarious ways i use to pretend i understand the reading so that he would explain it again and again because he made it so fun i would definitly take him again
1.0,M,i wouldnt call this a class because it is not really a class students basically teaching themselves weekly quizzes from questions at the end of the book exams are tough but he gives a great curve read the book or else you will struggle with the exmas
5.0,M,i think prof tim is a great instructor if u want to specialize in network security this is the class it is true that he students to correct the pp slides teach the class that is for students own advantage finally he curvers the class on the grade just do all the work attened all classes exams are tuff and quizses every day but don
1.5,M,a nice guy who seems to know his stuff however he doesnt teach it well at all trying to make students teach themselves by forming groups and make powerpoint presentations for the class however this format doesnt work you dont learn anything and his tests are impossibly hard take him if you can avoid it
4.0,M,i think a great teacher not unlike other teachers he is willing to make sure you understand the material and spends the time doing so with that said his class is not easy yes you have to work hard and read but in the end it is worth it if in for an easy a get someone else if you want to learn take tim hill
1.0,M,lazy teacher makes you teach the class when he is supposed to tests are beyond hard people getting with a curve skip him for every he will get fired soon
1.5,M,i took him both for and if you thought was bad you seen nothing yet it is the same exact format but more intense not recommended take another elective if you can
1.5,M,real nice guy but teach if his life depended on it i agree with the previous post that he is a really lazy teacher he does not teach the class and makes student teach the class you would think why you pay for the class if your only teaching yourself his test are extremely hard not recommended at all
1.0,M,i found this guy to be a very lazy teacher he is too lazy to lecture so he has you form teams to know your part of the section quizzes and test are hard the curve is not all that great because it dont boost your grade much not recommended at all take other professors if you can
4.5,M,good professor had a lot of group work that is all the class is you need to teach yourself because he will not lecture he will emphisise main points in your powerpoint presentations crazy ass curve for no quizes at all particiation is a must uses webct for that labs were fun and easy credit
3.5,M,wow this guy is a genious for real out his work or google really knows what he teaches but yeah a great teacher a lot of learning going on and he gives great ideas and him
5.0,M,aldridge is as well my all time favorite teacher key words predictable un-flaky cheerful helpful real this prof makes me fear using another teacher for my math courses he not only knows how to teach but he runs an understandable ship there are no surprises and the fact that he will go above the call of duty to help is evident da man
3.5,W,she is not horrible like everyone says she is very nice very intelligent and passionate about her field her tests are harder than usual because they are like the license exam but i quickly got the hang of them and did pretty well her project is long but not that hard when you get the hang of it you learn alot
2.0,W,she bases the grade on whether she likes u or not her tests are very tricky shes not approachable makes students feel stupid she makes her grad students grade her tests so double check ur grade the average grade she gives is a c so dont expect and a she gives back all ur tests the end so u go an entire semester not knowing where u stand
2.5,M,take this professor if you want to learn more more than the basics he gets very confused when he encounters any higher level concepts thus you be learning much from him i wish i had only attended the days before the exams where he gave us all the material in a nice and concise form otherwise the semester wasa complete waste
5.0,M,great teacher and an even better guy anyone who likes philosophy needs to take at least one of his classes
5.0,W,good prof explains things well also does a lot of inclass work to make sure you are ready for the exams two very long papers all stats have them but she is very helpful and proof reads them do it it makes a huge difference i enjoyed the class and learned a lot lot of work make sure other classes are easier to allow time for it
4.5,M,a great teacher with a dad type sense of humor even though pretty young his teaching skips around a bit during lecture but he makes it interesting enough that you can pretty much keep up if you get lost quick to guide you back on track attendance is a biggie with him and could be the difference of an b or a in his class
4.0,M,if you pay attention in class you will do good on the tests he takes his essays from the review he gives you and choses a select number for test he teached from the book which helps with not taking as many notes be prepared to work on the review sheets though because they are the outline for the test good professor overall
2.5,M,he is young and has a great personality the thing i like is he reads a lot of his personal notes and they skip around from years within eachother but overall he is a good teacher just a little unorganized
5.0,M,i love him as a professor he has a great sense of humor if you can take kinda groan laughs or very pop-culture types of jokes he gives the lesson and go every day and do fine if you slack off and pay attention mess yourself up so just pay attention and be gold really nice guy tall though
3.0,W,one of the most intelligent women i have ever met however never really met she just lectures to i listen
4.5,W,whatever--she is totally fair i got an a in one of her classes and an a in the other one time the ta gave me a and she raised it to an before i even saw the paper she can be dry but she has a great sense of humour--and face it brilliant
1.0,W,very interesting class she puts it all in an understandable historical context the art and the context takes precedence over memorizing lots of reading
4.5,W,great teacher her lectures can be long but she is very clear about the subject you dont have to buy the book she explains all the concepts that you are expected to know in class she made the class quite interesting recommended
4.5,W,she is a great teacher and you will learn a lot from her class work is very time consuming though so take an upper division class from her if you are not going to have a lot of time to put into the class make sure to do the weekly assignments because they make a difference in your final grade is always will to help you and go over things
4.0,M,he really is a walking knows so much about programming and design patterns and of course his compiler stuff his grading can give you a heart attack expect the worst or expect the not-expected and prepare to be surprised when you do check your grade in the end his material is hardcore be serious and do the work
5.0,W,she is a wonderful teacher very easy to talk to and ask for her help always smileying in class
5.0,W,really enthusiastic wicked friggen nice and a good teacher her tests can get pretty husky but thats to be expected in linear algebra
2.0,W,she was very hard on grading papers she showed favoritism and she was never any fun
3.5,M,thought the course was okay but somewhat boring we seemed to always discuss surface issues and not the real deep philosophical stuff jeff is a good scholar one of his articles was part of the syllabus and it was a great article but we really get into the theory behind it cultural reproduction could have been better
5.0,M,started off not liking the class ended up loving it and dr bieber we had some real in there and dr bieber was really patient with them even though we were not dr bieber seems like a hard core republican but he really is a bleeding heart liberal which i like great class and great instructor
1.0,M,the class is a does not cover the material in the text it is almost impossible to stay awake when he is you are a motivated student you can do well if you are not stay away from this course
4.5,M,great teacher very exams are mostly his you pay attention you could easily get a good grade
5.0,M,dr farmen quickly became one of my favorite professors he is so smart and will take time to help you his classes are not the easiest but they are challenging he is funny too one of the best
4.0,M,very good professor always willing to talk outside of class his exam was tough as expected but he gave us one of the essay questions in advance so that was more than fair his and multiple choice questions were tricky though
5.0,M,best prof ever he was a partner at cravath so he has a real understanding of business law if you are tired of the of other classes and the disconnect between what you learn in class and what do in practice you will love any class taught by widen exam is difficult but exactly what you expect no cheap tricks
1.5,M,professor is very smart but does not do a good job of conveying the information which he knows attendance really matter and you can get a good grade even without going to class but he expects you to know everything he covers relies heavily on the ucc very hard grader
3.0,M,very smart and def knows the material problem is teach it to you calls on students classmaster or takes volunteers but use socratic will expect you to answer your own questions bad choice for such a crucial subject a shame he is very smart and entertaining but the combo is wasted potential on
3.5,M,he makes the class very interesting and he is an easy grader great elective drugs and behavior and easy exams
1.0,W,not helpful wish i can say something nice about her
4.5,W,she gives very valuable constructive feedback if u ever needed it for an assignment or for practicum she tends to be quite a hard marker but a nice instructor nevertheless
3.0,W,she sometimes has no idea what she is talking about all she does is read off her powerpoint slide she is really nice and sweet but she cannot teach she is not very clear about what she is talking about and goes off topic the only thing i liked about her class were the chocolates she brought for the class and her easiness on extensions
4.0,W,sarah is one of the most excited and positive professors i have encountered though her classes seem a bit disorganized she is always willing to see students point of view shes a great person to work with outside of class-very helpful so nice
2.5,W,well the class was so easy mostly i took the same class in high school i never did the homework just sort of paid a little bit of attention and did fine the tests are exactly like the online review she puts up except that the numbers are different an easy a talk to her she will be more willing to help if she knows your name
4.5,W,i think she is a great teacher but i really felt i shouldnt have placed in in the first place total waste of time tests were easy got a so far she drops lowest test grade replaces it with a quiz average that stays out of no matter how many easy quizzes you take
4.0,M,not a difficult class but not the most exciting class either he is a good man with an interesting sense of humor although i find the material a bit dull it definetely is a good class to take if you want a low stress but educational class for bibical text
5.0,M,i took courses with fox this semester and i love both of them i learn a lot in his classes and he makes even the driest stuff interesting i definitely think anyone interested in history jewish studies or hgs should take at least once course with him
5.0,M,love him easy tester and grader nice guy a little dry but you learn a lot and he really is devoted to his students
4.5,W,dr cawthorne is the bomb diggity of a teacher she is extremely helpful and accommodating to those that are truly interested in learning she cares about her studeents

1.0,M,i had the worse experience with this professor out of all of my communication professors he explain his material and is very unclear on every wish i had known about this site before i took him because he is the worse and to add insult to injury he has the nerve to make us writ in apa style and he even know what it
2.0,M,this guy litterally borders on racism the entire semester we talked about stereotypes and i kept leaving class feeling like a lot of what i heard was how evil i am because white further he refuses to fully explain his assignments and he really explain anything very well at all
5.0,M,this is perhaps the most relevant class i took during the mba program he wants you to participate in the class so make sure you do the workload was reasonable the classes were enjoyable and he makes learning the material fun
5.0,M,took him a couple of years ago when i was doing my mba for strategy of the firm or something like that great teacher class was really enjoyable especially the mock business and the different teams that we were divided into earned an a and received an e-mail from him afterwards thanking me for my participation and work in the class
3.5,M,plays favorite so just ask him to the bar or stuff like that also if a hot girl easy a
5.0,W,prof giamptro is very sweet and personable as far as the class she really likes to cover all perspectives and is not bias at all she is very student-centered and she teaches in hope that you succede the course load is relatively easy she looks for insight and use of text in papers no tests also a very helpful advisor
5.0,W,professor giampetro is honestly the sweetest lady ever she gives a reasonable workload and is constantly there to help you listen to people that say she pushes propaganda and is bias she lets everyone in the class say what they feel and is willing to listen to all opinions take her if you can you regret it

5.0,W,i had her for the glass ceiling course i found her very well organized and she selected good readings she did not push her ideas on you but rather had you think about the subject matter and make your own decisions i would highly recommend this elective
3.0,M,heard this guy sucks via email but since i never tried i comment on that he told us he was brief though-almost as to forewarn us i though he went out of his way to help us understand this stuff actually we had extra tutorial sessions that he absolutely have to do--but did the final was tough but the semester he was fine
5.0,M,excellent teacher difficult subject but he is genuinely interested in seeing students succeed taken both calciii and diff eq with him curves tests and usually offers some form of extra credit
3.0,M,he is pretty strict excellent lecturer tho very into it hes sexy also hehe
4.0,M,nicest man in the world but wont listen to what you say if you have a reliable source gets off topic sometimes but because of all the class descussions we have only problem is that he mainly only teaches off of power point

1.0,M,brewbaker sucks boring make sense smart ass no good never ever recommend one of his classes i love healthcare law and he completely turned me off of it boo
2.0,M,starting using the casefile method which consisted of a treatise many property casefiles that were essentially long problems we were responsible for many pages in the treatise very hard to comprehend along with working out the casefiles prof brewbaker has great passion but lacks in his ability to bring his knowledge to the students

3.0,M,he works very fast if you pay attention quite easy to follow if you get distracted you miss his explanations and therefore are lost the problem sets were fair as were the midterm and the final the final was exactly like the practice exam allows formula sheets in the tests
1.5,M,wow he is useless left me confused after almost every lecture probably knows his stuff but teach at all his quiz questions are rediculously hard also the only way to get them is go to a tutorial he always asks the class if its ok and assumes that the silence means it probably it definately isnt ok
4.0,M,this guy is awesome to get an a in his class is soooo easy i mean it mean gonna learn much but an a is very possible also funny and cute oooops did i just say that sweet guy quite entertaining homework is mad short and easy u have a week to do problems extra credit

4.0,M,jim is extremely nice and understanding a great guy who really wants to make his class interesting those who took and feel he was unclear or stubborn are wrong his notes spell out what will be on the test he published study guides online and encourages discussion on the various topics in class he even let me make up a midterm
1.5,M,creating video games sounds cool not with this guy very disorganized very stuborn his test dont test knowledge cool guy but sucks as a teacher he came minutes late to our exam had another exam a week before our project was due and wouldnt push it back becuase he wanted to demo the video game for the last few classes
1.0,M,i have to agree with the others it was the easiest a that i ever made but if you want to really know the material then you are out of luck he is the only one who teaches the forensic accounting class
5.0,M,i had him for molecular evolution bioinformatics and i have to say i was impressed he spoke about genetics and evolution with the greatest of ease pretty good for a cs professor excellent professor
5.0,W,she is difficult but you will learn a lot she was very enthusiastic about biochemistry initially she is intimidating but once you ask her for help she will do everything to help you succeed i would recommend her to anyone but be prepared to work hard
4.0,M,he may seem a bit off topic and pointless at times but he truely is a proffessor that lets the class do the teaching he guides the conversations and discussions at times at times does not if the people are good the class is good if not well blame the professor just read the book do the assignments and participate in class
2.0,M,i took his class for an easy a i have a background in finance as my family has been in different financial and investment fields for decades it was an easy class if you agree with him as a licsenced broker with years of experience i disagreed with some of the things he said it a boring class though
2.0,W,she is incredibly moody and unfriendly to some graduate students for whatever reason if you are not her favorite she will not smile when she sees you and if she is knowledgeable or an in your face feminist then she needs to be more friendly so that students will want to find out what she is all about i want to study with her
4.0,W,fitch is quite knowledgable get on her good side and pay attention to details go to section write your papers very straight forward those are graded by your ta so suck up to them

4.5,W,kristine really knows what she is talking about in communication studies she does a good job at giving a brief overview of all the basic important topics in comm studies but also does a good job of making sure people understand them tests very hard and if you are able to take the honors section the best way to go
1.5,W,its mostly commonsense and she even makes that boring unfortunatly you have to take this to get in the major but she sucks
5.0,M,always has a joke to tell but wants you to learn and understand what teaching you so a nice balance of work of play he explains things clearly and uses great examples to help you understand awesome professor
3.5,W,she has good teaching techniques but if you have problems memorizing information this is definatley not the class for you granted i am doing well in the class but its all from guessing pretty much alot of the material contains material from recent chapters the art activities are great though
5.0,M,has to be one of the best can hist profs at york very easy going great lectures really intellegent knows his history in an out willing to help even outside of class follow university protocol which makes it even easier to work with him loved the class and great prof
3.5,M,a very intelligent man within his field of study not the best lecturer he seems somewhat out of touch with the modern university system he has an amusing tendency to glorify himself within his lectures
4.5,M,his classes are highly reccommend to get in touch with though sometimes keep to e-mails
3.0,W,she explained things well but her tests were very hard there is a lot of material to cover in the class no matter who teaches it her final was comprehensive which made it very difficult considering the amount of information you learn in the calss
5.0,W,her class is very interesting she has funny examples and encourages class participation she has a down-to-earth approach not a proff that acts like she knows all the answers a breath of fresh air i would recommend her give any assignments just exams
4.0,M,fair grader goes into great detail on every subject take notes and tests will be no problem his personality can be tough to handle for long periods of time
2.5,M,professor v is a little boring and solely lectures the class and once in a while picks a person out to answer a question on the spot however he is very fair he always rounds up he definitely does not move too fast every class begins with a review of the last class
5.0,W,by using a mix of humour julie turned a terribly dry and boring subject into a fun and informing class she is the best professor i have ever had im just mad she doesnt teach year
4.0,W,she is the nicest person ever if you have to talk to her about anything but she does get lost in her lectures sometimes i would take her again for another class because she bad the tests were straight forward and the papers were very reasonable she is real strict on attendance and takes it everyday twice a day
5.0,W,she is the nicest person that anyone would ever meet in this world the work is easy all you have to do is read poems and write responses for them you get a couple of major papers but all that matters is the grammar and not so much the content but if you are completely off subject in everything you write your grade might suffer
4.5,M,amazing guy class is fairly easy and he is extremely nice and knowledgeable take him at every chance you have
4.5,W,vida was an amazing professor to have for a tutorial although she was quite demanding she was very helpful and interesting and usually very clear in her asignments and grading

5.0,M,easily one of the best teachers ever had very clear helpful and knows his stuff nice guy
1.5,M,his knowledge of the subject is extensive dr never tried to implement dialogue in the class setting in semester he was between minutes late to every lecture without exception which in a min class leaves no time other than straight lecture furthermore his ta for labs english language skills was not sufficient
5.0,W,great teacher her online course was to the point and she graded very fairly this was my first online course i have ever taken and i got an a i enjoyed having her as a teacher
4.0,M,extremely helpful intelligent and nice professor makes himself readily available almost any time during business hours if he have a class or meeting the problem is that very difficult and his expectations are unrealistic especially for non-science majors if a bio major recommend him otherwise say no
5.0,M,listen to the bad reviews tudor really is the best teacher for he is a very nice guy and very approachable which many of the bio professors at sju the and everything else are run by the bio dept not the individual teachers so they are the same in all the sections the best of them by far
5.0,W,so much stiumlating info on teaching a better teacher because of her she goes the extra mile but expects a lot from you

1.5,M,a boring teacher believe me with absolutely no gift to teach anything he is one of the worst teacher ever and can even makes the most interesting subject into a thing you hear about anymore by the way he is a specialist at giving you critical information at the last moment like the place of an exam hours before it

4.5,M,no joke i developed a crush on him because he was so passionate about his work his students and the environment awesome guy wow i actually miss attending his lectures
1.0,M,i didnt like him i think is was very boring grented it was math but still
5.0,M,lost the boat with the physics too much physics stop it with the drawings take class if you like to tackle engineering projects do not take class if you have any form of sanity whatsoever not a math class and do not learn much however he knows how to teach and for the right student well done

3.0,W,shes nice but a complete space cadet who goes off on tangents all the time her tests are hard and she grades harshly but she curves at the end which is good the class is soooo boring i wouldnt reccommed it unless u are actually interested in it
2.5,W,had her for lady loves what she lectures tedious work assigned essay tests must read text in order to do well in this class goes on tangents most of the is recommend this class
5.0,W,this class is easy she explains computer assignments using a program known as spss in easy to follow steps good attendance is a must cause a lot of the lecture material as well as class readings ends up on essay exams if you take the optional final your lowest grade is dropped your lowest computer hw grade is dropped
1.0,M,do this to yourself seriously a horrible teacher absolutely horrible he gets mad when students ask questions and he disgards questions most of the time he is so lost on what teaching he def will not help at all
1.5,M,i have no idea why math teachers keep getting more and more ridiculous this professor is very hard to understand and at random points during his lecture runs of in tangents about other things he is fast paced and due to the difficult dragging lectures which i left feeling stupider if anything i reluctantly decided to theclass not happy
2.0,M,this professor was incredibly boring while teaching the class he talks to the you can only understand every other word believe me if have a hard time with prof is def not the prof for you
1.0,M,worst professor ever he speaks to the board mumbles makes mistakes often explain things to the class gets frustrated when asked questions barely speaks english horrible despite all of that the only reason i got an a was because it was easy math but going to class made me want to hurl an eraser at his head
1.0,M,i went twice and got an a as long as you do the hw you will be fine and the math is a joke however the two times that i did go i wanted to jump out the window he is awful he mumbles speaks awful english and gets frustrated after the second question but take the class for the easy credit trust me
4.0,M,okay he gives you many opportunities to raise your grade if you do your work you will probably do fine
4.5,M,really into books a little eccentric but a great professor all about the deeper meaning in books so be ready to actually do the reading cliff and spark notes help you in his class a tough grader especially on essays but take solace in the fact that he lets you know what he wants so it be a surprise
5.0,M,great guy always willing to help would love to have him again
5.0,M,prof simmonds is the best he makes class interesting and fun i got a b from him and i hate english i would recommend anyone to take him if you like english
1.0,W,this professor definatly shows favoritism blatently if you do not agree with her may i suggest you bite your tongue she will earmark you for failure and never let you live it down she is very scattered in her lectures and pulls test questions out of thin air then she marks answers wrong on the test when the book says the answer is correct
4.5,M,whoa he talks a lot watch out people get lots of daydreams ready cause he will talk your friggin ear off
3.5,W,dr newhart is a wonderful lady but this course is a bore a lot of busy work and class can get boring very fast she is a sweet lady though and sometimes can be fun she laughs about a lot of class participation but none of the material is that hard to grasp if you do the homework or at least some of it
3.0,W,i am not a fan of dr newhart at all as interested as she is in philosophy and as knowlegeable as she is about the subject she does not know how to express it to her students without giggling a lot at her own jokes i have to take notes hardcore when she teaches because her lectures do not sink in at all
5.0,W,dr newhart is a hoot she makes class so interesting helps you learn in many aspects so a tricky subject is very understandable very easy grading on all work and will tell you where you need to improve easy to talk to very understanding lady plenty of energy but fun
3.0,W,easy class as long as you dont mind to write about page papers and big papers no tests or homework other than the papers shes def out there though dont count on learning anything in class shes in her own world
4.0,W,great teacher really knows her stuff very energetic and seems genuinely happy to be teaching communication if you go to class and take notes the exams should be no problem and she sends out studying guides she gives you chances to ask questions and talk to her about things you dont understand i definately recommend her
5.0,W,great teacher very energetic she only has tests but good if you come to class and pay attention and take notes be fine
4.0,M,text sucked for this the professor is extremely is not the best lecturer but if you go upto him he explains really is a very nice guy

3.0,M,this man is the most self-absorbing egotistical self-impressed individual i have met in a very very long time needs to check his manners in regard to condensending over-tones in class toward students thankfully i did well in this class obviously did not care for his teaching style nor his mannerisms toward students
4.5,W,shes a pretty good teacher a little boring but easy and she tries so hard to be funny
1.5,W,this teacher is highly unfair she took off points because i rounded to this teacher also takes points off for not erasing something completely or having something crossed out on the page i highly recommend that you avoid this class at all costs definetly not worth it worst professor had so far at ccsu i hate her
1.0,W,my little sister could pass the course on the material but i think she took off points for spelling my name wrong again she tooks off points for correctly answering the question as explained in the book but not as she explained in class the book must have been when has pie been a ing variable makes grade math confusing
4.0,W,crazy but it makes the class more exciting best math teacher had since grade she does take off a lot of points if things written the way she likes but she warns you about it beforehand class went by quickly and lets you out early most of the time good person
2.0,W,its grade work that we did but her grading system is terrible you get points off because youre not putting all the equal signs the way she wants it or your work is messy or overly erased or not placed under the original example when you should get you end up getting like a because of all the extra points she takes off yack
1.0,W,this teacher sucks so bad i would run away if you are thinking about taking her she is ing retarded wont help you and grading system is completely unfair do yourself a favor and dont take her ever
1.0,W,ok i dont know if i should write something but i sat in her class just for the first day and dropped it she presented the class as if we were in elementary school and frightened me the work load appeared to be too hard for a level class and so i just wanted to warn people before they jumped head first into that classroom good luck
1.5,W,horrible avoid taking this teacher at all costs she will help you but it doesnt matter because she doesnt know how to teach anyways

4.0,M,i took douglass and spraul-schmidt for the first two quarters but cebula for the part of history sequence i did the best in his class and felt i learned the most multiple choice quizzes arent bad if u read essay exams are challenging but just know major points of the chapters i ended up getting a b in his class decent amount of effort
4.5,M,been a few years so see if his policy is still the same a quiz each chapter no midterm get an a average on the quizes and use that in place of the final a long paper best class participation ever since quizes mean so much everyone reads and is prepared for class i been in a class since where i felt everyone took in so much

1.0,M,guaranteed to be the worst professor i have ever had in semesters of college not only is he ignorant to the beliefs of many of his students while making fun of those beliefs on top of all of this he will admit to being wrong on a test question and still will not give you the points for it any questions please contact jim in the computer lab
5.0,M,yes he is very cute gentleman he cares his students even when he no longer teach them
2.5,W,dr zlokovich i refuse to call her dr z is unhelpful disinterested in the lives of her students and on the verge of spiteful her tests have questions not covered in lectures the answers are buried somewhere in the pages of text each test covers take her class if already stuck with her just go to class and read the book
1.0,W,no extra credit she is pretty cold hearted when it comes to making up work no true class involvement although we had a couple of quick partner projects most of the work is busy work that support the material her lectures were dry and uninteresting if you get a class that uses a remote control for answers i recommend you drop it
1.5,W,she was a terrible teacher if you call her mrs instead of dr she chews you out she would post our questions online only hours before class she was not willing to help anyone with anything i would avoid her if at all possible
4.0,W,i thought she was a great teacher she really knows her material and uses a lot of examples to make it easier to understand the class does require work on the students part and going to class because of participation points and a few short quizs at the beginning of class make sure you do the main points and listen to lecture and youll be fin
3.0,W,dr z is a smart woman and her class is interesting but there is a ton of reading to prepare for the tests and quizzes quizzes are like every class meeting she will get pissed if you refer to her as dr z or dr zlokovich i recommend her
3.5,W,dr z is a very sophisticated professor her lectures are pretty good and interesting but her tests have nothing to do with her notes so you have to read the book very well also a lot of points are based on attendence
3.0,W,the worst teacher i ever had i got an a in the class because i was very interested in it she is kind of distant but can be nice if she knows you are trying
5.0,W,she not as bad as everyone says she is strict but the class that hard you have to read the book but the lectures bad you do have to show up for class bc she gives quizzes and participation pts her tests too bad she just uses sophisticated wording so as long as you can decode the wording the test is really not bad
2.0,M,very boring teacher and really care about his students if you go to class and get your perticipation points and do the online assisgnments your get a b or c in the class the test are pretty hard and confussing though
5.0,M,best professor ever even had our class over to his house for dinner
4.0,M,automatic extensions for homework assignments and open note lectures are pretty clear and is always willing to help tries his best to get the class involved during the lecture
5.0,M,i only took this class to get rid of a requirement but professor arvo made the class interesting also a really nice guy who printed out notes for everybody who came to class the notes are so good you probably have to go to class but his lectures make life eaasier on you
1.0,W,she assumes you already know everything therefore her teaching skills suck
5.0,W,an awesome teacher going to her classes and very knowledgeable in the childhood field
5.0,W,an awesome teacher and is really good especially when reading books to us she makes great sound effects too as she reads them the text is quite difficult to understand however so make sure u keep on top of it out of all the classes the text is an in-depth analysis about acquiring language it tends to be hardtoretain
3.5,W,thehistoryofearlychildhoodandcareshepracticallyhas all her material memorized at times she speaks a little sometimes i found her language to be incoherent just because she tends to use a lot of sophisticated vocabulary both when shelectures andalso
5.0,M,teacher that cares about his students very organized almost obsessed about it but a good thing because his lectures are organized but u may have to record his lectures because he gives so much info n leaves no time for daydreaming if u blank out for minute u are lost in space
5.0,M,rose is sweet and an awsome teacher he cares about the success of his students i was nervous about this class since i took it in the summer my doubts were unnecessary though the class was hard i learned alot and managed a b i would recomend him in a heartbeat
5.0,W,she was such a fun instructor we did a lot of hands on activities which helped us with our practicums relatively leanient about assignments ie extend dates if u have a valid enough reason she almost always has a smile on her face which makes the classes so much more her exams are pretty
5.0,M,pretty easy class if you either understand it or do some studying very helpful teacher and he makes science interesting
1.0,M,ok he hardly shows up for class all he does it babble on about politics and hardly mentions anything that actually supposed to be talking about one day he just let everyone out about himself awkward i think he enjoyed the way too much easiest a anyone will ever get
3.0,M,dibble is a little weird and starts going off on tangents a lot but when it comes to getting an easy a or b you beat dibble just put your political views off to the side in his class
5.0,M,rob really cares about his students and their success he is interesting and knows what he is talking about
5.0,M,this was a great professor he was fun and always kept the class going i learned a lot from him
4.5,M,he tells you exactly what is going to be on the tests and what to study very nice and helpful his grading scale is very generous easy a
1.0,M,overbearingly rude and thinks cute he is very harsh and views himself as merely demanding the actual material and class is pathetically easy but he tests over inane details and is rude to any students with questions even intelligent and well thought-out questions usually result in him announcing to the class that you have wasted his time
4.0,M,ed is a good man but he can put people off sometimes he says or does things sometimes he uses a tone sometimes he makes people feel stupid when they necessarily deserve it if quick and mind sarcasm or if you can fire one back cause he can take it then you will get along with ed if not then perhaps reconsider
5.0,M,craig loves photography and loves to teach it he gives out weekly assignments but typically easy always a joy in class and teaches tips and tricks in photoshop that most people know been using photoshop since version take digital imaging from him much more experienced than others teaching it
5.0,M,class is kind of hard but professor sloan is the best i never thought i would ever get html or any kind of coding or techie software before this class learning alot very quickly he knows quite a bit about everything recommend taking him if you take this class i heard he is the best emac teacher too
5.0,M,awesomeness jason is amazing and very very nice guy and very intelligent he made what could have been a difficult class fun
5.0,M,great teacher dude knows a lot of stuff very technical course but he makes it interesting looking forward to later in the semester when we can be a bit more creative very helpful i was not getting a lot of the html stuff and he came in late on a friday afternoon to spend an hour and a half to help and i finally got it not too many teache
1.0,W,she teach and she speak english her tests are very difficult i fix computers for a living and her tests are even hard for me i think she is russian qcc should hire translator for her lol she is really a math professor and teach computer scince i feel sorry for her math students am thinking of dropping her
1.0,W,this professor needs to learn how to speak english lol you will have tough time understanding her she is also said she will send students to the dean for talking if it is about students use teach comp science i can feel sorry for her math students classisnothard she is
3.0,W,this class is not meant for the century i feel like i already know more about computers than this professor does she doe not speak english well and is mad boring the class is a joke one of her classes got cancelled because noone wants to register for her class she does not seem like a computer expert extremelly boring
4.5,W,learned alot in her class when she said what you learn in speech class will help later in life ie job-related and just plain communicating with people she meant it didnt care for public speaking before her class now i wonder what the fuss was about she made it simple great teacher but tough condescending at times but means well
5.0,M,by far one of the more interesting and intelligent professors i have ever had he is passionate about teaching and his energy is contageous would take any class he offers great as a teacher and great to just talk to about anything highly recommend
5.0,M,very cool and understanding would recommend him anytime also quite a hottie
3.0,W,she is a hard grader but you will most likely get a b not below so if you are border line and really want to stress out with hard reading and writing take her class for that english honors minor nonetheless if you want to do really well just focus on writing about what she is asking you and do not summarize the movie i am serious
4.5,W,she is a hard grader always had high grade in writting until her class but if you want to graduate with an english honors minor all you need to do is take film classes she gave me a b she gives essays and you basically just sit back and whatch movies
3.0,W,the films are okay her writing is hard to rd and shes weird about how she grades
5.0,M,this is a man of striking brilliance if you are looking for an intellectual challenge definitely take his class course requirements are pretty easy there was no final exam just writing comments on assigned readings all on his website and a paper
5.0,W,dont need to study for that class you come sit get an a your brain is not worked at all if looking just to get an a in foreign language requirements take fre and with her easy a
4.5,W,in the beginning of the course find her difficult but when u r of great have just final and some gives homeworks but they are damn easy and was great and i took her back to back for her for an easy a
4.5,W,i think she is a good professor just more board work is needed
2.0,W,while passing the class with an a is pretty simple as long as you pass all the simple requirments its pretty much a fend for yourself atmotsphere if your really in the class to learn the prof picks favorites and not-so-favorites but she shows movies and the homeworks a cinch
1.5,M,he is a kind old fellow but sometimes gets lost in mid thought he goes off on more tangents than my grandma with alzhiemers but many of his tangentsa are interesting an informative he trys hard to get students to think independently and i like that although he is a pessimist at heart i thought he robbed me on my grade but he did not agre
4.0,M,the real deal he occasionally misses class because he has been flown to dangerour wartorn parts of the world where his expertise is required he once had to leave early to catch a flight but was enjoying the class discussion when a student reminded him he had a flight to catch he said ok a military flight wait
1.0,M,keep away this man is boring miserable and sucks at grading he weill lose your work and hand it back until it is too late to drop the course i almost left john jay because of him if i had to i would skip a semester just so i have to take him again poor excuse for a professor or therapist
1.5,M,very boring and is ridiculous in grading papers basically if you want an a on a paper you have to dumb down your writing if you write a paper that sounds like it came out of a real psychology journal ie a good paper then he like it the text is written by him and seems to be written for a grader
5.0,M,he has a hot british accent that makes you want to listen to anything he says he is quite droolworthy
5.0,M,i have had todd as a professor on and off for years now and he is a great guy you can learn a lot from him and he is always there to help students with anything he is charismatic and his classes are not hard they just rely on a lot of theory and experience as opposed to textbook facts he really knows what teaching
4.0,M,sorry but i know off-hand what the course number is the guy is full of himself easy to do well in his class since the only thing that he really cares about is if you can give his own words and thoughts back to him comes off as a nice guy but his ego is taller than he is
5.0,M,attendance is very important in his class there is one midterm and final exam very easy multiple choice if you read the book you will get an easy a in that class cause the exam is related to the book gives quizzes in class but they are few questions and he lets you use the book so its open quiz come to class and easy grade no papers either
5.0,M,imagine ichabod crane with a nice wardrobe about what prof crozier looks like in some weird way incredibly charming and the humane learnedness another reviewer mentioned adds to his appeal that and the fact that there are very few people on this planet from whom you can learn more
5.0,W,shes good those people who said her class is hard dont know what they are talking about its easy all you have to do is read she gives quizzes every week on the reading a paper for a midterm and a final which is comparing and contrasting the characters from the books she assigned shes is about doing your work
3.0,W,she is a nice person but her class is difficult esp with the readings she asks distinctive questions as you will have to know every single detail her quizes kills your grades and gets too emotional with her books she is often late for her classes and gives quizzes every also has favorites in the class so she is not fair to new ones
1.5,W,hard class lots of reading boring lit too quiz every week with confusing questions and a page paper at the end and a essay in class final crazy wierd prof aviod her if you can she is a sweetheart but her class is just too hard and boring
5.0,M,he opened my mind and then stretched it now i am a different person prof amdur is a wonderful teacher and mentor
5.0,W,hilary is a great instructor with the ability to keep her students awake irrespective of the arguably dry nature of statistics she provides real-world examples that form a connection and enhance learning and recall she gets to the meat of the matter without superfluous garbage that you will likely never see again do not be afraid of stats
3.5,W,she asks for too much the whole class complained about her everyday she is nice but answers very sarcastically when you ask her a question i recommend her unless you want to stress
2.0,M,one of those professors who will either love or despise you if he loves you if you tolerate his odd mannerisms laugh at his jokes to feed his ego you coast if not he will jokingly single you out in class and start arguments with you that end with you looking like a fool considers himself brilliant constantly references his own work
4.0,W,one of the best teachers at gmc she will do anything to help you succeed in life my favorite professor
5.0,W,dr long is an amazing scholar and poet her classes are stimulating but she hold your hand through them if you show up for class or turn in your assignments you probably be nannied but you will fail the course if self-motivated responsible and ready for mind-expanding feminism sign up with dr long
1.0,W,omg how can anyone say they liked this teacher i went to her class everyday did the work went to the meetings about my page paper and still got a c in her a bia
5.0,W,dr long is hard and she has no tolerance for fools at all but if your willing to work you can learn a lot from her she actually made me a better writer which is something years of public school and previous english professors failed to do also kinda sexy especially when she smiles after making a off-color joke
1.0,W,she didnt get any fing help from her at all
5.0,M,i enjoyed going to this class every week he really makes you think and everyones opinion matters
5.0,M,he really makes you think i loved the class you have to speak up and participate and do your journals and its an automatic a
1.5,M,omg what can i say horrible teacher its bad enough that he know how to teach but when he does teach wrong also what he calls cutting edge new and revolutionary has been around for um years good job jkeating keep wasting our precious money sigh i was looking forward to an e-commerce class
5.0,W,i love dr craig she makes ethics fun however the most help she has even given me is by being my mentor she wrote an amazing rec letter for me for grad school and has helped and encouraged me to do my best i can talk to her about anything and i learned this by traveling with her during j-term she is very caring funny and kind
3.5,M,mentally the best prof i have ever had he pushed my mind to new creative levels love him if you open your mind to him you can only gain
5.0,W,one of the nicest people ever never gets angry and is quite knowledged in the subject matter she is very helpful and even though i am horrible at math i passed with an s you will not regret taking her
1.0,M,arrogant ocd personality he guards the passing of a thesis for his pick of students he can be very when sitting on a thesis board he believes that his view of things is the only way his comments really hurt
4.0,W,lots of reading but if you pay attention the class too bad when i took it she let anyone who had above an not take the final so my entire grade was from two point quizes a point midterm and a point essay
4.0,W,a good professor and she makes the topics interesting she teaches from power point a lot but it works for her there is a lot of focus on homosexuals and the class is a little more interesting when you can relate it to yourself a lot of reading but it can be a pretty easy a
3.0,M,frederick is exactly what i expected in a philosophy professor he takes long drawn out pauses in mid-sentence while he stares into the distance he speaks in a similar drawn-out tone and he will ponder minutiae until the end of time overall a pretty decent professor not terribly easy not terribly difficult just decent
5.0,M,kaufmans great really interested in his students and really passionate about his work smart and fair if you like philosophy like him
5.0,W,yeah you have to ork but very helpful she knows her stuff
3.0,M,the reading assignments were ridiculously long and a lot of them were very dry but after the first few classes you realized that he gives a synopsis of the assignment every day so you really have to read them all very popular during office hours so get therer early and be prepared to wait
1.5,M,try to take copper for this class instead because he know how he wants to teach his class
4.5,M,dr colcord is a real nice guy and his class in general is pretty easy his tests and exams are awesome as he has a curve which saved me on both of them you can get away with not going to class some of the time but id go days out out of the three always there to help you out
4.5,W,this was my favorite class last semester i think the reason it was so easy for me was because i was generally interested in what i was learning she gave the option of using our quiz grades in place of a final so i studied a lot for every one and got an a i love the notes being on webct too just an awesome class all around she is so nice
4.0,W,i honestly felt like i was in elementary school all her quizzes were questions and multiple choice all her notes are on webct the material is easy to begin with but ivy makes it so a year old could pass with flying colors easiest a ive ever gotten although the class is soooo easy ivy is also a genuinely sweet individual
3.0,M,require you to think the way he thinks and sometimes quite difficult to see what getting at he never uses the assigned text and his lecture slides are often unclear and loaded with mathematical jargon he makes up for all this with a very generous grading scale that makes it almost impossible to get anything less than a b
5.0,M,great professor lots of extra credit and he gives all the questions to the test the class before
1.0,M,terrible teacher hard to understand and makes it a point to single out students for his own amusement i would not reccomend him unless you are from nepaul like him
2.5,M,study the study guides they are the test and the ticket to an a hard to understand because of his accent but the class that tough
4.5,W,such a sweetheart some of her assignments were a little tedious but overall i loved this course i thought that the service learning volunteering she makes us do would have been a pain but it actually helped me find out what i want to major in premedicine dr chirico is great
4.0,W,very good teacher even though she is a little into man-bashing i would advise anyone to take her classes as she is a very fair and intellingent instructor
3.0,W,could this class be any more depressing everyday i go and learn about how horrible the united states is in the world and all the dozens and dozens of things that are wiping out babies everyday a day pass that she warn of world war iii which will be about drinking water save your aquafina
5.0,W,very clear and very helpful there is no way that you will get a bad grade or a failing grade she makes math fun
3.5,M,class was kinda tough higher level engineering math but he did pretty well teaching a lot of his own problems for homework does some things that in the book great guy makes jokes all class he really gets into what teaching which helps with learning even if you really understand it
5.0,M,great excellent pictures good use of always willing to answer says no to copy his note off the board whisper copy everything is helpful with assignments and keep you paying attention the midterm and finals were fair you study then you fail great first year proff
5.0,M,is such a great that everybody wrote about him is true and then is such a caring person and really wants you to do was very lucky to have him as my math you have any questions he will be more than happy to answer always makes time for his students definately take him if you can
1.0,M,sooooo happy that he got fired
1.0,M,wow he sucks in many ways
3.0,W,kinda boring lectures are pretty dry and uninteresting her tests are harder than they should easy to get a to get an a not one of the better professors at niu
3.5,W,i think she may have changed her course bc u need the book now to do some of her hw class easy a and you have to go to get the notes and attendance points shes an ok teacher but subject is really boring and dry tests are kinda an easy b but def not a unless you know this subject well
5.0,M,very patient will re-explain himself until he is sure you understand what he is trying to teach
4.0,M,this crazy classroom antics and enthusiasm for the subject by themselves make any class with him worth taking he knows his stuff about mechanisms he absolutely loves teaching this subject and it shows also really lenient on homework grading he can throw some curveballs on tests
5.0,W,madison is awesome with a capital a at first she does appear snobby and she seems intimidating but she at all those are just first impressions she is just a genius adn knows everything about edith wharton scary impressive her class is fun you learn a lot and the most helpful prof ever had
5.0,W,madison is very helpful and very clear this can be witnessed by her following of students who take all of her classe class is like a book club with very informal discussions she comes across as hard-nosed though she is not that harsh she expects quality work but prepares you thoroughly for all exams comes across a bit snobby at times
4.0,M,i liked his class because he gives a lot of examples he take attendance but going to class will definetly help you pass the tests he uses slides they are available for you to print very helpful when you study we had tests so gives you a better chace for a good grade i think it was boring material i would take him again
2.0,M,boring and doesnt really put effort into his teaching very unprofessional falls asleep himself a lot easy but if you actually are interested and want to learn then you will be dissapointed
3.0,M,a nice enough guy but he seem very smart at all very tough grader-takes off different points for different class i do not recommend him
5.0,W,cares about students easy class yes but she took it way too seriously this course is unnecessary for anyone with work experience the whole ordeal felt overly perky and forced
1.0,M,i heard that he was a good teacher so i decided to take his class for a fun summer course bad mistake unless you are really good at trivial persuit tests are rediculously hard and is very bias when it comes to your grade and if he likes you
5.0,M,sexy boy killer skies was one of the best classes taken looney kept me excited for class and did presentations effectively and with great humor highly recommend him in general online quizzes were tough but given multiple chances exams are somewhat hard so study never a dry moment great guy great topics gonna have fun ciao
4.0,M,loved his killer skies class very funny and allows you to bring in a sheet of notes for each test and even the final theres no textbook but you have to use his ppt slides alot for the hw and cheat sheets the hw is quite hard tho even with the ppt slides given to you but you get unlimited number of tries and the highest score is taken
4.0,W,trouble is if you have different opinions on the topics you talk about then she like you as long as you stick to what she lays out you should be good she wants very badly to have students she molds if she mold you throw you away
4.5,W,jans is wonderful her teaching methods are some of the best that i have experienced there is a good deal of time involved in the course but if you like film criticism you mind though the subject ended up not being my cup of tea i still enjoyed going to class and doing the assignments
5.0,M,take this class bryan is the man do the reading and the assignments and study for midterm and final and be fine half is linguistics which might be difficult for some but he explains it well work on your language creation project throughout the semester great class i loved class discussions and he includes everyone take it
3.0,W,lots of reading does give a review sheet but exams are not easy if you read the have to spread to groups every class and discuss the you hate reading or group discussions take her class
3.0,W,ms campos is nice and does the best she can with teaching however she is highly scatterbrained and changed the course work dates without notifying the class her tests are medium-hard and web sam takes forever
3.5,W,personally i think she makes the class too easy if you know spanish or care to learn waste her time already pointed that out to some students
1.5,W,a very nice lady but difficult to understand and unclear about expectations our was useless and there is no class participation required something mandatory if you actually want to learn people misbehave like children you can definitely phone-in this class but just try to be clear about the due dates because she
5.0,W,shes a great teacher shes very helpful and maker sure you understand the material i would take another class with her again
2.0,W,sweet lady she should have been a writer not a good teacher i learn anything at all very easy but very repitative and mundane work boring class
4.5,W,excellent course though would have preferred if it been combined with her enthusiasm is contagious sometimes too much powerpoint but she is an awesome professor overall i learned a lot and earned an a she is very clear about her expectations follow her guidelines and be just fine
5.0,W,great professor she turns an intimidating class into one that you might actually look forward to great classroom environment she is incredibly helpful and a great person but she does have her rules about attendance format etc if you do all the work and pay attention to detail you can pass even if your speeches great take her
3.0,M,i studied more for this one class than all my classes combined and i am a pharmacy major i received the highest grades on the midterm and final out of people in the class and he still gave me a b how does anyone get an a im glad i heard he left or hopefully fired he does not care about the students yet about boosting his ego
5.0,M,this guy is an absolute amazing professor he taught the subject so well and i learned more in one day of his lecture then a whole term with walker the best o chem professor at osu but not the easiest
4.0,M,overall a good teacher he does notes via chalkboard though and post slides on blackboard so basically you have to go to class people say that he crams you with mechanism information but that is what o-chem is chemical mechanisms i thought he did a very good job teaching difficult material definitely buy the book though
3.5,M,good teacher attend class and take good notes im pretty sure he drinks red bulls before lecture he during lecture
2.5,M,as far as his teaching ability goes it is not too bad dr carter is very experienced in the field however his requirements are ridiculous asks direct questions from previous terms it is extremely hard to even pass the class i do not recommend him
5.0,M,i did terrible in organic chemistry the first time i took the course i took it again with dr carter and i got an a mechanisms are a huge part of he always asked students if he needed to slow down and no one spoke up he was always willing to help and made it interesting best organic chemistry professor take his class
2.0,M,he thinks cramming a whole bunch of mechanisms is the way of learning o-chem lack of clear explanation and talks in light speed he grades hard too not recommended
2.0,M,first d ever received worked hard but his use of blackboard and no lecture notes killed me by the time i was done copying off the board he had explained the concept and moved on to the next one took myles the next term and got a b
4.5,M,professor carter is a great professor if willing to work hard lectures consist mostly of taking notes as dr carter writes them on the board but occasionally he will tell stories related to what teaching very consistent in making sure that if we learn something one way he tests us that way great professor and very helpful
4.5,W,very good teacher took her class on-line while deployed and was very understanding and helpful with my situation went out of her way to help out
1.0,M,worst math teacher possible he was lazy his class was absolutely useless if you have a question about the math even try he constantly gets off topic and brings up things that have nothing to do with math usually sports or cars the subject is hard enough for most of us without him complicating it take him
1.5,M,he is incomprehensible and pretty lazy he has someone make out his notes and then gets confused by them he was pretty funny only because he would talk about completely useless things such as golfing so if you take him please learn your book will be your best friend
1.0,M,he is the worst teacher i have ever had he is unbelievably unorganized and his teacheing style is beyond confusing i had already learned all we did in class and needed a refresher but he taught it in a way that made it confusing and completely messed me up he hates to teach and that is apparent in his lectures do not take him
2.0,M,is very confusing and loses himself when lecturing he does not explain things well and then when he goes over a test he tells you little tricks you can use which he should tell you when he is explaining how to do the math problems talks alot in class about tangent things that do not apply to math like how hot the cashier that waited on him
3.0,M,i liked him
1.0,W,she has no interpersonal skills at all
3.0,W,she is really nice and keeps class interesting answers all your questions gives you homework first day and it is all due by the end of the semester its okay to miss class
1.0,M,he is a very mediocre teacher and seem to interact well with other students he acts like political science is hard when it really
1.0,M,i would have to agree with the comments below he is really ineffective and rigid not very personable either i would try to avoid him
1.0,M,one of the worst teachers at denison he is very arrogant and really needs to retire
3.0,M,pletcher is a brilliant professor but i look forward to his class he runs our freshman seminar like a posc he also read student essays only accept re-writes and averages the two grades overall interesting guy but demanding all around with some ineffective policies
3.0,M,this is not an easy class one should not expect to walk in and ace it you will never use a textbook in his class which is nice instead you use small-large books the class is a study of philosophical ideas and how they can be applied to morality in daily life your grade is mostly comprised of two papers and tests tests easy papers not
2.5,M,do not take this guy failing so had to withdraw should have looked on here before very hard class he is not clear whatsoever on what he says and it only gets harder do not take him
2.0,M,ethics not very ethical unable to make office hours had a mandatory attendance class at the same time despite this i did see panos a few times so he could review my essays i followed his recommendations exactly and still got a c win
3.0,M,i did not elect to seek panos in his office hours mainly because i had classes during all of his hours this hurt my grade significantly as he does not clearly outline the expectations on the papers during class time had i gone to hours i likely have had this issue
1.0,M,he is a horrible professor his website is as awful as he is design patterns are such stuff as dreams are made on is his catch phrase on his website that even grammatically make sense never mind the fact i have no idea what it means i know how he can criticize anyone website he is avoid
1.0,M,he continuously asks you to redo projects and then drops your grade for handing them in late he spent most of the classes trying to figure out his own code rather then teaching us how to code things
2.0,W,she is very rude if she feels comfortable with you she has no problem calling you out in front of the entire class making you look stupid unless you are one of her favorites she could care less about you or how she makes you feel you do get a good work out but not worth the humiliation or the frustration
1.5,W,do not take she is the worst professor ever had at ric western lit is a required gen ed course and she gears it towards english majors very rude and does not care about the students at all requires you to buy about novels and you go through about one every week grading is based on her opinion of you awful
4.0,W,very outgoing and makes her classes fun and interesting wants all her students to do well
1.5,W,would not recommend her she takes way to long to respond to questions online course and takes even longer to grade assignments i learned nothing from her she is a course administrator not a teacher also not flexible with anything i would keep looking if you want a teacher
5.0,M,dennis is by far the best teacher ever had hilarious and brilliant he is also an incredible person and anyone who gets to know him is very lucky his classes are incredible--take one
3.0,M,i think he might have retired by now but i had him for my spring eng class he made us buy this expensive book we used only for a while during the semester he made us write only three stories and a final paper and there it was we all got an a for his class not the best but not the worst either
3.5,M,ok i thought he was lazy had us write a bunch of papers not give back but if you do the work and attend class be ok as i am sure i am getting my a i think he is retiring after this spring semester
2.0,M,cool teacher easy class and hardly any work i had him once a week for a night class we never stayed the hours usually held us for hrs went through the readings with us in class so we knew what the material was only knock on him is hes a tough grader midterm final paper
5.0,M,amazing i love this professor he is so much fun helpful and easy you really gonna learn hebrew with him in the fun way
2.0,M,boring there is little structure to the class and he always stick to the syllabus the midterm is relatively easy there are a couple of debates and papers but i get much out of the class you pretty much teach yourself with the information from the book hard to understand the points he wants to make
2.5,M,boring class never knew what he was talking about most of the time the book is not a must he is good at teaching he would be better if he gave some sort of outline for what he was teaching
5.0,M,the material is challenging but delameter knows his stuff never had any problems asking him questions he gets a bad rap i suspect because most people around here want to put in the effort be screwed at other schools attend class study ask questions the class was interesting and he was super cool
1.0,M,he makes the class harder than it actual should be just a midterm and a are both so hard he allow any eating in his class and if he sees you eating get ready to walk out the room throw it out or put it away if you ask a question and he feels it is stupid oh man he will make sure to tell you that
4.0,M,this is a very hard class but if you do not follow than you are in learning theory is no joke and dr delamater knows his stuff if you go to his office hours he well help you out if you want a challange take his not always about
5.0,M,he has a sweet personality loves teaching statistics the course is very hard but he teaches everything with clarity the quizzes and help boost the grade totally recommended
1.5,M,prof hirschl is awful dsoc is awful if you do the work you will get a good grade but the amount of work is obscene for such a stupid class hirschl tests you on his own material and his own views i didnt know what sociology was until i looked it up three weeks into class he makes you buy books for two chapters avoid if you enjoy sanit y
3.5,M,if you try get a good grade hirschl hates economics and spends most of the time explaining his own views and supporting himself with questionable evidence whenever he uses scientific evidence as support he looks foolish to the science majors all correct answers on exams are variations of whites men are oppressing blacks women
4.5,M,ryan is the best professor had so far his class is very intellectually stimulating and very very fun we write essays with a focus on technique and style not content he made all of us better and more engaging writers i wish i could take this class again
5.0,M,if you have to take english take ryan he is hilarious and the class discussions are so good and any activity you do in class is creative and fun he teaches you to be a good non-textbooky type of writer best english teacher i have ever had i was a better writer for sure once i left his class
4.5,M,ryan stark may possibly be my favorite teacher of all time he encourages you to actually think for yourself and explore your writing he lets you do rewrites but only to benefit your writing favorite class in college so far i loved him
3.0,M,remember to bring your laptop you will watch over half the class surf facebook during his lecture this class is very important but its so boring a lot of people say nice but how he is to everybody until you cross him smile at you and tell you to read the book a students will get bs good luck staying awake
5.0,M,his zeal and compassion to better not only his students but anyone around him is unmatched it more than an honor to have him as a professor coach and approachable subject matter expert hence i am without a doubt fully confident to recommend him as a genuine mentor and leader in mis business intelligence and database
4.0,M,dr shirani is a great professor he is very supportive of students you need the textbook and you need a clear understanding of the concepts his questions go beyond understanding of terms if lazy do everyone a favor and drop the course really rude to play games on your laptop during lecture this is college
3.5,M,boring teacher he reads off of power point slides monotonously for the lectures of your grade is based on two tests which you will have no shot on if you study like never studied before i liked the content of the class and you will gain valuable skills that will look great on your resume oracle mostly
4.5,M,negative ratings for prof shirani are unjustified he is extremely nice he even have a huge curves on midterm final lectures can be boring but if you pay attention the concept is crystal clear no project few hw assignment and it no quizzes mis major you have alternative choice just show up and decide for yourself
1.0,M,a nice person but is a horrible professor super boring not clear ppl in class were so bored most of them were online chatting u basically teach urself the material since his poor teaching skills lead to poor grades he gives huge curves which still only lead to mostly after the curve i feel sorry for u if u take this with him
4.5,M,prof shirani is by far the best professor had at sjsu this is the first time i bother commenting on a professor because i feel that most of the comments here for prof shirani justifiable he is always willing to help his students those that do not pass his class with a good grade probably bother to try the exams are significa
4.0,W,im continuing my review from the one below the other comments seem ridiculous her looks matter about how she can help you if you are not afraid to ask for help take her she push you away she does have a little tardy issue but that just means you can be a little late yourself i wish she was teaching this semester
2.0,W,her tests are impossible very boring powerpoints are pointless they help you at all take her if you can help it run awayy
5.0,W,enjoyed class and learne so much you get out of it what you put in to it you will not fail her course if you read and study i struggled through her course and earned a a and no it was not easy but it was well worthy it i feel ready for grad school if you are looking for and easy a cake walk class this is not the professor for you
1.5,W,she is a very nice lady and that is the only nice thing i could find to say her lectures are not have nothing to do what is on her test do not depend on your notes or her notes they help you you must read the book a least times the test come directly from the book do not depend on a review she give one take her
3.0,W,she never responds to emails its incredibly annoying and frustrating especially when she is grading your papers and is taking her merry time doing it
5.0,W,when the semester started i was really put off by dr condit but my opinion changed yes very liberal and yes she can be too vocal about that however she has excellent insight into general concepts of politics and the discussions are valuable also probably the only professor had at vcu who really cares about her students
3.5,W,ok teacher read labs before class and try to do assignments or they will take up the whole lab adds stuff to test that she talks about that found in the book or on the lab so take notes seems very knowledgeable on subject matter as well as enthusiastic about teaching failed to stop disruptive talking during her lecture
5.0,M,this guy knows how to teach so busy as chair of the department but make time for you and amazing one on one if you like paper tests let you do an oral test and he really works with your needs fantastic please take a class with him a genius
5.0,W,took anth with her last term and definitely one of the best profs had she is so passionate about the subject it makes us all excited about it too she covers the textbook very well and is still able to pull in other interesting facts and stories without getting sidetracked lectures were long but i never once looked at the time
4.5,W,the best prof ever had never seen anyone being so passionate about the subject she is very very helpful and really cares about her students the course involves a lot of readings but her lectures are incredible and really interesting which helps a lot
4.5,W,really awesome prof really fun and really engages the entire class with the course material she makes more of a discussion-type environment than a classroom and is more of a friendly classmate as opposed to a professor the class was really interesting but a lot of reading she is really clear on what she wants you to do take her classes
4.0,W,the class was interested i have to some new things and the professor is very passionate and energetic i normally would not complain about the amount of reading in upper year courses but she assignmed pages per week and almost never discussed them in class also the poster i felt like i was in grade again
5.0,W,amazing prof her course was informative and fun she is very clear with the requirements of the course and what is expected she incorporates videos discussions visuals in her lecture class just flew by just do your work attend class and do great she is also very helpful with the final essay ask her for help and there
5.0,W,an amazing professor very energetic and obviously passionate about the course lectures are nearly always very interesting she knows how to interact well with students and seems very approachable gives very clear guidelines for quizzes a lot of reading though and lectures always touch on them much museum assignment is interesting
3.5,M,his class really that hard we did speeches all test were open book the final is very easy he always opens the very first class with a magic trick he is a very monotone person you can get away with missing a few classes but if you dont wanna read the book then dont miss class he says to read but i never did i still passed
2.5,M,mr wilkerson is an experienced and almost overqualified teacher be cautious when you take him his class is hard with a heavy schedule a vulture about texting and he know how to respond to public criticism this class is his life and he expects it to be yours so be prepared
2.0,M,for a speech teacher the class is extremely boring and monotone after all main point of public speaking is keeping your audiences attention if you can not do this how does he think he can teach you to do it
4.5,W,the lectures are enjoyable the projects and papers are easy and the exams are reasonable honestly the only bad thing i can think of saying is that she made us buy an expensive book that barely used she seems to really care about her classes
5.0,W,i like classes at small campuses where they cram like students into a lecture hall however for managing such a big class asplin really cares about her students and that they do well not always in her office during hours but more than willing to meet with you do the reading write the papers come to class pass
4.0,W,liberal feminist teaching in one of the most conservative places in the country she is interesting and if you open your mind you will leave enlightened and changed unapologetic and sometimes frightening she is serious but has a good sense of humor class consists of powerpoints lecture and note taking easy class if you pay attention
5.0,W,such an amazing professor she really knows who is going to make it and who in the real world also gives great advise on how to showcase your portfolio i would recommend her to anyone
4.5,W,she brought the to what design is rather than coming off as a typical cut it in the real-world type of stigma a professor can get in this industry
4.5,M,tarkow is the best professor had at mizzou really funny and is very open to different ideas and interpretations he is a relatively harsh grader but if you do the work and pay attention in class you should be fine
4.0,M,taking greek classics in translation with him super fun teacher mostly lectures with some discussion interesting fair grader
3.5,M,daniel was a very good teacher he could have taught more about sculpture but instead gave us materials and sent us on our way i would have liked more interaction and instruction in this class but daniel was very constructive with his criticism and was genuinely interested in helping his students do well pretty good for a foundation class
4.5,M,if you do what he ask of you you should be fine i really enjoyed the class and the people who took the class with me were amazing just follow every instruction that he gives and you should be fine i really enjoyed singing in front of the class
5.0,M,i took his sosc class online and it was great it was very straightforward everything came from the textbook it was an easy a for me and he was always helpful and emailed back right away
3.5,W,she is a very nice teacher most classmates likes her she give the people good mark
2.0,W,she is a nice teacher
3.0,W,she is nice teacher i like her treat people very equal
1.5,M,taught that class like you already knew what he was talking about and i was silly enough to think that i take classes to learn the material in them tried several times to go to his office hours but he was never there sent him multiple emails but he never responded would strongly recommend never taking this professor
4.5,M,to counter the prior comment then i think if one shows up at lectures reads the book and actually takes time to understand the material then one can do well i ended up with a good grade prof englander is very knowledgeable and i recommend his course if you actually want to learn things but for a free ride then this course is not the one
5.0,M,fantastic professor had him for several classes if there were more profs like jon have a phd
5.0,W,dr sinning rocks my world she has the patience of a nun this woman is a saint a total blessing to wmu students are lucky to have her teaching god bless this woman the best professor i have ever had my only gripe is that she give enough room on the exams to work out problems you have to write really small oh well dr sinning rocks
5.0,W,best teacher you do not need the book if there even is one she gives you handouts does great examples study all of your notes and you will do find tests are short she def knows her stuff even if you failed her class you would want to take her again she is great
4.0,W,dr waterhouse is a really nice lady who is willing to help you if you need it every english class can be sloe but she tries her best to keep your interest she is not too hard of a grader and i would definitely recommend her for an english class
4.5,W,very nice teacher she grades the papers fairly easily and she is pretty helpful as well only complaint is that sometimes class just seems to drag on very boring sometimes but overall i would recommend
5.0,W,good prof explains very well and uses examples from the real world tests are very fair and i did learn alot from the class very good course to take in also she provides bonus marks and it is a good courswe to take to learn some finanacial stuff and for easy good grade
1.0,W,basically this teacher is useless her included things we never learned and she makes the questions as confusing as possible when i try to get ask questions she can never explain it clearly the class average was so believe what was written below avoid from a high gpa student
5.0,W,she is a great woman with lots of experience in this field you can know so much new and important stuff in her class just by listening a lot and keeping your mind open the class is not difficult but very interesting i do recommend to take this class and i do recommend margaret she is very knowledgeable and nice
3.0,W,absolutely the worst professor i have ever had the class was boring to begin with and all based on attendance i aced the entire thing but then when i turned in the paper somehow she gave me a zero because of some big mistake that she made i tried to contact her about my grade and it took her a month to get back with me
2.0,W,did not like her one of the worst teachers ever had very boring class and waste your money buying the book because never use it
2.0,W,the class is easy you just have to show up i was very dissappointed because i love psyc classes and she was an aweful teacher buy the book a waste of money the only thing she will teach you all semester is attachment theory overall a bad teacher
4.5,M,i would recommend this class his test is super easy because he gives you most of the questions in the study guide but the essay part is really hard its pretty easy to get a b he takes attendance but is pretty lenient i would recommend going to every class however i liked him
5.0,W,extremely helpful and will go out of her way to help you understand the concepts offered extra credit opportunities with the first tests and replaced lowest test grade with the final if final is higher as long as you put forth effort you should do great in her class
5.0,W,she is the sweetest professor and most helpful math teacher i have ever had trust me take her ive always been horrible at math intill this will work any problem you need anytime gives easy ec and test are just like study guide easy and nice
5.0,W,love this teacher great she explains everything clearly and works with you if you have any questions she gives out extra credit for all the tests and the tests themselves are exactly what she goes over there are no surprises taken her twice now and been amazing both times definitely take her you be disappointed
5.0,M,took web class great teacher and awesome class hws super easy straight from book and a few journals and dbs no deadlines for hws very self-paced very responsive if you need help only test is final multiple choice at home can tell he really enjoys what he teaches take this class
5.0,M,took web class great teacher and awesome class hws super easy straight from book and a few journals and dbs no deadlines for hws very self-paced very responsive if you need help only test is final multiple choice at home can tell he really enjoys what he teaches take this class
5.0,M,is a really good teacher and his online class was great i would recommend him to anyone his online class was very easy and self paced journals kind of difficult but not really other than that great teacher and he also explains to you why he gave the grade he did really good take his class
4.5,M,i took his hum and his class is hard to fail all you have to do is complete the assignments which for the most part are open book quiezzes and they are not timed so take him
3.0,M,decent class make sure you print out all the notes and write in the margins to study there are tests and he drops the lowest grade if you take all kinda funny sometimes gives some extra credit
4.0,M,he is a nice guy offers extra credit and is willing to help however he that clear when he speaks because he talks fast and confuses himself at times for the tests he simply says read the chapters look at the outline look at the tables do the learning outcomes and the chapter very helpful and its a lot to study
5.0,M,he is such a great teacher and loves what he does simply print out the guidelines and write simple notes in the margin and study it you have at least a b in the class he is such a nice guy and makes a lot of jokes i would recommend him to anyone oh and he drops one test grade if you take all
3.5,M,you really need to go to class everyday whoever says that he is a bad teacher is probably one of those slackers that never come to class if you come to class take notes and ask questions when you have them do fine i hate biology and i got a b seriously i would definitely recommend taking him if your a hard worker
2.0,W,a very nice person quite old but seems to have a good head on her shoulders teacher wise not very good she never explains thorougly and never answers questions she gets easily disappointed in your work because not what she wants highly unrecommended
2.0,M,this guy not even sure where to start smart and sometimes funny but is unclear and gives difficult assignments clarify what he wants would rather you figure it out for yourself grills students i took him as a freshmen first semester and regret it unless you enjoy a challenge choose a different teacher
4.0,M,favorite professor ever took his class for ge and it blew my mind those who do not like hard work should stay away there are plenty of classes you can take and sleep through if all my classes had been as challenging and thought provoking as the one class i took with coleman my college years would have been amazing bravo
2.0,M,he is not clear at all he asks for your questions but does not respond well to them he goes off on tangents that do not seem to relate to the point and some how you are supposed to make a connection it is time for him to retire
2.0,M,an amazing prof who has heard and seen it all and will let you have it if he suspects you of bsing or laziness those who accuse him of being mean missed his point completely his relentless prodding is the effort of a man who genuinely cares about his students listen to the bitter students who take the heat the best at ssu
3.0,M,i had this teacher in and he was an awesome teacher scary but in the end he made me think about what reading like i never have before and that is what got me through college he is a real teacher that expects you to learn
3.5,M,by far the best teacher i have ever had without a doubt he has taught me more in courses than the rest of my college experience combined the people who give him a bad rap never invested enough in their learning to understand him in the first place the only teacher who waste your time but he expects that you want to learn
1.5,M,very difficult class robert coleman enjoys putting students on the spotlight and will keep pressuring you to speak even when you have no idea what to say try to speak as little as possible in the class do not raise your hand you have to read about pages of online or textbook material for each class or else he will put you on the spot
5.0,M,best professor ever genuinely a nice guy who just wants everyone to do well tests are nearly identical to the review problems he assigns always willing to clarify concepts in lecture and holds plenty of office hours
5.0,M,one of the best math professors someone could hope for i had him for bus calc and he was wonderful he was always available to help even outside of his official office hours he really appreciates if you show that trying some of his test questions straight from the review and homework so as long as you understand those be fine
5.0,M,i had him for business calc and he made everything easy to understand if you go to class and pay attention there is no way you can fail he is very nice cares about his students and approachable
5.0,W,speech is a very scary course for many people i did very well in this class with her support she is witty and helpful i especially appreciated how she helped students with fear who were shy or english language learners build their confidence i wish she taught more classes
5.0,W,one of the best teachers at ncc professor solon is one of those teachers who touches your life i learned so much in this class it also gave me the courage to take more art classes even though i am not an art student she difficult as long as you show your trying in the class she always offers help to her students
4.0,M,awesome teacher if you want a class that is going to push you to be a better writer take tim one of the most friendliest down to earth teachers ever had big on questioning things civil disobedience and service learning never be afraid of him he will give you all the time you need if you come to him during his freetime
5.0,M,he is the best
4.5,M,he can come off a bit arrogant but he is always willing to go the extra mile and help you as long as respectful work with you
1.0,M,the worst professor ever went into his class expecting a lot because other students raved about him what a arrogant and napoleanic
3.0,M,tests are pretty easy but he can be stingy with points he so boring though
5.0,W,this teacher rocks i had zero interest in going to this class but i learned much with her stage material outlines she is very supportive of everyone and tries to get you to be a good speaker one of the best teachers i have had and i would take this class again in a second i have used her outlines for other classes for presentations
1.5,M,i found myself more worried about following his way then actually learning the material the problems that he works out on the board would be counted wrong in his exams he avoids doing problems his way because its a waste of time but yet still expects you to do it his way the class is fine just chose a different instructor
1.0,M,so many problems know how to teach cant hear the student asking questions takes whole class to do problem forces us to solve the long and hard way if not done like how he done it minus i took phys soph high school and i have gpa so no im not stupid his class is just horrible acc needs to fire him immediately
1.0,M,prepare to do a lot of outside study to learn anything in this class all lectures are just powerpoint slides and frequently have mistakes in them he takes off points on hw tests for things like not showing work on basic math and not using the exact format he uses on formulas he also has a hard time understanding any questions people ask
1.0,W,had to take almost all of her classes for my major she is the worst she is late for almost every class unorganized and rude her classes are boring and she knows about what she teaches from books no personal exp she is also a bad advisor
1.5,W,in order to be successful you have to be able to do the work on your own her test material come from all over the place and are unpredictable her study guides are useless because she do not test what is on them she is hard to get a hold of and never returns calls or emails hybrid course tests are in testing center outside of classtime
5.0,W,such a great class her class lectures totally blew my mind and i learned tons of useful analytical techniques that i applied to other classes i especially appreciated the time professor siegfried took to conference with every student in regards to how to improve their writing highly recommend
2.5,M,i agree with the other comment that he for the faint of heart i was ready to drop the day but i found him to be fair have a sense of humor give many opportunities to improve your grade need support from the lab since very short on explanations but in the end i enjoyed being in his class passed the compass made an a
1.0,M,dr hardy is the worst teacher i have ever had my entire life i recommend him to my enemy i went to his office to ask him for help and he laughed in my faced i had a math class in years and he was not willing to help the slightest bit i withdrew so i fail
1.0,M,is the most incompetent teacher i have ever had the displeasure of knowing had i not known math before i started his class i would be failing he is very rude and is completely disinterested in his students if you black he doesnt care about you so if you are going to take his class white people you better get a tan
2.0,M,he is the worst teacher possible no matter what you do you can please him he will not help and if you ask questions he talks to you like your dumb when he grades he does not make sense and when he teaches its like reading off a teleprompter i have never seen him be nice or fai
4.0,M,is a very fair teacher you must do your never know when it might count as your test math was never easy for me but i made an a in his class you will need to go to the study lab but it pays off
3.5,M,dr hardy is not for the faint-at-heart immature or lazy he expects you to catch on quickly and is not going to baby anyone if you do the work you should pass also not very helpful so be ready to spend time in the tutoring lab
1.5,M,most days he is minutes late to class then he sits down and reads off a powerpoint pay attention and take notes because this is a class where you do have to teach yourself most of it it uncommon for him to laugh at your questions and simply tell you easy and he already showed how even so class is passable with effort
2.0,M,hes a great teacher he gives alot of information just pass his tests and quizes and do great in his class you dont need to buy the txt book
4.5,M,tu is lucky to have him as a prof one of the best teachers that ever had very entertaining and straight forward gives great examples about what he is lecturing on take good notes review them before the exams no text needed wait to take him again
1.5,M,such a good professor his tests are straight from the notes and he pretty much tells you whats going to be on them makes class very interesting because he talks about his experiences as opposed to lecturing from notes highly recommend and buy the book
5.0,M,really enjoyed this class do not buy text all info provided in notes and exams are from his notes he has very interesting examples from his experience pay ateention study notes you will do well i looked forward to this class and am taking a class with him next semester because of this sometimes he comes off a little sharp but he is nice
4.5,M,very nice guy laid back and makes class interesting he knows what hes talking about and very knowledgeable doesnt require the use of a textbook tests are straightforward page paper on a disability you take on for a day would definately recommend to others
4.5,M,very nice guy laid back and makes class interesting he knows what hes talking about and very knowledgeable doesnt require the use of a textbook tests are straightforward page paper on a disability you take on for a day would definately recommend to others
5.0,M,amazing teacher knows his material very entertaining makes going to class fun would take him a million times more no textbook and is very straight forward about the exams
2.0,W,easiest class taken but also the biggest waste of time learn anything we met most days and just watched her search on google she was not prepared she has an open door policy so she will always help you good at giving advice but bad teacher
2.0,W,easy class but she gets off subject bad she spends most of the time taking about what to do if your going to be a teacher which has nothing to do with the class all the test are online but you have to look up every question because she goes over none of it in class
4.5,M,he expects a lot from his student you will need to work however he will help you if needed he usually grades on a curve and a very kind one at that friendly and will gladly have a chat about physics and how it works especially if it helps your understanding in the class
3.5,M,i took the shakespeare uw with this prof and a little harsh he teaches you what you need to know and i loved watching the movies he grades really strictly make sure you develop all arguments participate in class
1.0,W,worst professor ever had refused to read my paper or answer my questions when i went to office hours and instead sent me to her ta absolutely thinks god and takes herself way too seriously cold hearted and only cares about herself i think she got pissed no one came to her lectures and failed everyone for the final out of spite
1.0,W,awful teacher incredibly boring would teach lectures and no one would show up she would make sassy comments at people who did come very hard grader not a lot learned you can take a lot better classes than this at nyu do not do it
2.0,M,though a highly intelligent man with a kind heart darren is far from a great teacher his lectures are unengaging and often straight from the textbook and he gives poor guidance on assignments he does leave excellent feedback on papers but the fact remains that he simply cannot communicate the material meant to be teaching
2.5,M,i was a tad bit disappointed in this course he is all over the place with his work which gets a bit tedious though he is a nice guy and an easy marker i help but think that it is not his class to teach
3.5,M,i found darren hynes to be very approachable knowledgeable and efficient overall i will admit that i was bored in his lectures and found that he did little to make the course interesting but he marked students fairly and simply took all of the material straight from the book he my favourite but his course was relatively romper
3.0,M,although very unclear a great prof his lectures go all over the place but he relies on the texts so if you bring those to class understand his lectures willing to help and wants people to do well in his class he has a great knowledge of the subject matter but can be a little vague about what he wants in assignments
3.5,M,dr hynes is approachable and is extremely knowledgeable in his field his lectures can be funny but are usually dry however i found him to be a little too laid back and even vague at times i found his course to be neither good nor bad mediocre
4.5,W,dr chen is great she really tries to help you understand this material also available outside of class for extra help her tests can be complicated but if you study be fine a great prof and looking forward to future classes with her
3.5,M,im a little sad to see so few reviews for sparks he is great alot of people hate him with good reason hes an antagonizer he has no idea how to do anything other than make you feel something hes not a a old man sharing all that he knows and it may or not be alot but he gets under skin better than a sliver he does name drop he d
2.0,M,if you have to take this class please do not take it with this teacher because he is extremely hard i took him for basic bio and currently taken his anatomy class on line and man does he make the questions hard to find i passed his bio class with an and now trying to pass his anatomy class on line with at least an take him
3.5,W,unfortunately she is just not qualified to teach about the middle east rather than providing students with knowledge they need to engage and combat the paradigms in question she attempts to train them as activists perhaps this is because her knowledge base is in english literature and is seriously lacking in history and politics of the region
4.5,W,therese deals in the study of marginalized voices--the views and experiences not heard in popular education i think she is amazing and one of the best professors ever had she was always encouraging never dominated in seminar and has vast knowledge of feminist studies and the middle east she is awesome
4.5,M,is really passionate about his job for an english class it was a piece of cake i would recommend it to anyone he is very easy going and cares i felt bad not going to his classes he assign much but when he does make sure to do the work he expects that and will call you out great class
5.0,W,great professor everyone who does well in her class loves her if you understand her style of teaching you should do well if you are a bad notetaker you will not do well she is excellent and i have taken classes now with her and a lab each better than the first
4.5,M,i thought he was a very helpful teacher actually teaches and writes notes in class unlike westmoreland who expects you to learn it all on your own helpful and nice if you go in for extra help if you do the homework and keep up with the work you will do well
4.5,M,really fun to have a class with but the homework in proof techniques is extremely difficult it balances out in the end if you enjoy a challenge and you already have a firm grasp on calculus take his classes
4.5,M,dr neal reminds me why i love math he makes sure you truly understand the material he has the best nerdy jokes too
3.0,M,not a fan the free-willed nature of the professor is liberating and for that i commend however that strength is the seed of his destruction he offers hardly any challenge for the course and is evident he taking it seriously better off with other professors
5.0,M,this class african american lit was my favorite class of my university career he challenged us to think about racially heavy topics this is a very good thing for people to do we ignore race far too often the sentiment usually goes we all know racism is bad so what else do we need to talk about he also chose wonderful texts
3.5,M,the readings were really interesting and obviously a very smart guy intimidating at times and after taking numerous english classes he is most definately the hardest marker that encountered
4.0,M,i found this class challenging and enlightening is an animated lecturer who is passionate about his work i found him a little intimidating but he was always helpful when i went to see him i loved the readings highly recommended
2.0,M,he talks about such sometimes and things that relevent to the class his tests are aweful just make sure you read the textbook
4.5,W,i had her for african history which was good but if you can get her for a smaller seminar she is fantastic laid back extremely intelligent and very responsive and really tries to help if you have questions not always easy but fair great prof
5.0,W,she teases but only teasing and she does it to everyone and she really knows piano backwards and forwards and will help you out in a minute her grading is also very fair just practice be okay

1.5,M,what a mess i was injured while i was taking the class where i sit and asked for an exam deferal he told me to stand and write the exam rude avoid this guy
5.0,W,dr class is not easy because the subject music theory is not easy she is brilliant and an excellent teacher she takes time with students who understand most at wu sadly and holds lots of extra office hours i could not have made it through theory without dr deguchi
3.0,W,she is a very cheerful lady and extremely excited about what she does loves to hear herself talk and the class is more boring than peeling a potato plus she gives a ton of assignments good luck
4.5,W,so easy and fun she loves what doing its a class on how to use a computer and different things on the web on class was spent discussing whether to buy a pc or a mac that was also one of our assignments so easy and helpful just do all your homework and get an a do whatever she can to help you awesome
4.5,W,dr hosseini is one of the cutest instructors at she gives the students a stack of notes on one of the first days of class and reads it word for word throughout the semester the class is actually interesting the exams are fairly easy if you pay attention in class and she curves like there is no tomorrow highly recommended
3.5,W,loved her she is the best if you like boring but super easy classes take her and for islamic cultures she is really funny the tests are nothing but super easy
4.5,W,i took contemporary chinese fiction class with her and really liked it the class was a good balance of lecture and discussion there was a lot of reading that was necessary to do and there were papers and and a min presentation
3.0,M,dr bell can come off as a difficult professor however if you express interest in the class and attempt to participate in group discussions you should be fine def go talk to him in his office and be afraid to ask for help he also gives you extra-credit and rewrites on big papers which is fair compensation for the demanding work
1.5,M,we had an office meeting to go over my essay and he told me to my face that i make umbc look like a joke because i should not have gotten this should change have a gift for speak english and german fluently though not helpful at mostly until to pick favorites and not so luckies
1.5,M,i took this professor for a summer spanish class my experience was terrible he tries to weed out the students that already know spanish if you get a question wrong he will insult you if you ask a question he will insult you if you forget an accent mark the whole question is wrong
1.5,M,prof bell is unclear with directions and is very rude the class is supposed to focus on culture in film however he only focused on cinematic technique after looking at his comments on papers it is clear he only skimmed the paper before commenting his suggestions on sentence structure made it grammatically incorrect and took away the meaning
3.5,M,very straightfoward with material you know exactly what will be on an exam knows a lot about spain from experience a bit full of himself in terms of knowing interrupts students speaking a lot and brags about his daughter a lot but he gets his points across study guides exactly what will be on exams just pay attention
1.0,M,very rude answer any questions and is quick to assume the worst in his students after this class never take a class with him again
1.0,M,i am so glad i dont have to take him again
5.0,M,this professor is great and gives a lot of real knowledge to the students but he does give a lot of work thats the reason why students are giving him these horrible ratings because they do not like to the work he has a lot of knowledge of the federal great
1.0,M,i must say he has been one of hardest educators ever experienced the textbook he co-wrote is like reading another language and never learning that new language he will definitely ruin your gpa he is of no help and cares less if you learn or not students are unable to do well on the discussion boards on quizzes even worst never take him
2.5,M,i know where this guy thinks he is teaching an online class and is insane do not take him this is not graduate school but is taught like it is a level course like he hates student and gets them by assigning ridiculous work

2.5,W,she frequently calls on you out of nowhere and often makes you feel stupid when you know the answer
4.0,W,tons of quizzes and homework every class a class where you definitely have to stay on top of things or youll get behind quickly she is really nice but sometimes not very clear she tries to make class fun by doing activities but most of the time not
3.0,W,she really likes when you participate in class make sure you are prepared for class because it allows more opportunities to participate
1.5,M,nice guy terrible at teaching does not teach does not offer help explains things incorrectly if i taken ap chem in high school i would have failed he definitely picks favorites and pretty sure that he hates women
1.0,M,terrible teacher he just drones on and on and talks about everything but chemistry an analytical chemist so a very picky grader he gave me a on the first lab i switched into and now i have an a get out of while you can
3.0,M,i skipped almost every friday and still made an a in his class not the best teacher but if you decide to put in the work its an easy class all you need to do is go over his powerpoints and do the suggested problems
1.5,M,awful professor extremely boring and way too difficult i really say learned that much from him never put so much effort into a class and gotten nothing out of it grade-wise or knowledge-wise
1.5,M,worst prof ever i basically taught myself everything in that course horrible explanations when i went in for help he seemed like he had no interest in helping me i will never ever take a class from him again
3.5,W,she is a great teacher have to do the work in order to maintain a c or higher the test are not that difficult because you can use a cheat sheet make sure you keep all your notes and papers she hands back because she does a binder check that is worth points which can help your grade a lot
2.0,M,milner is a great teacher and knows his stuff but he is the most disorganized person ever never responds to emails will admit he read them but doesnt respond he changes dates around forgets what he assigned and when things are due easy class but i never knew what was going on
1.0,M,do not take meshaw he does not teach anything and he mumbles so badly you cannot understand anything he says he simply uses class time to go over the cases in each chapter and the homework his tests are very very difficult instead take this class online at fscj
1.5,M,tests were pretty tough all he does in class is go over homework teach anything homework has nothing to do with the tests the class average was so low he let us take the third test home and still most people thought it was too difficult
3.0,M,okay so most people take this just for the credits and thats all he goes too hard
2.0,W,even though i got an a in this class it was a torture to go to every single class she was so unprepared and unorganized she was confusing and went on and on about one slide forever she was hard to understand and so boring nice lady but if i had known i would have taken the class with someone else i learned nothing terrible professor
4.0,W,ellie is a wonderful woman that cares about her students learning if you ask her questions do her best to help she tells a lot of stories about her feminist days and about her family expect an a if you never participate in class or take notes the material is difficult but becomes clearer and easier as the class goes on
5.0,W,i took gender and social change with dr downer it was an online class she expects a lot but it is great the readings she selects are eye opening i really enjoyed the class a lot and recommend you take her if you have the opportunity
5.0,W,great class enthusiastic professor she made learning fun and i have a great transfer portfolio she helped me get into my transfer school too thank you
2.5,W,prof scott is supposedly one of the most qualified accounting professors however her ability to explain things such as pension plans is limited and her slides are not very clear and useful for exam review be sure to master fundamental accounting materials before taking her class
4.5,W,professor scott really knows her stuff her exams and assignments are challenging but fair one of the better accounting profs a class quiz two case studies midterm and final make sure you know how to write a proper case as it makes up for half of your mark on the exams recommend her but have to do work to keep up
2.5,M,as a professor although he was really out there i appreciatd jim for opening my eyes to a different style of theatre however as a graduate advisor he has failed us miserably he respond to emails or look over drfts simply complaining too busy
1.0,W,wow she is the most unclear professor ever had she expects everyone to grow up and be a professional journalist for the new york times she grades very hard and unfair never expect a on homework bother asking for her help she give it to you she is overall insane and should not be teaching dont take a class with her
3.0,W,overall she is a decent teacher but there are some problems she is unclear about what she expects from assignments her grading system is harsh as she grades people as though they are professionals also she tends to babble quite a bit and talks endlessly however she is very nice and approachable and is willing to help when needed
5.0,W,she is one of my favorite professors ever hilarious honest fun and intelligent she loves to teach and wants her students to succeed if you do the reading and answer the exam questions beforehand do great i highly recommend taking her before you graduate from ou oh and her class gets easier as the semester progresses awesome
1.0,W,dr bishop personifies the failings of the ub program she does not teach instead relies on rudimentary handouts with questionable value her grade scale defies explanation
5.0,M,i took psych with joe in as an elective it totally changed my direction in life i became a therapist i took three more classes with him before graduation and he was by far the most interesting an informative teacher in the department
5.0,M,very easy long as you do your work go to the class you will do fine on the test he gives you answer before the he also give take-home quiz very chill and experienced
4.0,W,shes a good teacher she knows her stuff isnt easy if in the class to learn be ok if there because you have to be have some gives a lot of assignments she really does care about the culinary students she can be in a rush w everything she has to do at the school your not just another student w her

5.0,M,bill is easily one of my favorite teachers he makes the class fun and his teaching methods work great i would definitely recommend taking his class
3.0,M,i know why getting such a bad rap sure not the best teacher around but a nice guy and will amaze you with his sports knowledge just do all the readings which are mostly interesting and write everything you know on the essay tests and be fine the baseball salary arbitration paper is really fun not a hard class
3.5,M,one thing about mr pouncy he talks about his gun alot he has alot of stories but generally not a bad teacher even though it was back in fall it bad
2.0,M,if you take this teacher online he is useless know how to work ecampus will receive incorrect grades and when you email him about it good luck getting a response
1.5,M,jerry jones is a useless teacher his students have no idea what they are missing as far as higher music theory education goes i feel sorry for students who take their first two years of college theory from him because they are going to be in for a rough ride when they transfer mr j is nice but definitely not suited to teach college
5.0,M,he is extremely helpful he was more than willing to do all he could to ensure that i understood the content professor jones is a wonderful teacher
5.0,M,i had john corvino for contemporary moral issues and it was by far my favorite class taken at wayne he is hilarious and makes discussions fun he is open to opinion and does not force his on you overall an excellent professor strongly recommended
5.0,M,there is no excuses for not doing well his tests were straight off the notes and their wasnt even that many notes to learn in the first place anyone who said it was hard or that he was bad simply did not try
5.0,M,the kind of professor every college student should experience at least once in their academic life entertaining so the class never gets boring and if you have a problem and talk to him very understanding just make sure to keep up with the reading and try to say at least one thing in class he likes class participation
5.0,M,prof corvino is awesome make sure you come to class and read the material and you will do just fine his were awesome too very helpful and clear
4.5,M,amazing professor smart as well as will be glued to your seat during his go to office will help you out i lovv him you have to study your material and show him you know is noy impossible as long as u know your stuff
5.0,M,he is a awesome teacher im taking more philosophy classes just because of his teaching and because he is so hot
4.5,W,ms laidlaw was an amazing professor very energetic and sarcastic but the class was def worth taking she made the class fun if you dont understand you need to ask for help and she will give you a more in depth answer some of the speehes were a little cheesy but in the long run they help with being able to speak in public
1.0,W,she is very unprofessional and admits that she is biased i have always aced speeches i competed across the state on the speech team in high school and won multiple speech contests and scholarships and got a b in her class you do the math if you have to take her focus more on winning her over than your speeches and do well
3.5,W,an okay teacher like when you disagree with her follow her outline and rules for speechmaking exactly the final speech is really lame interested at all during the class she is super hot though
1.5,M,he is a really great person if you go to his class everyday he will help you more but he is a little old so hard to understand
4.0,M,good teacher helpful if you are here to learn about stats he can help you understand it by simplifying it i get his class and easy to understand though i worry about his health listen to complain about him because they have no interest in math and does not know any bad teacher i would recommend him to my friends
3.5,M,mr tarski is old and hard to understand becuase of his accent but he is really nice he comutes all the way from berkely by bus and is willing to come in on extra days just to help his students the quizes are open book and you are allowed to use hand written notes if you come to class try and ask for help he will definatley give you the letter g
2.5,M,not a math wiz but mr t makes everything quite easy for his students come to class take notes take the quizzes points each then take an almost identical test the next class after a nice review of the quiz notes are allowed for all quizzes although he is sometimes hard to understand the textbook and his teaching method make it easy
1.5,M,this heart is in the right place for sure but unfortunately very difficult to understand he answer questions clearly and talks to the board if you show an interest in his class he will be very lenient with you in terms of grading etc take this class if you are already good at math and you will get an a
4.5,M,he is an amazing teacher there was no group work this semester unlike some of the other comments indicated there were tests all multiple choice and short answer the questions were given to us prior to the tests it made studying for the tests a piece of cake i liked the class he was able to keep a classroom of under control vry well
2.5,M,he tries hard to explain study after study but never quite puts everything into context he is enthusiastic about social psychology on a personal level and that really shines through but he is not a natural born teacher and that hurts his ability to pass on his enthusiasm effectively to the class always available for office hours very nice guy
3.5,M,tersh is very smart very well-read and very enthusiastic about his subjects he just has trouble getting his thoughts out most of his classes are lectured with him pacing head down with his hands clasped funny and sweet but he can be difficult to figure out
3.5,W,she is a very nice easy teacher she will help you and give you time to get projects done however there was no method to her madness as far as how projects were weighted but didnt really natter because as long as you did it fairly well you got an a
5.0,M,great teacher take him if you can goes over homework so you should make a on every assignment exams but they too hard if you study he reviews before every test gives you an opportunity for extra credit by turning in a project early
5.0,M,also took his class a fantastic teacher he makes the class enjoyable goes over the review before every tests and shows you exactly how to do the problems on the test there are tests each is pts multiple choice and pts problems if you listen on review day you should do fine there is a reason his classes always fill up fast
4.0,M,he is a wonderful very fair go the extra mile to help you get to where he knows you need to be in understanding the work i am so glad that i had him and i wish he could have taught acctng ii i recommend him to anyone who has been out of school for awhile or was never required to have acctng in high school thanks again professor
1.0,W,she was hard to understand if you asked a question she wouldnt answer it i almost failed her class because i was so unsure of what to do i learned everything on my own and then in act with hoover i am sure she is a great accountant but not a good teacher at all and not being clear is not teaching at college level its not teaching at all
5.0,W,i enjoyed ms estes she was insightful however if you are immature and want your work hand feed to you then you might not take this class and go back to high school she teaches her class on a college level not high school you act like an adult you are treated like an adult you act like a child you will be treated as a child
4.0,W,she is intelligent and kind however the constant powerpoints of the readings got dull when she rely on them to lecture it was great she will show you a lot of perspectives and the class is overall incredibly interesting
4.5,W,this class was great the readings were interesting she encouraged class discussion she did not seem closed to activism and encouraged people to speak their minds on a variety of issues from many perspectives she is a bit old school but knows a lot and was pretty engaged in the subject material as this is a class she developed
2.5,W,readings were decent but the prof was terrible disdainful of student activism completely closed to student input gets really defensive and unpleasant if you raise critiques especially closed to post-structuralist and deconstructionist approaches she shows upsetting material depicting graphic violence against women in her classes without warni
1.0,M,he is a terrible teacher and if you want to pass do not take him he could care less whether you pass or not he is not doing this job because he enjoys to teach thats for sure do not take him
1.0,M,this guy has no clue what talking about he was out for a week and he came back gave us our test and expected us to know what neither he or the sub went over do no take
5.0,W,take this class her lecture the goods she tells you exactly what to study for and what definitions to know she is also very helpful in explaining the bad there really any just know the words she gives you and you will pass
5.0,W,she was pretty cool and told you exactly what was on the tests you ahve to study non-stop though
5.0,W,if you can memorize at least words a week you will do fine in her class if you good luck in passing
5.0,M,he is great i have him for medical terminology and i absolutely love his class and his ways of grading our tests if i could i would take him again
4.5,W,had her for several classes including online classes goes above and beyond the standards to help and to answer questions always interested in student progress even after graduation knows what she is doing has passion for the subjects she teaches encouraging personality one of the best
3.5,W,art is drawing i learned a lot in this class but not a class you can joke about she is very serious with work because it is a studio class students have to be hardworking and show improvement for her to be happy which is sensible i do recommend her as a drawing teacher
1.5,W,the worst art class i have ever taken and this is harsh since i am an art major and love to write constantly unclear and became frustrated when you understand i asked for extra credit because she wanted to use presentation of mine for future use and she accused me of being manipulative she grades essays hard despite her terrible grammar
2.0,W,very boring she is elderly and soft spoken test are relatively hard however my suggestion is to take her as a hybrid class you only have to meet times and everything else is online also study the slides over and over on every test the time limit is really short
1.0,W,she is way too harsh when grading her essays i never made below a in my english class but i got on my essays in her class she thinks an english teacher apparently i had to dumb down my essays to get an a she did however let me re-write my essay so she heartless
3.5,W,regardless of personality flaws and teaching styles hampton is still a human being she deserves respect and appreciation for what she does and the passion she possesses if you show you are making an effort to learn her material all that matters she expect you to love art but to appreciate it that is key to passing her course
5.0,W,i had to take this class because i get a good act score so i already knew what i was doing she is one of the best math teachers i have ever had she really knows how to break everything down so you can understand although you can not use calculators she makes everything easy enough to be able to do without one
1.5,M,had a b average in there until the final and made a c he is not very clear and will interrupt himself while working out a problem to go on a tangent not recommended
2.5,M,mr conrad was a funny guy but his teaching method is a lot different then what use to if your someone who understands math easy probably enjoy his class otherwise recommend taking another teacher
2.5,W,had a bad experience with this class because she decided at the last minute to make it an online class which i like but when i voiced how i felt about it she was quick to tell me she would not let me fail she even held optional study meetings and was extremely helpful math is not my she helped alot wld take her again
5.0,W,great had her for college algebra online and came out with an a after being absent from math for years she was very helpful to me and i hope i have her again as a prof in the future
5.0,W,dr rita sowell is the best teacher ever had i took calc ii and diff eq from her and absolutely loved is saying a lot about her while she expects you to work hard she does everything in her power to help you and sincerely cares about her students almost sorry for this semester to be over just cause i have her again
5.0,M,great are pg chapter page paper a group project and frequent class if you take into account you have one paper due per week and the rest of the time just very interesting discussion with no tests to cram really learn the information and it will be with you for him
2.5,W,she is a nice lady but sort of hard to understand and really scatterbrained i truly think she wants her students to pass but she exactly easy to understand and her tests are difficult especially since she teaches the new lesson right before the test on the last chapter it makes it confusing
5.0,W,shes super sweet and wants to help but shes a bit scatterbrained did not let me make up a test when i missed for illness so be careful about that and make sure you talk to her when you have to miss
2.5,M,his first time teaching in years lectures were not pertinent much and not updated online until right before final problem sets were managed solely by the tas prelims were fine grade in class is almost solely based on final as stated by email afterwards a decent person but do try to stay away as far as class goes
3.0,M,very good sense of humour teaching methods did not work well for me minimal interaction with students several of my friends did very well though and enjoyed his lectures would prefer a tutorial rather than an extra mins of classtime fair tests but the exam was written by another professor and was not very related to what what we learned
1.5,M,how to describe this prof he is always late for class there is no tutorial because he uses it to teach needs help from student when he makes mistakes tests were rediculously long and the class was never prepared should not be teaching
4.5,M,amazing professor really soft spoken so hard to hear at times but he is extremely knowledgeable and is always willing to help he re sparked an old interest for me
5.0,M,favorite teacher at denison he is so passionate and the class goes by so fast while he expects a lot he makes you want to do well definitely take him if you have the option
1.5,W,a professor who obviously loves her craft but necessarily be teaching it to others
4.5,W,most influential professor teaching research she makes you try in order to pass her class and by doing that you gain so much knowledge definitely take her if you wish to pursue a career dealing with psychological research love her
4.5,W,continued from below but points are given for each day i failed this class with another teacher and ended up with a with dr jackson take her for and so easy and very helpful gives lots of extra credit
4.5,W,dr jacksons class is so simple everything and i mean everything on come straight from lecture notes tests but the first are part online and part essay and the essays she gives you to study before the exams the other exams are part take home and part essay as well and so simple attendance not mandatory but points a
4.5,M,i had pro pezzelo for justice and human rights he is amazing great guy who cares about his students take home midterm and final which is really easy if you take notes and utilize his office hours come to class sign in and leave whenever you want attendance is mandatory he shows alot of movies taking him for two classes next semester
4.0,M,yes this is a good class if you like to slack off you definitely have to come to every class he shows alot of movies i did go to every class and took notes which made it really easy to write the papers but you can just easily google the information too i enjoyed his class if you bother going you can learn some things
5.0,M,taken three of classes he is very easy to understand and make the subject matter interesting he is always willing to answer questions he is very clear on what will students will be tested on and provides handouts for guide purposes
5.0,M,filson is great humorous and friendly he is incredibly helpful and smart has a phd in the subject he seems to understand that students take this intro class simply as a requirement so he emphasizes learning general ideas rather than minute details that will be forgotten by anyone not a geology major
4.5,M,my favorite teacher so far he made geology fun and interesting and helped you anytime you needed it field trips were easy very fun class
4.0,M,lighthearted and fun he makes math interesting he tends to go too fast thru some problems you have to ask him to explain it or slow down only tests add them up and divide by your grade the tests are fully comprehensive however he give very difficult problems this class blew my gpa and i still recommend him
5.0,M,a great take his time to explain the test are stree free and so i his u take he give you credit if ur ans is a little bit incorrect
5.0,M,bob is the best teacher for math i dont like math but he made it fun and easy to understand would definitly recommend taking him the tests come write out of the textbook he will stay after class if you need help

5.0,M,bob teti was a very good teacher he explained the topic his notes really help you on the test and he tells you exactly what is going to be on the tests homework is not mandatory but he will s about the homework would highly recommend taking him for math
5.0,M,mr teti is one of the best teachers period i wish he taught everything cool easy going kind helpful great at explaining the work and this helps you get it just all around great oh and the work was modest and exams pretty easy and im no math him over the others
5.0,M,this guy could cut class with his adonis like stature if you know what i am saying good teacher very clear with instructions and just as helpful i took two exams and did my homework homework is not graded but it will help you in the long run hardest nips this side of the mississippi
3.5,W,i took mythology with shelia and it was a difficult class she gives tests and a paper the tests cover a ton of material and are difficult to do well on we really discuss the reading only the but the tests were mostly on the reading very frustrating plan on studying weeks in advance to get it all
2.5,W,do not take her it will be the best decision you ever make class is extremely boring all she does is sit at her desk and read off her notes you even have to read the books she assigns her teaching style is inexplicably flawed some aspects of this class are but you will regret taking this class with her
3.0,M,recommend him but its not impossible to pass his class i dropped it and am taking frank and farrar take those two guys if you can
1.0,M,i like his teaching style he is very vague when he teaches he once sent an e-mail to all students sorry missed class i was busy i thought that was so rude i dropped his class after that episode i would suggest another biology teacher
1.0,M,i had him years ago and i can honestly say he is not good at teaching i have no idea where volstate finds their biology teachers but they need to start looking elsewhere
5.0,M,mr schbig is a super nice teacher he will help you in any way if you just ask his lectures are kind of boring but he gives you power point notes and reads straight from them all of the test are simple as long as you study the notes given to you human anatomy is a hard class and he understands that he really breaks things down for you great
3.5,M,i signed up to take a science class not a sermon that ridicules current scientific theory his answer for how things came about is god did it he originally ridiculed evolution but he finally taught some science and briefly touched on evolution but after class he held a meeting for the religous fanatics in the class to explain why it was fals
5.0,M,i think he is an awesome teacher i had to retake this class after summer course that was awful dr frank actually taught me something and was always willing to help he does not over-complicate things at all hands out study guides of what will be on tests and offers extra credit

1.5,M,never graded homework midterm took a month to get back most of the questions for the final did not come from his notes lectures or the textbook took hours of online research for each question highly recommend
1.0,M,if you want a clear teacher go somewhere else the first thing he asks people in the class is if they have a learning disability not taking credit for his lack of a teaching ability or vagueness on what we are going to do i never had a class that basically is guess what the test will be on no examples whatsoever but if all the class fails oh well
5.0,M,i enjoyed his teaching
2.5,W,stay as far away as possible if on her good side fine but if she like you better to withdraw early she lets her feelings about students she like influence her grading also her instructions for papers are extremely vague and if you miss some small requirement she will penalize heavily
5.0,W,great teacher very understanding and goes out of her way to help you take her
4.0,M,michael is an amazing prof he definitely picks favourites and his acting class if physically challenging but if you take the work seriously he will respect you for it overall a fantastic theatre teacher
4.0,M,class itself is easy but when it came to actually taking the tests i feel like we were prepared enough for the questions asked however he is a really fair grader and will give you the benefit of the doubt so if on the right track get most of the points
4.5,M,excellent teacher knows his subject

2.0,M,for intro level course he was impossible to listen to i know if it was his odd mannerisms or slow drawn out style but i found it impossible to pay attention in a subject i love the material in class was less than half of what was on the test reading the dry text was mandatory
4.5,M,heywood is an amazing professor he is one of very few whom i truly believe understands the real world and its workings willing to help you out with most anything even if it has nothing to do directly with geography very insightful understanding and helpful would definately take courses from him again easy a in a credit course
3.0,M,he really does make it easy for student however i feel like he has any ability to teach very hard to understand but you need to listen in lectures to pass
4.5,M,neil is a great professor very passionate about students and the material all tests and quizzes are online he also gives you the pdf file of the before hand so you can print it off and work on it with a group before submitting it online easy credit a if you are willing to put the time into it which is not a hard task to do
4.0,W,trish is understanding and easy to work with she is really nice and she explains everything on a weekly basis for online learning lots of reading though and lots of home work she did give a midterm and a quiz only a couple days away nice but hard
1.0,M,this is the most terrible professor i ever had refuses to answer questions he has admitted many times he does not know how to do some of the homework problems the average on the open book tests are always about percent i have gotten all in college and got a c in this class he will not curve tests stay away from this professor
3.5,M,i think well past his prime mentally speaking but he is a really nice guy and made sure to help us in any way possible in office ours going over hmwk in class giving extra-credit open note exams with questions often coming straight from lecture or homework
1.0,M,had this professor twice now for two different classes and he tries to teach the exact same material he told us in class that he expects us to learn it on our own and he expects that we will fail with having a open note open book and partner test and the class average was do not take this professor
1.0,M,this guy is horrible his lectures are pointless he doesnt know how to use a computer so good luck getting your grade he doesnt answer questions in class i made appointments to see him in his office and he only showed for he builds on the easy material in the book to make them not take this prof
1.0,M,worst prof ever class was a lab it had little to do with actual physics if you followed his instructions perfectly he would still tell you it is wrong and walk away without explaining a bit take him if you can help it
4.5,M,this man will reply to your e-mail in less than mins i swear very hard for intro to media industries much easier for internship seminar in all fantastic professor super passionate about what he teaches by far the most useful class i have taken at fordham
4.0,M,he gives a lot of work hw assignments are only of the grade but there are like of them in one he is a fantastic professor who encourages students to be both analytical and critical about the media industries today very engaging lecturer never a dull moment midterm final are long and really overwhelming you learn a lot
5.0,W,i took her week course and to be honest i was scared out of my mind on my first day with her tough but she definitely knows what talking about this was my second time in the course the first time i withdrawled because i was failing and the second time around i got an a i recommend her for sure
2.0,W,very livid about students talking during class she seems like an ignorant person i would not take her if i was you
4.0,W,today was my first day with this teacher and i can already tell this course is going to be a tough one she seems like a very nice lady but she expects a lot from her students she have very good hand writing and she talks rather fast all in all a little nervous as to how well going to do
1.0,W,also her handwriting is impossible to read which causes her to repeat everything she writes down several times
1.5,W,she is consistently minutes late for class if you miss a class for any reason including death in the family even if you let her know ahead of time that you will be absent you will get a zero for the work you missed she does not allow any make ups and has really screwed some of her students over
3.0,M,baer is baer once acquired a taste for his very specific exam questions you understand what you will be asked in the future it seems like he loves what doing which is a plus you love him or you hate him
5.0,M,anyone who says dr baer an awesome prrof obviously care enough to study hard dr baer is probably the est education professor at rider i wish he taught more classes because i would love to take him again
4.0,M,very knowledgeable but it seems like he care too much about students success he pics favorites in class so its helpful to be part of ashrae and other student groups not very approachable if you understand something and ask a question he will sometimes talk down to you watch for his bpm blinks per minute
3.5,M,think you have him figured out the first day he is sly like a fox he is very good at getting you out of your comfort zone be open minded and enjoy the class he is extremly educated and wants us to be also i recommend him
5.0,M,great professor had two classes with him and he is super easy and interesting
5.0,W,dr williams is extremely helpful and a fantastic professor she has great guest speakers from the professional world and has wonderful contacts in the entertainment industry the most fantastic bonus is that she is so hot you going to find a better looking professor
5.0,M,although this class is extremely tough prof ruhi works hard to teach his students well his grading is very fair and he always responds to emails promptly even on the weekends as long as you attend lectures you can do well in the course
2.0,W,horrible if you can change professors then do it she is so boring she assigns pages of reading a night she is super snobby and if you answer something incorrectly she basically laughs in your face attendance necessary but if you want to do good then read all of the assigned readings
2.5,W,worst class ever first week you learn you dont need to read the worthless textbooks grades papers like she is a english teacher has nothing to do with my major teaching method is as dry as dirt pages of dry reading per night papers do yourself a favor and get out of that class worry about design
5.0,M,once upon a time there was a professor named michael martone one day he got a motley class full of en students some dropped and some stayed and those that stayed had a glorious time in his kingdom once the semester was over the students and their good grades lived happily ever after take him if you have the opportunity the end
4.5,M,he really loves writing and gets really into talking about it and telling stories a very interesting and great person to meet the class is mostly discussion with some creative writing assignments all do at the end of the this class if you are interested in learning alot about creative writing and what it means to you
5.0,M,i loved professor cuevas i will take him again he does expect you to try in his class but if you put in effort to the class he will see that and give you a grade to reflect that i have had teachers here that will not give you a good grade to be contrary but professor cuevas is always open to helping and to hearing new opinions take him
5.0,M,i took nicoletto for tests are straight from the notes and hard as hell you have to know the material you take notes the entire class period attendance required but strongly advised if you want to pass he is fair and extremely helpful lectures are completely relevent to the course been one of my favorite professors
4.0,M,dr nicoletto is very nice his tests are totally from the notes if you study your ass off from those you will pass lewis as a lab teacher sucks though go for posey
4.5,M,you take notes the entire class period need the book his tests are straight forward but annoying becuase all blank so you pretty much have to memorize everything cool too much into evolution though
4.0,M,good teacher very nice guy gives somewhat difficult exams but is helpful outside of class i would recommend taking his course solid accounting professor
5.0,M,dr hovell is one of the toughest but best profs had he is fair but extremely demanding which is good preparation for publishing in the real world one of the best adherers to scientific principles that encountered
4.5,M,good teacher--very fair and impartial uber smart he knows everything about the subject very nice too
2.0,W,while nice her class was extremely boring and she mostly read off the powerpoint often times her sentences droned on to nowhere not very impressed considering it was a grad school level class
3.0,M,i took his honors class he obviously thinks highly of himself and i disagreed with the biased point of view he taught however the class itself too difficult two books lecture material online tests covered all aspects could use the on them for still needed to know the info prior or be out of luck
5.0,M,absolutely the best professor i have taken at assumption he is clearly passionate about what he teaches and his lectures are so engaging and interesting taking gendron made me decide to be a criminology miss out on this prof
1.0,W,absolutely horrendous online class and while i have to do the chats weekly that some others mention i can relate to the frustration she grades things weeks after they are due her class is completely unorganized and she never responds to anything her feedback on your submissions is vague and of no help at all i wish i could rate lower
1.0,W,the worst and most lazy teacher her with the dean it is not fair to have teachers like canceled more than half of the not check drafts classmates final is really a draft that you send by replies telling you something general about your wonder if she really reads the essays
1.0,W,her online class is horribly confusing she is totally unhelpful and snaps at you when you ask for help instead of answering your questions and the assignments and readings she gives are not easy
4.0,M,if you love literature enjoy his class his lectures are relevant to the that we read in need your book to follow his discussions and if you want to do well on the final come to class because his key points on every is necessary to do well on test essays are easy and he will help you when you need it
5.0,M,he is the best professor ever had intelligent passionate hilarious and truly wants his students to do well--and he will teach you how to write not an easy grader but lenient with due dates and always willing to work with you if at all possible take him
2.0,M,save yourself and your sanity and avoid dr stokesbury yes he knows what talking about and at times makes some nice points but his tests are absurdly difficult and he is fairly rude and abrasive steer clear of this one
2.0,M,mean spirited teaching style seems intent on discouraging his students from enjoying writing he give you any grades on your poems until you get your final grade after the semester i failed the course simply because i turn in a second revision of my poems i had worked on most of the semester and he graded them as zeros
2.0,M,absolutely by far the worst professor i have ever had rude arrogant for no reason at all and he is consistently minutes late to class but marks you absent if you are minute late his way or the highway even think about making suggestions the only way to get a good grade is to do exactly as he says no imagination
1.5,M,wow where to begin leon rambles endlessly when he does speak directly on a piece of poetry its a miracle if he has something important or poignant to say rude an ass and in no way at all helpful also too self-assured to ever be wrong so do not disagree with him or your grade will be affected one of my worst professors ever
5.0,W,she is a great teacher she challenges to think and has many discussions you really have to read the books because she does give pop quizzes and they are necessary for the discussions a bit hard on grading essays but you can take the out of class essays to rewrite again for extra points and it helps out with your writing skills love her d
5.0,W,she is fantastic yes she is a hard grader but just because she expects college students to write at college level she will patiently and clearly answer all of your and allows you to revise each of your take-home assignments for credit quizzes are easy just make sure you do the reading and come to class on time love her
5.0,W,professor nichols is one of my favorite teachers here at pcc i had a class with her and i never dreaded coming to class because she made class so fun there were many discussions in the class which is always interesting always read the reading assignments and always come to class early or you will miss out on the pop quiz
4.5,W,i had her at acc really nice fun class is mandatory abs allowed but understanding if you need more she give you an a but not hard to get one i never bought the book i just looked up the stories online definitely recommend her essays a final essay and some easy journal assignments take her if you can
3.0,M,his coursereader is useless most of the content is copied from the book we have to buy it only for three coverpages he also allow us use copies of his coverpage may i ask who wants to spend bucks to buy only three coverpages so he is just a thoroughly profiteers
4.5,M,this teacher is really cool he was a usc professor this class is very easy to compare with another teacher forman mr catalano did teach something take him you will get a
5.0,M,great teacher he enjoys helping students and has a great sense of humor he teaches everyone as if they had just begun playing guitar he is very interested in teaching his students and what they want to become all you have to do is practice playing and you do great
3.0,M,to many students his class were hard honestly he was a pretty good professor and always tried to give some advice concerning our future and goals just study hard and you will get what you deserve
4.5,M,wonderful teacher enjoyed his lectures he gives a hard exam but so willing to help you improve go to his office hours very friendly and engaging
4.5,M,probably one of best professors had so far extremely helpful and really cares about his grades the lectures too bad he makes some cheesy jokes but all good fun his class was the first history class i actually liked going to it too hard just take legit notes and you should be fine
3.5,M,real nice guy and is really helpful if you go after class to see him cracks some good jokes in class to break up the boredom at times lots of optional work that kind of helps out on tests the tests are extremely hard though i would say avoid if you want your gpa to stay where it is at
4.5,M,one of the best professors i have had i would recommend him over any mqm teacher people who complain about this class are those who like definitive and struggle to think outside the box he may grade you lower but there are so many points that it is impossible to not get at least a b
4.5,M,great teacher lecturing is at a minimum he wants to know he has your attention and you are learning many students go to him for encouragement he cares about his students one problem the topic of the class opportunism is and businesses will want employees who follow the fundamental rules rather than opportunities to exploit
3.0,W,in all honesty karen is not all that bad granted she leaves comments and does seem like a stickler but shes ok finished the class with a b and i feel that she helped my writing out a lot i would recommend her class however it is very work intensive even for an online class
1.0,W,this lady has a huge ego problem she doesnt respond to emails when you have a question and when she does get around to them she treats you as if you are an idiot i have never been treated so poorly by a teacher in my life honestly take this class because if you get on her bad side she will be bias worst professor at ncc period
1.0,W,this women is a total nut she is nasty unclear and arrogant she doesnt treat you like an equal and leaves unprofessional comments in her emails she is late with grading and refuses to answer questions without getting mad or making you look stupid i wouldnt reccomend this professor at all im an a i think this lady is an airhead
5.0,M,he is an awesome down to earth guy he is willing to help if you have problems the best professor i have ever had he cares a great deal about his students i totally recommend him for a professor for an easy a
1.5,W,absolutely terrible yelling at students is not the way to teach students she also goes off on tangents to rant about her personal life even though it has nothing to do with the class content
1.5,M,avoid taking this with you will fail lectures are not very thorough he go into detail you will do homework and be randomly called upon for the homework tests are extremely difficult be prepared to teach yourself like all acc classes at eku
4.5,M,such an easy teacher you even have to go to class just show up for the tests if you have a picture on your cover page of your papers get an a definitely suggest taking him
1.0,M,this mas has been teaching the same way for the last years and changed a thing during his time at eku once he hates you he will always hate you get on his bad side there is one way to learn in his mind and that is his way to stay awake in his class is a true challenge time to hang it up dr ferguson
2.5,M,unfair picks his favs a right answer is the one which he agrees with free thought is not allowed not a very fair marker avoid him
1.0,W,you are grad students your not in kindergarten she is full of herself rude and refuses to answer questions when directly asked instead she says put it on the discussion board so your class mates can answer it i pay to have an instructor if i wanted to teach myself i would by a book do the work and ask friends if they understood for free
1.5,W,this class is the biggest waste of my time possible unless you will copy information word for word for her examples you will not do well this is the only place that you can get a hundred on a quiz and score a c on a discussion post
1.5,W,will not provide any assistance when needed she comes across as very arrogant and can frankly quite rude she does not understand that this class is an online environment and dealing with numbers online can be tricky the fact that all of her ratings are negative--speak volumes please be mindful of this when taking ber
4.0,M,he seems really rude and arrogant in class but he is a good professor and i learned a lot the class was interesting even though i did not think i would like it at all i would encourage anyone to take this professor he really wants you to do well but expects you to earn it
3.0,M,he seems arrogant and hard but really kind hearted he understands things and is pretty forgiving for being late on assignments he lets you resubmit when you make mistakes and if you go to class actually learn some things he is a pretty good teacher he jams a lot of homework into one time frame but all repetitive
1.0,M,i thought he was arrogant
2.0,M,classes are really boring all you do is discuss the readings the whole class time he is an okay guy but hes not really willing to help you with your essay he just tells you to go to the writing center hes a tough grader but hes an ok guy
5.0,M,meany is the best fyw is difficult but worth it if you work hard you will earn the grade you deserve analysis is very important and he helps you learn to dig deeper in reading and writing to a level you never thought was possible best class if you want to learn but if you are looking for an easy a snooze course this it
4.5,M,class was very easy tests straightforward and right off the study guide slightly boring at times but his demonstration of what a curtsey is made my semester
5.0,M,class is pretty much exactly the same every day however he talks about the material like its a campfire story very knowledgeable and kind his tests are incredibly straight forward highly recommend
5.0,M,do not leave harding without taking this man for at least one class if you get the chance for an elective i highly recommend his civil war class very passionate about what he teaches and the field trip is great
5.0,M,a true historian in every sense of the word he made the history come to point slides and stories of a personal nature that glued me to my seat considered changing my major from bible to professor
4.0,W,the best class i have taken at harding i went in dreading another english class but loved this class she is so much fun and i had a great time i have recommended this class to some many people
2.5,M,grades easy and is very nice to all students he gets kinda lost in his own lectures sometimes but put up with him and study along side his notes and you should get at least a b
5.0,M,this teacher was excellent he knows his stuff but dont take advantage i had him a while back you will learn a lot besides italian how could he go wrong
2.0,M,has little respect for students he speaks down to all of us some of us are his same age he also refuses to go over the material in a step-by-step manner he assumes we all know what he is doing
5.0,M,love this class we never had friday classes instead you have to write a little one page paper every week on a different curent topic very easy a if you do the papers we only had two test which had study guides and they were all multipule choice he is a funny guy who understand that this is a gen ed class and is willing to work with students t
4.5,M,he is a great teacher his teaching methods are awesome and he will help you out a lot if you are interested in a health major i would definitely recommend him
4.5,M,i believe he has a bad rating on here i loved dr sloan and he was always really eager to help
4.5,W,prof burnham is great she is very interested in helping her students grow and learn go to her office hours because she is very helpful there
3.0,M,personally he is an alright guy but his grading is a bit ridiculous for a level class and he expects a lot from that kinda class its not the best class in the world but if you read you may be okay he gives a few essays over the course and if you can b-s it enough and let him look at it you should be alright read everything carefully
3.5,M,heb is a great guy but not the best prof you can learn from him but if econ is not your thing and you will need some better teaching you should try another prof
5.0,M,heb is one of the best at au he not only is a professor but is also a business man he knows his information you can learn a lot from heb
1.0,M,hey was horrible expected you to understand everything the first time he spoke of something if you are struggling he makes things harder and expects more if your an athlete do not take this class
4.0,M,duane is a little quirky and kind of out there but overall a great professor i took this class as a sophomore and expected to get my butt kicked really helpful though and wants you to do well he really give many grades and tests were very general field trips are interesting definitely a lot of work but it been a lot worse
2.0,M,grades harshly and not clear on all assignments he clearly is very intelligent and expects you to understand everything you say the first time through the class could have been really interesting but he ruined it oh and do not tell him your an athlete guaranteeing a low grade from the start
4.5,M,one of my favorite teachers so smart really loves what he teaches and will gladly help you if you go see him the only downside is that he does assign a lot of reading
2.0,W,if you suck up do fine get on her good side listen to what she has to say and repeat it restate her thoughts in question form and you will get an a ask her about her childhood marriage and kids her birthday is nov remember that throw her a party this is how you will succeed in class
5.0,W,i had prof blanck for american studies i was super intimidated when i first started the class we had to buy a number of smaller books rather than one big text the class to my surprise was pretty awesome and she is super helpful if you ever need anything or have any questions she is totally understanding and helpful great class and prof
4.0,W,dr blanck is a nice teacher but her class is difficult there is a lot of work and reading for senior seminar she wants you to learn and cares about her students she will help you in any way possible to assist you in succeeding
5.0,W,prof blanck is a great teacher i learned a lot in her class the work load was not heavy at all pretty much just reading and online discussion she wants you to learn
4.5,M,these comments are clearly from people who want to put in the work if you really want to major in em and the right place for you you will enjoy dr r and his courses loves what he does and definitely gives a lot of work but it all has a purpose and better for it all
2.0,M,this man makes you not want to be an em major this class seems to drag on for hours at a time and if it required to be there i would skip a lot material is outdated irrelevant and not useful to the current world this guy is a self-centered jerk he has his favorites and if you one of them best of luck to you
1.0,M,i took this guy years ago get out of this major if possible he is an idiot and uses the information that the students from previous years researched does not check for facts and grades solely on presentation not content he will not help you do anything in the entertainment industry that you could not have done without a college education
2.5,M,as others have stated there are rediculous amounts of work for what you will get out of it it is hard to teach something that you have never been involved in much of the material we went over was not relavent plus outdated em majors must take him so waste your time with a em major both classes were a waste
4.5,W,is a very passionate person her lectures are very involved and she goes out of her way to make you want to do better her enthusiasm both in person and when grading made me nostalgic for high school days i however lost interest in this subject due to the content covered not how she taught it
5.0,W,love she is definitely the best professor had at denison she is super interested in the material and gets you interested even when the material can be very tedious great class suggest her to any and all students side note i liked her so much i made her my advisor and she teaches the farthest thing from my major
1.0,W,one of the worst professors ever had her run on sentances make it nearly impossible to understand anything she says she speaks like she is attempting to show off her vocabulary to the students she is supposed to be teaching i suggest avoiding any class she teaches
2.0,W,vocabulary is very rich however that makes trying to understand what she is saying harder because you are focused on her words more than the content the lectures were mostly boring and her constant hitting the mic though annoying startled you awake
1.5,W,professor comay focuses on nietszche freud and marx only and you understand anything she says her tangents make it very difficult to pay attention lectures are brutal and not falling asleep is a chore good luck
4.5,M,took him freshmen year liked him so much that i asked him to be my adviser you will work and he will call you on answers always witty and friendly great as an adviser cares about you as a person do the reading cramming is useless especially against katz not deadly workload but you will be challenged mix of lecture and discussion
1.5,M,he is very hard to listen to until he gets to talking about his own research then easier to stay awake go to his office hours covers the same things in every class but not clear in class on what exactly he wants you to know
1.0,M,jerome taylor is the worst teacher i have ever had for the following reasons he comes ten minutes late to every class he talks in a incomprehensible monotone voice so its impossible to stay awake in class is extremely disorganized he missed the final forcing us to take an incomplete grade take the final next take
1.0,M,this is by far the worst prof i have ever had he is smart but doesnt know a thing about how to teach lies what he says is on a test is not it not helpful in any way when it comes to asking questions in regards to labs essay or even on the subject as a whole he just makes it more confusing
2.0,M,prof mccarthy is a nice guy but very scatterbrained and disorganized he is interested in his field and sure quite knowledgeable but often goes off on tangents and tie it all together could have skipped several classes and still got the same info overall decent though
5.0,M,dr irvine is honestly one of the kindest people ever met his lectures are very interesting and easy to understand tests are really fair
5.0,M,this guy was made to teach i still find the subject material boring so his lectures always special but always crystal clear great format and consistency between text book questions lectures and tests highly recommended
2.0,W,she needs to leave this department she has such a low level interest with all students she makes references to classes she does not communicate with the other professor her basic skill knowledge of computers is limited cant stand her as a teacher
2.0,W,completely agree with one of the previous ratings she acts like she is friendly but she is actually not she choose people to be nice to
4.5,W,enthusiastic intelligent and interesting professor teaches very well and is a good marker she is always willing to help and she is well-read in her field recommended
3.0,M,he never gives real homework assignments your grades are based solely on a few papers and the tests you write he is very vague about what is going to be on the test and reviewing just confused me more nice guy but needs to clarify what we exactly need to know succeed in the class
2.5,M,nice teacher respectful to students and willing to offer help but is unclear on his expectations for assignments never knew if i was doing what he wanted usually a hit or miss situation
4.5,M,not sure how he got the negative ratings but the prof was the exact opposite of what was stated on here prof was very clear very good and the class was really interesting
2.0,M,ridiculous professor tests on subject matter he teach very dismissive when you ask for help worst professor i ever had at ua somebody break his iphone please
1.0,M,knows his subject of expertise but know how to teach his subject of expertise should be a researcher not interacting with students since he lacks the necessary communications skills yes we are all impressed with your boat please
1.5,M,this guy is an associate dean he needs to stop teaching and just go be a full time admin because he a clear communicator i got tired of him leaving class to go talk on his iphone or how he had to mention that he owns a boat we get it you get paid a lot of money but not because a good teacher and he friendly to students
4.5,M,i love love love dr snider he is so slick and neat he is extremely helpful and makes chemistry so fun and easy to relate to his take home tests will make you want to die but other than that you will love your life if you take him
4.5,M,the best teacher at college he is always willing to help his students out and is passionate about what he teaches i would have certainly done poorly in a chem class taught by anyone else dr snider is surely a professor i would suggest taking
5.0,M,professor taylor is a very good teacher and he always helps to give advice on what could make your art project stronger one problem i see with him is that for a beginning drawing course i think he expected more previous experience than some of the other students in my class had
1.0,M,he was a jerk had favorites which he chose the first day of class and if you are not in that group he occasionally pokes fun at you for not knowing an answer and humiliates you in front of everyone says you are making up stuff too and humiliates you in that manner also do not take his class he can hurt you if you are sensitive
5.0,M,one of the best professors had i would love to have him again
5.0,M,i never took his class i am one of his patients dale is nothing short of a living saint knowing that someone like dale is in this world makes me think if i could learn to be half as awesome as him all the pain is worth it
5.0,M,the greatest professor at phillyu no the world possibly the universe i recommend u take his classes every chance you get
5.0,M,taken a million of his classes and would recommend each one love him
4.5,M,todd is my favorite teacher that had ever he is such a good person and makes every class fun i hate missing his lectures if you can take a class with him and get to know him you regret it
1.0,W,in grad school and looking back at all the had over the years she sands out as being horrible more than anyone been fired back in
3.0,M,one of my least favorite professors he is impatient and expects you to already know the new material and is frustrated when you understand he teaches his lectures in a screaming tone-usually end up with a headache afterwards he assigns ridiculous amounts of assignments that useless to the content of the class never again
5.0,W,great prof really knows her stuff and makes it easy to study from tests gives real life examples that help to make learning more clear great sense of humor very honest really awesome person and great prof recommended
5.0,M,this class will stand out as one of the best you will take paciocco has a phenomenal understanding of the material and is one of leading experts he is also an equally brilliant the materials and exams are challenging but absolutely worth it do whatever you can to take his classes
4.5,M,my favorite class of the semester dr borders is hilarious insightful and a talented professor he is very straightforward and take crap from anyone and his tests are a little difficult i loved this class so much that i was truly disappointed when i overslept once
5.0,M,well had db for tons of classes not just he is hilarious insightful inspirational he put up with bad work lateness or attitudes he is one of best and i even think he knows how good he actually is his classes are something to look forward to god bless this man
5.0,W,im very happy i was able to hv dr jackson-jones as my writing professor she is very passionate abt her work

5.0,W,dr jackson-jones is a very well structured teacher she tells you what she wants and pushes you to do your best she truely cares about her students she will go above and beyond for you i wish i had her for and beyond
4.5,W,mrs jackson is a character and she expects you to work hard she explains her material clearly and gives a lot of hand outs i would recommend her to someone who has been out of school for a while you should pass her class with a b or better she is not a hard teacher and do not get on her bad side
5.0,W,i agree with the prior is not high is a great best english teacher ever the negativity because people are more focused on her than her teaching
5.0,W,is highly recommended she knows so much about her really amazes me not only is she knowledgeable but also an outgoing person if you take her class i promise you will learn a lot
1.0,W,this instructor is very hard and shows much favortism towards is very matter how good you think your work me she will pick it apart in a hot braggs about being tenured and her grading is more subjective than i can say is good luck and it will be benefical to you if you stay on her good side
2.5,W,she is a alright professor just get u ready for the real deal so on how ready u think u r for college good luck
1.0,W,i was out of school for ten years before i took her class and would not explain anything she is the worst teacher ever
2.5,W,if you are a student who has been away from school for an extended time i highly recommend that you do not take this instructor she will belittle you and shake what confidence you have in your writing abilities she is disrespectful and a bit of a narcissist
1.0,M,csi needed to have fired him long ago everything you read here is true not only is he an unqualified teacher but for students that struggle-hell make sure to point you out in class for an answer horrible teacher and person
1.0,M,do not and i repeat do not take him he made me hate biology he expects you to study hrs a day like you dont have a life he answer your questions no review and of what you studied isnt on the test only take him if you want to sign over your sanity what a freaking waste
1.0,M,professor scherb was terrible i took his bio course and was so lost i am a very smart person and an even better student but professor scherb changed all that his tests are very difficult he belittles you and embaresses you among your classmates and he flirts with alot of the girls very unprofessional avoid this class by all means
4.5,M,a very wise guy with a lot of studying not only on his teaching area but in general will make you study a lot and lots of non related readings exams are easy as long as you do the study guide will make you work hard for your grade but if learning is your thing it should be worth it
4.0,M,peters was a tough professor he assigned lots of textbook readings along with supplementary materials every class period he has pretty open office hours though really knows his stuff his definitely passable but a teacher that makes you work for your grade legitimately wants his students to learn no matter how rough it may be
3.0,M,i personally cannot stand peters i had him for classes because of my minor he is very intelligent and knows his stuff however his grading standards are ridiculous and as a person a little arrogant
4.5,M,as an arts student with terrible math skills trying to fit in with honors physics students professor tindall did an awesome job helping me out and explaining things in ways that were alternative to the textbook yes he may not be the young hot-shot that buffs himself as the most contemporary astro-physicist but a great professor
1.5,W,took this class online and i have taken online classes many times before by far this is the least helpful professor i have ever had if you ask questions she treats it like a nuisance gives vague instructions and then takes off major points for not understanding what was being asked would not recommend her
2.0,W,her usual feedback for discussions and essays are ok what kind of feedback is that takes off points but not explain why thats not helpful she is a hard teacher and a there is a lot of reading and writing plus some questions on exams are from the next chapter or not at all in the book
4.0,W,she gives extremely thought-provoking lectures and is great at sparking discussion however i say i learned anything new mostly we discussed current events worse she encourages creativity on papers but in grading them she just wants students to spit back the reading and way way too much reading homework
5.0,W,extremely nice teacher she is excited to teach and will help you with any questions you have the class is really easy as long as you go and turn your work in i use the textbook much-her powerpoints are wonderful
5.0,W,what a wonderful lady very excited to teach and be there which is sometimes hard to find with professors these days cares about her students doing well and will help at any cost
3.5,M,ive taken fogel twice you gotta love him get so excited about lines or words in poems and tell us his theory about them that will take up a third of the class always makes jokes about having read things over and over for years come up with an interesting new idea about a poem or book and if he gets it in any way appreciate it
1.0,W,this prof is archaic in that content and presentation need work--a lot of work time to retire unless she could update her teaching style big time really big time take
4.0,W,hard marker that said pretty knowledgeable hard to know what she wants at times take for a first year class
2.5,W,her class is awful hardest marker ever had very boring lecture and disagree with her ideas when writing a paper get an f say reaching from the text avoid her class
5.0,M,mr foster is hands down the best teacher out there he teaches you the course in a way you want to miss any of his lectures never did i find his lectures to be boring extremely nice and very knowledgable he is the only teacher that explained marketing so well to me
4.5,M,jerry as he insists on being called is an excellent teacher and a great man he really cares for his students and has a fun time getting to know them and teaching them holds plenty of review sessions for tests and will do whatever it takes to get you to pass as long as you try sometimes not crystal clear but he will explain if asked
5.0,M,jerry is awesome he really cares about each on of his students his lectures are interesting and informative i found myself actually looking forward to attending i think was possible in a math class that being said his test are not easy if you are gonna skip class and not do the homework take calc with jerry

5.0,W,prof willis is a true class act and the consumate professional she is an asset to sju she sheppards many young teachers through the process in a great way she has my absolute respect and regard
4.5,W,haters stop hating charisse is probably the most real you will ever confront in your lives she is well-rounded and does all she can to relay her knowledge to her students if you let down your guards and allow her to teach you you might actually learn something about yourselves as an individual you earn your grade
2.0,M,yes this class is as hard as everyone is stating i recommend this class for anyone that is a history major if you love history take this class if you like history like i overall he is a really really nice guy as a professor he is not the best
2.0,M,took his class a while ago at scc he expects you learn everything and when you try your hardest for the bewolf essay he will give you a low grade
2.5,M,one of the best econ profs you can get if you are able to take the honors it with walker easier than regular course not a lot of hw he prepares you well for his tests and go to cl helpful
4.5,M,very good teacher professor walker is extremely knowledgeable on the subject he makes you feel free to ask questions and offers clear explanations with that said the material is fairly tough mc questions on tests can be tricky overall i got a good grade but i have never studied that hard for tests in my life still a great teacher
2.0,W,she is very smart but definately arrogant she expected a lot but we are college students the one problem i had with her is after she read our papers her comments were very harsh and she made me feel so judged no matter what i was writing about
2.0,W,i hated going to that class she expected way too much had no mercy and her comments were harsh she seemed to be intelligent but to the point of arrogance and i hardly ever understand what she was talking about in class glad that class is over
1.0,W,what a waste of skin talk to anyone but her cannot give answers to the simplest direct not want to help
5.0,M,chris is wonderful lightyears away from f lenny he will give you a lot of work but he gives meaningful assignments he will always help you out and never treat you like a pest you must attend class you will learn a lot he is a nice guy and a great teacher who truly cares about the quality of his teaching and his students highly recommended

2.0,M,he all that great but not terrible
5.0,W,great online class prof saunders was really nice and super helpful when i had questions i really recommend taking her class
4.0,W,dr brown as she says is a okay professor she is not all that hard read your book because she lectures from it like a pastor gives a sermon from the bible i care for her cockiness and she only gives you an a if she likes you all in all if you are up for her conceitedness she is alright but i tell you the attitude is a challenge
2.0,W,i love speaking in front of people and crowds but once i got into her class she really tried to discourage me from being who i am i dont like the way she talks to people she is very sarcastic and cocky she likes to talk about herself alot and what she has done she doesnt care about other feelings or what she says to people very bias
5.0,W,she is so sweet and easy
5.0,W,she is a great teacher very organized and she definately makes her expectations clear lectures are well organized and she gives study guides so you know exactly what you need to study for tests you often get out of class early especially on fridays she has a good sense of humor and is very willing to help you if you need it
5.0,W,extremely easy my friends told me it was easy but i was not prepared for the simplicity of this teacher and class she explains things very clearly almost to the point of condescension lets you out early a lot and if you read aloud in class when she asks you usually have to go to class on friday highly recommended
5.0,W,she is the best professor i have had so far in college she is very helpful she keeps this very dull class interesting
5.0,W,i thought she was fantastic organized thorough and fascinating she was very punctual always let you out early and was very clear on expectations if you are one of those idiots who follow concise directions or leave your phone alone for us all a favor and take her if you can you will love her
5.0,W,if you have to take this class do so with dr vanderhoof if you be sorry very nice and very helpful both in and outside of the class oh and ask her about her vettes too
5.0,W,very respectful awesome teacher but she is painful to listen to she teaches this class as if never seen a computer in your life she is always organized you will never stay in class for the full minutes and hardly ever need to stay moer than minutes of fridays do whatever you can to take her class great teacher and good humor
5.0,W,she was the most polite and helpful professor i have ever had definitely take her
3.5,W,she is a good teacher but gets a little crazy and can be confusing at times is much harder than the profs my friends have had in eng
5.0,W,easy professor very clear and helpful as long as you understand the materials in class which is impossible not will do fine on the exams i didnt need to read the textbook at all all i did was go over my notes which was what she wrote on the board
4.5,W,this was one of the most interesting classes i ever took she is very relevant and knows how to relate to students well if you attend class and turn in everything on time you should get at least a b easily
4.0,W,she was unorganized when it came to keeping up with my grades she had errors in her grade book luckily i kepttrack of everything she was careless when it came to making the corrections but she finally did she criticized my paper topics after i turned them in even though i consulted with her prior ti the due date
1.0,M,i took him for we did was watch movies the whole time and then go home the only test we had all was the final that was put together with by the students he passed out a sguide w the answers highlighted and that is exactly how the test was spelling errors and all i went to call about times made a take him evertime you can
1.0,M,please take anyone but him have had him for classes and he talks about the same things in all which have nothing to do with psychology his lectures are pointless his tests are ridiculously hard because he wants you to know everything like a professional but teaches none of it grades are random very unprofessional
4.0,M,his lectures are a bit confusing easier to just study on your own but he is a very lenient grader quizes are open book and tests are pretty straight forward not too bad
4.0,M,excellent professor i think his thick accent might be discouraging on the first day but pick up on it tests are easy and a nice grader the class was very interesting and he clearly cares about his students in the end a pleasant experience overall would definitely take him again
2.0,M,he has an accent most will understand what he is saying but there will be a lot of times where he says something that sounds like gibberish helpful not so much guaranteed a no a math class either good at it or not if in between it all depends on how well you can understand book highschool like class
4.5,M,doc is a fantastic professor obvious how much he loves jazz he plays favorites for sure but if you prove yourself to him as a musician have more faith in you
1.0,M,this guy walks around with his hair-du doesnt know right from wrong gives no chance to those who fight for their grade avoid him at all rather go hooked on phonics then to be taught by this teacher
1.5,M,i tried so hard to adhere to this ridiculous teaching style but ended up getting screwed on his his page quizes he does not even assign that much homework if enrolled in his class read the entire book multiple times and do every homework assignment expecially the ones he does not assign
2.0,M,this is a difficult class with a very difficult professor he tends to get defensive and a little condescending when asked a question he grade on a curve and almost everyone in the class was failing you really do need to attend class regularly and be disciplined enough to do the homework if you want to get a c or better
1.0,M,if your quiz grade hits rock bottom and ask him for help only tell you to do better next time and do your homework without giving any constructive opinions or actual assistance aviod him as a suicidal bomber for your grade the only good thing is attendance is not mandatory since attending his lecture or not makes no difference
5.0,M,very nice and very understanding class is all lecture but i never got bored he takes the time to explain everything you need to know for the tests six quizzes drops two three tests drops one and a final there is a short paper but it is fairly simple i taking him again next semester he is great
5.0,M,great teacher easy and wants you to succeed he makes the course very interesting and will like you if he sees that you are putting in the effort necessary
5.0,M,be ready to work but not impossible class is mandatory if you want to do good he skips around and picks and chooses stuff in the later chapters and if your not there you will be studying the entire book i got an a on the first test b on the second if you get an a on the final thats what you get for the class even if you got
3.5,M,i would make dr chambers a required professor to take if you plan on going to medical school his approach will teach you what to expect when you get there dr chambers is very demanding but can teach you a lot if you put in the work an a student that made a c in his class but i received a lot of knowledge and suggest him often
1.0,M,stay away from this prof i am an a student and made a c in his class u dont know what ur grade is in the class the entire time u can make on both his midterms and make a c he pulls the grades out of his bum do not take
2.0,M,he teaches the framework but tests over everything this class required more out of class time than any other class i have had hours so yielded a c would not recommend i asked where conference hours were held and got yelled at in on the syllabus it and he apologize just called me irresponsible
5.0,W,professor mcafee was a very kind woman who reminded me of my kindergarten teacher she made the assignments easy and clear recommend her again for sure
5.0,W,best teacher at southern hands down prof mcafee is very excited to teach other students what she knows about theater you do not need the book listen to other reviews i open it once study hours for each test and the tests will be absolute cake the terms on the test are extremely easy to memorize booooooosttt
1.5,M,he is a smart guy there is no doubt about that but sometimes you have to just call it a day and realize it is tome to move on the take home exams bad but he relies way too much on the text and explain concepts well and be ready to hear some stories
2.0,M,come on guys give him a break he is definitely hard and if you have questions about the material then you are in the wrong class go to all his classes copy his formats that he puts on the board and do all the homework be fine all his exams are take home exams take the class for his stories alone hes really not all that bad
4.0,M,pratt seems to really enjoy teaching and this is rare his classes this is the second taken with him are challenging but this is as it should be in law school if you are looking for the easy b or a take a class with him
5.0,W,i took zumba with like times it is my favorite class ever i taken many other zumba instructors but as far as i know she is one of the best super energetic always fun puts you in a good mood and makes you sweat like crazy you get a tough but super fun workout each time take it you have to know how to
5.0,W,amazing instructor took her zumba course and it is the most fun i have had in an exercise class choreography is easy to pick up on that is if you do not have left feet if the class slacks off she will give the class a small lecture about how the moves should be done normally her all of her classes are super crowded register early
5.0,W,i thought she would be demanding because on the first day she said she was a tough teacher not flexible but as the class went on all her threats were jokes and everyone just laughs and jokes with her she turned out to be the best fitness teacher ever had she doesnt push you past your limits and she has alt poses if you cant do a pose
3.5,M,let me start by saying no science course is easy especially biology mr wernli gives weekly quizez and keeps only your best grades there are lecture test and lab test the lab test are easy if you study the lecture tests are hard you really have to study your notes if you are up for the challenge take him over all hes ok
5.0,M,professor wernli is an awesome teacher who really knows his stuff believe what others tell you he is the best non-sci biology teacher at sac no biology class is going to be easy if you blow off the class you will fail but i took hours this semester and have an a in his class
1.5,M,for being a non-major bio he give too much information im an student and im border line passing teaching for many years he assumes that the majority of students already know the info good for major in bio i do not recommend this teacher
4.0,W,she is smart but i learned so much she really wants us toknow the stuff before you move up in the major exams are hard but they make you think it is not just repeating the book or her teacher here that does that
3.5,M,reg was an awesome teacher so fun and funny and he really brought the material to life he teaches in a way that you feel like making the connections and really learning his class was rich and seminar orientated so students could speak plenty and ask questions not just lecture great course fun and i learned a lot
5.0,M,great professor study abroad in greece he turned a class into a vacation has a passion for the classics and he displays that in lecture also a really down to earth man glad i took his class
3.5,M,sometime difficult to follow but is glad to help you outside of class provides copies of his notes all homework is due at the end of the semester and exams are take-home overall dr bowman is a really great guy and wants to see you learn the material
4.5,M,absolutely fantastic professor extremely knowledgeable and interesting while still remaining accessible to students class material is conceptually difficult but very rewarding if you immerse yourself in it he also grades relatively generously overall a smart and kind man who is passionate about what he does and has a real talent for teaching
3.5,M,the readings were very difficult and i found it way too easy to get lost in his discussions past the point of no return however he is an extraordinarily knowledgeable charismatic and funny man who truly cares about his students
5.0,M,an absolute genius of a man and not an exaggeration take a class with him and see for yourself he also personally grades all of your papers even though the class is very large he will always help you out if you ask him too if at all interested in the humanities you need to take a class with frederick amrine
4.5,M,the first moment i saw him i laughed he looks somewhat homeless however he is a great teacher clear easy and the midterms and final are pretty much a breeze can turn in homework late and still get credit attendence not always necessary studders a lot and goes off on tangets but good for zone out time easy ge class i recommend him
5.0,M,steve is a great teacher very quirky and he makes math for those of us who love it a little more bearable i work on campus and when he sees me he still says hi and remembers my name even though been a few semesters take him if you have the chance
2.0,M,steve is really nice and sweet he stutters and mumbles a lot really easy class take home midterms can retake them if needed
4.0,M,really easy and friendly teacher students take advantage of him all the time but there is no way you will not pass the class he doesnt require you to be better but he will know who you are and your name by the second class
3.0,M,he mumbles over every word that comes out of his mouth teaches with his eyes closed and goes on random talks all midterms are take home and you can retake them goes over any homework question you ask him to in class can turn in late hw no one ever comes to class and there is no need to he is a guy who means well and gets to know you easy
4.0,W,dr lorden is a great professor this is my time taking a class from her she assigns a great deal of sumtimes she is unclear in her explanation of material but she will do whatever it takes to help all tests have the option of being retaken tests are difficult of her wording keep the book u will need it
4.0,W,great prof and extremely helpful she is very animated when she lectures you will need the book and it is truyly a writing intensive class she uses very few power points and test material comes from many difft sources major research proposals are due that counts as of grade be familar with scientific articles research methods
4.0,W,she is wonderfully helpful the book is def needed although it isnt used all the time she incorporates many outside resources into exams she is confusing sometimes incredibly nice and helpful it is a demanding course so i would suggest to go to class be prepared to start doing real main research proposals are ready to work
4.5,M,i loved taking this class he takes a different approach to teaching history and further wants you to understand it instead of just reading out of a book very helpful all you have to do is ask and cares about his students love to take another class with him
5.0,M,dr hupp is amazing he made lectures actually enjoyable and people were fighting for the front row i learned alot without hearing beuller is anyone out there thanks hupp
3.0,W,her lectures are excellent among the best ever attended as they are very clear however she is something of a brutal marker and her final exam requires coverage of large amounts of course material in a very limited space she is also rather cold in person as if she has no time for you this discourages you from asking for help
4.5,W,she is a great teacher but if you know art well take the class hard but it did like it midterm papers and final or a paper you pick one
1.0,M,folks if you value your money never take him i was surprised at his lack of knowledge and in defense he said this is a grad course you dont expect me to know everything duh
4.5,W,karen is nice and i liked this class subject i guess but be prepared to read out of mike book before every class each class starts with a reading quiz and each week you have a huge homework due tests are exactly like the study guides go to her office hours before exams use problems right from the exam to help teach you
4.5,M,i thought it would be easy so didnt work as hard as i should have he teaches in stories but is somewhat interesting you have to pay attention easy class but make sure you are not sidetracked and actually try to listen or you will have to re-learn everything he says before the tests
5.0,M,unno is an amazing teacher i took medieval japanese buddhism with him this past winter he is the funniest teacher i have ever met very down to earth very real personable intelligent and very eloquent in his lectures everybody take one of his classes hell the university should just fire everybody else and let mark unno teach everything
5.0,M,i love this guy hilarious and extremely intelligent never had a professor explain the material so well and what a novel idea for mcphs anyway he actually makes sure to lecture on all the material that will be on the exams
3.0,W,she is nice
1.0,W,take early childhood education diploma at langara college she is the worst and terrible instructor in the world
1.0,W,she is the worst teacher ever had seriously not sure how she got her teaching degree or if she even has one lectures are random and hard to follow confusing and unfair grading scale just try to pass her class
5.0,W,val knows her stuff teaches it in her own style and lets you know what is expected on assignments follow her notes and advice and you will do well
5.0,W,the best professor had at clark very smart passionate about what she teaches and very approachable i read other comments and as if they had a different professor go figure the one i had was absolutely wonderful
4.0,W,sarah is one of the best professors at clark she is enthusiastic about teaching incredibly intelligent and very warm-hearted and helpful she is very inspiring and i would reccomend any one of her classes
1.5,M,i deserved an a in this class i was the only person who participated on a consistent basis and even corrected professor at times he gives out participation points times randomly he gave me a b because i missed one of those days i got an a on my work yet i got a b in the class he royally screwed me over i should have a person above him
4.5,M,great professor an easy class if you do the following listen learn and pay attention to detail in what he expects on papers a very fair professor and is willing to help a student at anytime i highly recommend him
2.0,M,not a bad professor by any means but did not pique my interest in se asia what angered me about him was that he seemed to really enjoy making students as uncomfortable as possible at times especially when he knew that no one had actually done any would not recommend unless you have an inherent interest in se asia
3.0,M,just look at the powerpoints he posts on beachboard and be okay for his exams rarely used the books he a video during classes he does care about his students so be afraid to ask him anything he tends to give the same grade you get on your first exam on the rest of your exams so do well on it
3.0,M,he either lectures the whole time or plays a video all powerpoints you need are on beachboard which are so helpful for the exams not everyone attends class but he truly hopes his students do well in his classes so he does care about his students not a super easy class but it is possible to get an a i need the books
2.0,M,i had no problem with his class it was a pretty fair class for a course i liked that his expectations too much he assigned book on which you have to write an essay it was a very interesting book the exams were fact-based essays as long as you know what happened good you have to know dates
4.0,M,fox is a really good professor but you have to pay attention to catch his sense of humor
3.5,M,paul is very very very good at what he does very open and responsive to students he was our dept chair for years helped erect multi-million dollar music buildings and we love his bill cosby sweaters
4.0,M,dennis is nice and means well but is iffy as actor and director he does teach you some things but he has very jaded opinions that he presents as gospel so you kind of have to predict those weird opinions and make theatre that fits them by sheer luck to get support in class out of touch with the field which is his biggest problem
4.5,M,he is a great teacher i enjoyed going to class and listening to what he had to say he is an easy teacher if you do the work
4.5,M,to the person who said rude and not a good prof wrong sure he have patience for the people who try and are forever behind but their fault not his if you actually want to learn the language take him very nice funny and helpful if you try and make sure you learn he really loves what he teaches
5.0,W,god i love her tests are very open-ended and she assigns mini tests before class to give you the main points of the reading she ran the class so brilliantly that the three hour class went by very quickly awesome grading system easy a very helpful
1.5,M,do not take this class online hie pretentiousness is unbearable and he rarely provides feedback to help you understand so you can develop as a student his lectures are unclear on the blackboard software and never get where you are supposed to go with your comments because of this senior with a gpa just do it
2.0,M,his lectures put me to sleep he needs to be a little bit more exciting
3.0,W,took lit in class assignments are easy homework should be easy but she expects essays to be written like an grader i am an a english student and i got cs on some of the essays i turned into her however she allows you to rewrite papers for a higher grade final was super easy she comes off as rude sometimes
4.0,M,had for both con laws very enthusiastic about the material and that makes a world of difference look if you are a bigot federalist society type you might not like this class unless you like having your ideas unabashedly liberal but you will learn the material he can be a bit pompous and aloof
3.5,M,exam was ridiculously hard good teacher and interesting class but often talks down to students slow to return emails be prepared for his grading he gives out a lot of and very specific on exam hour exam by the way
4.0,M,he was tough but interesting
5.0,M,as others have said edgerton is funny but that make him the coolest teacher ever he goes on long rants and requires that you learn his opnions his tests are unprofessional and he can sometimes be insulting to certain groups he is easy and grades on a curve but his class is very tedious your choice
4.0,M,wayy cool funny if you actually listen to what he has to say actually knows what hes talking about easy a if you attend class just sit in the front so you can hear him i recommend
4.5,M,edgerton is great really easy class he gives out the answers to the test the class before each test so you only have to take notes then he assign homework and he can be pretty funny he lectures all class but it bad highly recommend
4.5,M,if you put in the effort you do well not sure about a lot of the questions on the exam i felt like i did well and got a c but with an open book test you need to study a lot more than you think he has high expectations for understanding material and will get easily pissed if you know the material when called upon
4.5,W,great professor con law is fairly muddled as it is but she does a good job clarifying very helpful during office hours really call on students but likes students who participate so volunteer con law ii was even better than con law i so stick with her very nice prof
5.0,W,loved this class i felt that this class should be deemed necessary for all people who ever plan it may be seen as a guidebook through early childhood buy book not necessary test based on lectures but she is amazing
5.0,W,a really nice smart and polite person she is strict on attendance but the textbook is rarely used since all exams are based on her lecture there are three question texts and research papers that too difficult other than that there any homework take good notes and do fine
5.0,W,fun funny and well organized she is a great teacher taken her for psy also and i enjoy how she maintains the same structure throughout her classes highly recommend
5.0,W,mrs gregg is very nice very thorough she writes detailed notes on the board to accompany her lectures i recommend the buying the book as there is some info on the tests that she put in the notes her tests are bit tricky multiple choice but still tricky one option will be a b only another will be all of the above
5.0,W,judy gregg was an amazing teacher no need to get the book all tests are directly from the notes she is such a sweet careing woman totally approchable and willing to help out her students her teaching method is outlines and labs very high-schoolish easy tests multiple choice and common sense
5.0,M,detweiler is genuinely nice and means well with everything that he does that being said he will not let you bs your way through choir a professional and expects you to begin viewing music as your future profession as well bring your music get your notes stop by his office and say hi sometime smile and wave in the hall love you
2.5,M,i think he really cares but is just extremely awful showing it likes to do everything himself which does not leave much time to help students so you would need to book a time convenient for him look forward to your quartet which is recorded and graded if you are good at sight-reading and sulfege you would do well sorry for the newbies
4.5,M,dr d is kind-hearted and passionate about choral music he takes a genuine interest in those students who prove interest in his classes he does not reward sarcasm but delights in respect he expects excellence and prides those who take the extra time to practice their parts outside of regular class time oh how i love to sing
5.0,W,professor adams is very friendly she likes to help her students to succedd i very much enjoyed being in her class her assignments are easy as long as you stay on top of the work she gives
4.5,W,i love her class is always trying to find a way to help the grade go to its max she is super fun and her class isnt hard at all
3.0,M,a info crammer pure he will assign a chapter and a quiz after each class which is easy to skate by is unmerciful and lets satan write tests
2.5,W,lecture is boring she has pictured from textbook in powerpoint and she explains them recitations are very important they are guaranteed to be in the test no reviews so going to lecture gives a sense on on the test she has difficulty explaining thing but go to her office if u need help
2.0,W,wish i looked this site choosin her class bc comments r right on target i read every single chapter covered did every single hw problem studied a great deal ended up with b she knw answers most questions asked by students her lectures r useless she uses images from textbook only in slides exams are hard beware
1.0,W,worst in the chem her class if you can
5.0,M,mckibben is the man though i think he is a little too smart sometimes i have trouble following his thought process which is lightning fast so us slower beings tend to get lost on the first try
4.0,W,not going to do choir again but i did enjoy the class great and if a music major love her
1.0,M,thinks hes better than he is
4.0,W,she was very nice and the class was extremely helpful in teaching me new and interesting things
4.0,W,kristine is a nice lady who tries to make things fun plays a song before each class and relates it to lecture and goes the extra mile to help has open chats online right before tests posts lecture slides on icon you need to buy a clicker like she says you do
1.5,W,not making clear or very logic point you feel like you know every word she says but it just make little sense not helpful in understanding the major need redesign
5.0,M,john burton is by far the best professor i have had at this college i plan to ask him to be my adviser and because of his teaching i have decided to major in anthropology he supplements his class with his own studies and so he is a master of the material if you want an easy class that will expand your mind give it a try
2.0,W,she is not a strong teacher i did not learn very much in her class she disrespects graduate students if you are looking into graduate school avoid applying to this professor
3.0,W,very nice lady she rambles so you need to pay attention to the important stuff exams are not bad she gives study guides there are four exams no final and she gives extra credit at the end of the semester if you read you will do fine in her class she grades fairly and is willing to work with you
4.0,W,extremely nice lady five exams and one paper good class but way too much material she needs to lessen the amount but get more in depth lectures are interesting but really fit tests tests seem more like a memory exercise she takes attendance so miss more than three classes i got an a
5.0,M,i hated the class but professor fox was really helpful he was incredibly nice and super patient he was a joy but glad the class is over
5.0,M,he was probably my favourite prof at waterloo
4.5,M,he was a funny excellent professor he made the material interesting
5.0,M,great professor probably one of my favorite professors at conn he presents his material in a clear and concise manner while also trying to add a little humor to it had him for two classes and wait to take more with him
4.0,M,i love professor vyse he is adorable and funny and makes class interesting i definitely recommend him for any psych class i had his for and and he is just an amazing teacher

4.0,M,took the online class very time consuming not to mention you must buy of his textbooks which cod even carry i got an a because i sucked up in the papers i wrote you have to write an word essay a week his book compassion is very difficult to understand really struggled through the whole thing reccomend him for online
4.0,M,the online course was very time consuming watch movies read his book and write a paper each week the material is interesting i feel like i did learn quite a bit but would have learned more in a classroom setting syllabus is clear you know what is expected from the start
5.0,M,hes an awesome professor i had him as an advisor too he is very descriptive in his teaching and is very helpful hes very accomodating when it comes to extra help you can tell he really loves teaching biology i would really recommend taking him his class is tough and so are his but its manageable
5.0,M,nicest man ive ever met in my life all of his papers for religion in literature were about ourselves it helped you figure out who you were as a person and it was a very helpful course to take during my freshman year of college i have nothing but great things to say about him and his class
4.5,M,dr lissemore is the best he will do anything for his students and works extremely hard for you be prepared to work hard as well and come to learn any class he teaches is completely worth your time
5.0,M,i have learned a lot i really like him
5.0,M,one of the two best teachers had at cal very very smart and he explains science in a way easy for humanities types like me to understand super-nice guy too highly recommended
4.0,M,i liked prof sposito a lot even though i took this class for hass i found myself enjoying lectures a lot more he was organized passionate and really laid back you get the feeling he really cares about the subject and his students
5.0,W,why did they let her go
1.0,W,completely worthless class did not learn anything her critisims of your speech is vague and plays favorites with her class if she likes you you will get a good grade if you do not show the level of interst that she believes you should you are in for a long semester wish i had taken steele instead
5.0,M,he tries to be funny but he is a tough midterm and finla are sooooooo hard
5.0,M,awesomee are exactly what he says they will be in is my time takin stats the first one i had with is easier
5.0,M,i had him again for still the same nice prof content is slightly tougher but not bad he ensures ppl understands and sometimes adds some humor quizzes were easy but his midterm was tough most of the class suffered but he was fair on marking the spss project and quiz just practice the hw qs and ask help helpful btw when needed
5.0,M,he is a very good teacher good speaker and funny too most of his quizzes you just need the calculator which he teaches how to use goes over the examples in class well got before exam but after i jsut dropped he co-wrote the exam but it was way too hard in my opinion most people that had a going in dropped to bs and cs
5.0,M,people who are saying hard are probably really dumb this course is a joke especially with him the calculator does everything for you his are super easy just attend class and study off his examples and get a easily a really good prof and is also very funny i highly recommend taking him for stats
3.5,M,this tests are ridiculously hard most of the time i understand what he was asking for on the tests studying from the textbook help at all
2.0,M,have to go to class all the time although the marks are entirely exam based which kind of sucks he seemed like rather be somewhere else than teaching students helpful and open to criticism
3.5,M,ah he was a nice guy who is definitely passionate about the subject approachable content was challenging which mix that great with the marking system midterm exam but i walk away liking it you know he even said thanks once when i held the door open for him which is more than i can say about other profs p
2.5,M,clearly would rather be doing his own research than condescending to teach very opinionated and not tolerant of other opinions assigns his own articles for readings lectures are deadly boring does decent prep before midterm final but the tas marked pretty tough
5.0,M,dr glanville is the best the complaints listed here make sense only if you are not interested in doing philosophy in a rigorous and fulfilling way if you have a chance to take him do it
5.0,W,priverida has strong teaching skills but she is a hard grader---not bad to look at either
3.5,W,shea is a great woman and is really passionate about spanish and the different cultures and places i just wish there was more in class conversation as the class is dependent on writing with the workbook journals and paragraphs basically turn everything in on time and you can do well her tests difficult if you pay attention in class
2.0,W,very friendly teacher and lots and lots of hw presentations last one is worth dairies are a must do not miss if you are going for a a worth of your grade all of class time is working in the book with your partners and presenting it to the teacher she calls on you with cards that have your name although classwork is not graded
4.5,W,she is a great teacher i took her last semester and she became very fermliar with all the students very fast by learning our names faster then most teachers her lectures start at the begining of class and end at the end of class she wastes no time during the class time even this semester she stops and talkes to me see how im doing over all gre

1.0,W,i hated this class it was so pointless and she often contradicted herself and the ta gave conflicting information the midterm was easy but the papers are so ambiguous even with her verbose notes in the syllabus and on handouts avoid at all costs
5.0,W,she is a challenging professor but is incredibly organized and one of the best professors at au if you have questions you have to go to her but then she will do everything she can to help you work out the question if you want an easy a this the class for you but if you truly want to learn how think and create an rd one of the best
4.5,M,mark is one of the most influential professors i have ever had i look up to him as a father figure he is extremely knowledgeable and wise very traditional and passionate at what he does
4.0,M,i think mark assumes that art students are here to our asses off that what here for i know you tell me mark is the best professor had in the department positive open-minded and helpful pretty old school but he is extremely knowledgeable if he like you you must suck sorry
5.0,W,best spanish professor had she loves her students keeps the class entertained and is a wonderful teacher

4.5,W,great teacher very funny and easy to talk to i have her for soc right now you need a book unless you want to read more in detail otherwise she writes everything you need to know on the board she takes attendance randomly but if you go to class you get the notes anyway

3.0,W,been teaching for years excellent at it she cares about her students you will have to do speeches if you pick topics that are compelling that no one else in the class would even think about doing then you will pass her class with a good grade not easy a though you will have to work for it
2.0,M,he over explains stuff to the point were even the smart students get confused he also does his math wrong sometimes and does not realize it unless you bring it up do not recommend unless you like to argue with your professor or you are good at math i got the highest grade in my class only because i taught myself
2.0,M,he knows a lot about what he teaches however telling others of what he knows isnt a strong point of his each class there is at least one quiz they are worth points each and questions although there are so many if you get questions wrong your already at he drops the lowest grades but in the long run it doesnt help
3.5,W,she has interesting lectures on the topics espcially on water had us reading a couple of books outside of class that changed my mind about water in florida i would recommend her for future courses

2.0,M,he likes to talk about his cat and diareha

1.5,M,he brags about his accomplishments a lot instead of covering material that needs to be covered he is always at least minutes late to class but if you leave he holds it against you he loses assignments frequently and take fault even though there are people with missing assignments
1.5,M,if this class had been for law students and a full year it would have been fine but important sections of business law commericial paper life and death of a corporation were ignored in favor of consitutional law and current events if you take him be sure to read the whole book

5.0,M,i also agree that he is one of the best cheg professors in the department i love that not only is he knowledged in the material but that he can actually get his point across clearly versus some other cheg professors every class was exciting in some way oh and the best dresser o
5.0,M,best professor ever had the only class stayed awake in and actually gone to regularly he is also very friendly outside class and has the coolest accent
5.0,M,best professor i have ever had here he should teach the rest of the professors in the engineering department how to lecture
3.0,M,he is good at teaching but speeds through material too fast and assigns of pages of readings to fill in the gaps which help on tests subject interesting like the red stripe guy in the commercials
3.5,M,while this may have been one of the most boring and dry classes ever had i did learn a lot from him very concept-oriented which i guess you either love or hate and man he loves those steam tables a little too much
3.0,M,he is alrite but since i was not interested at all in the subject material i was generally bored tests have a lot of multiple choice questions and short answer questions so it is not just solving problems
4.0,M,theres really nothing wrong with him he does teach concepts not plug-and-chug you can get an a if you just know of formulas covered going in to the exam he has a lot of cool demonstrations and relates material to real life situations that he uses his free time researching for us

1.0,M,dr millikin is a horrible lecturer he has favorite subjects that he talks about everyday and basically you are left to read the book yourself to know anything that might be on the test he encourages people to ask questions but when you do he answers you like you are stupid for not knowing
5.0,W,hysterical very clear will repeat fingerspelling as many times as needed for people to understand just wish she enforced voice off a bit more

4.0,M,i want to become this man had a couple of classes with him and simply amazing in upper level courses expect to write something every week but let that scare you off really not a strain
4.0,M,thought the class was very good he can be a bit monotone at times but the converstaions are always interesting for a intro class i would say it was great the tests can be a little challenging but they are managable overall i suggest this course
4.0,W,very still a great teacher she makes the subject fall asleep in her class once p

4.0,W,fair needs to loosen up some as she is very rigid not real personable but good as a teacher with a genuine interest in wanting us to succeed
5.0,W,she was very interesting with her stories which kept me awake for that hour i learned the most from her than any other professor she wasnt the easiest of professors to follow because you actually had to go to class to get the information but she did her job
1.0,W,i was going to become a psychologist until after taking her classes by the end of the class i would have got an a on what her life was about her family and her trips to london a waste of time trying to learn about the actual topic cause she also goes on about herself
1.0,W,she was the worst teacher i have ever had she took something i loved and made me hate it all she talks about is her kid and herself we all had to teach ourselves the entire course do not take her course
3.5,M,my only advise is to do the example problems and tests he takes the test questions directly from them
3.0,M,lectures are boring and so hard to follow but it is just all math so its hard to blame him for that book is very helpful i pulled an allnighter the nite before second test just reading the book and got almost without ever paying attentionin clas
3.5,M,really great when he makes a mistake on the board and corrects it minutes later but propogate that correction through everything else but in general thermo is really really hard so tough to blame him
3.5,M,an all right teacher his diagrams are really helpful and if you have a question he does his best to answer it the only problem is that he give out any handouts he expects you to read the entire textbook
3.0,W,very and very only lasted one each student has to decorate a poster and dress the can get called to see why i in class and yelled and lectured me when i told her i dropped it
3.5,W,she was nice but way to bouncy for me everything had to be done her way exactly she should realize there are different styles
5.0,W,amazing teacher very knowledgable about the industry put in the effort and you will get a good grade try and slide through without doing the work and get the grade you deserve the material can be hard but she has a great grasp on it
5.0,W,i really liked kaci she taught pretty well and i felt like i got a good grasp of the subject i really thought she was hot so maybe that had something to do with it i could not take my attention off her
2.0,W,she acts like questions take up her time why are you teaching say something along the lines of well right in the middle of something but if fast then laugh like you misunderstood her standoffishness and shes really
4.5,W,kaci is a great teacher true you dont have the time to complete projects out of class all are done in class but she helps you and has no problems getting back to you with any questions
4.5,M,an awesome teacher but it takes a while to understand how he teaches do your and ask questions and do fine but most importantly study for the final totally different

3.5,W,if she likes you it is a good thing if she doesnt you are in for it i have learned alot from her but she is very intimidating
2.0,M,i think the main problem was his tests on blackboard they were difficult because half the things that were on the test we had never gone over i didnt like that he made fun of the students and said racial comments one thing tho if i emailed him with a question his response was always helpful
1.0,M,his quizzes were rediculous and he was just really mean and racial to all the students
3.0,M,ok the only negative in his class is the hard quizes on blackboard some of the questions you have to just figure out for yourself he is really into theatre and wants people to appreciate it we watch alot of movies and there is no attendance policy just dont sleep or walk out while he lectures
2.5,M,this man is out of his mind have the stuff that is on the quizes he never talks about he is crazy he also has a reverse camel toe if you dont know what that is just think about it and picture it in your head if you take this class just dont go and you will still do fine
4.0,M,this class was easy all of the quizes are on blackboard along with all of the class notes ok the quizes are hard but he has very clear notes he also offers huge amounts of extra credit the only way to fail is to not show up not give a and not do your work
1.0,M,he knows what he is talking about he just get the point across to people the quizzes he gives are super hard i have been to every class and always taken notes and i only have a c take if you think it will just up ur gpa

1.0,M,failed the class cause i ever figure out what he wanted
3.0,M,he is a sincerely nice man but that is his main problem he is too nice and goes over material too slowly i get bored out of my mind and i probably be properly prepared to take span but his class is easy not a lot of homework
5.0,M,i have had him for two courses and they were both a pleasure i understand some of these other comments while he is an unabashed liberal he is still a fair grader and will not punish you for thinking differently lectures sometimes boring
4.0,M,dan levine is a super nice guy he is very liberal but always fosters debate he is available if you go look for him i can not understand certain students personal criticism of him
3.5,M,okay just an eccentric guy his grading is kind of random but he is quite fair difficult to find outside of class old-school liberal who reveres truman not intimidating about it proud no overbearing ideological demagoguery
4.0,M,levine is old school politically liberal but not in an obnoxious self-righteous studies type way he just loves fdr his grading is sometimes completely random but i enjoyed the classes i took with him and learned a lot
1.0,M,professor levine is one of the worst teachers i have ever had he is a mean grader a boring lecturer and an ultra-lib he gives very few comments on papers and is very hard to find outside of wish i had never taken a class with him
5.0,M,never noticed him goad or insult anyone very kind ultra-liberal comments on papers are helpful but not exhaustive his lectures are slow but informative because he pauses to think about what he is going to say friendly in and outside of class
5.0,W,has really great enthusiasm boring and relates topics to your own lives is always willing to help the tests are pretty easy and a lot of quizzes deal with just showing up to class she also offers like points of extra really needed for people who show up
5.0,W,i think madison is a good teacher she tries to make you think that hard but if you take her class find that if you do what supposed to you will make an a the class is not hard at all
5.0,W,madison is great her lit class is so fun she can go off on tangents at time about jay gatsby but she makes you appreciate the novel even if you like it she respects your opinions if you prove them and is very funny highly recommend this her

3.5,W,i loved the class i took with her and i thought she was a great teacher
4.5,W,was open about her own opinions so we could start off an honest class discussion as equals unlike certain other english professors ahem-carolynbeardwhitlow-cough she embraced different views on the text as long as they were sufficiently supported
4.0,W,eleanor intimidated the hell out of me when i first had her smart can defend her views and expects the same out of you beware the eyebrow of death once i got to know her she was charming warm and blindingly intelligent though she focuses on race i never felt i was evil for being white or that i was graded down for disagreeing

5.0,W,this was a boring class it was tuesday and thursday at and all she did was show us powerpoint presentations that she had made a long time ago she told us where they needed updats but i still like it she was very nice and very helpfull esp for students needing extra time but she did not bring the subject matter alive for me read
3.5,W,she is a great teacher and i lover her in class but she is very tough on grading
1.0,W,if you have her get out of it now before too late worst prof ever condescending not very bright grades papers horribly a gen ed and she acts like a grad course expects way too much not a fair grader and extremely annoying i just want to throw stuff at her when she talks and yeah concerned more with grammar

3.0,W,i agree she is a wack job when i had her she made us have study buddies and thats what we had to do for the beginning of every class we got in trouble is we werent studying however her grading is very easy as long as you follow intrusctions
1.0,W,she sucks totally stupid jumps around and never gets to the point may and she still has no idea that no one cares about her or her class she spends the entire class babbling about things that are completly unrelated to history and she thinks we actually care about her class
3.0,W,easily the hardest class ever taken lectures insanely boring take really good notes her tests are the hardest ever taken and an honors student the tests are mostly essays essays in biology take someone else if you can if you have to take her show up every day and get the book you will need it study as much as you can
3.0,W,she definately makes you work for your grade she is a good professor that knows her stuff but man she expects you to know a lot sometimes when you get things she looks at you like your stupid but then she try to explain it so you would understand i would take her if you know a lot about biology
1.0,W,take her seriously i thought everyone was just lazy and want do their she is not worth is so unclear and all of the tests are written no scantrons she treats the class like a major i did with this her
1.5,W,she is very confusing and somewhat hard the book clarifies a lot at least for me it did bio is a pretty interseting subject but she makes it boring nice and does offer extra credit
2.5,M,has a wicked accent and wierd hand witing but he knows the stuff teaching
3.5,W,i stand her as a teacher that said her class helped me become a better writer that helped me in college as well as my career i owe her a big thank you
5.0,M,he was wonderful my favorite teacher thus far

5.0,W,she doesnt like getting up early thats for sure but ive never met anyone with as much energy as her in the morning hilarious teacher a must have for your morning wake up computer class
5.0,M,dennis has incredible knowledge about his subject and makes the classes laugh-out-loud entertaining and memorable he also holds his students to a very high standard but is always approachable and helpful he has remained a dear friend to this day long after i graduated from whitman
4.5,M,he was a very easygoing professor and very fair he was always willing to work with the students especially if they doing well if you show up to class and you have decent writing ability be fine if you write avoid the class he was also very clear about what he would ask on his exams if you do the work get an a
4.5,M,had a great time in his class seems to take students ideas very more seriously than his own but he wont let bad writing or ideas slide good sense of humor and always manages to bring a personal understanding to the text
4.5,M,if you know a little hebrew than you wont have a problam if you dont know anything its not terribly hard but youll have to work overall he is a very nice guy you have no choice if you take hebrew because hes the only teacher which is not such a bad thing
5.0,M,i adore him he is the nicest sweetest old man alive his class is great all the presentations so far are interesting and fun like everyone else says an easy and enjoyable class lots of chocolate and arts and crafts involved
5.0,M,class is fun we played games the whole time super easy a but when he talks he is so boring almost unbearable i got an a but i feel like i learned anything nice old guy
5.0,M,the problem with bc students is that they study mcmahan is great he give surprises on exams as other professors do attend lecture read the text read to understand not memorize and be fine we do read the entire book but as long as you keep up there be any problems i highly recommend him
3.0,M,hard to understand his are from book and his lecture you need to attend everyday and writes down everything to know what is on his exam his lecture sometime confused you
3.0,M,interesting subject matter but very boring delivery his exams are fair straight from the text he curves grades and gives you the opportunity for extra credit work to boost your grade if you read the text you can do well
3.5,M,very boring pretty easy grader though quizzes straight from book lectures straight from book get a good hour or so nap in his class
5.0,M,a good have to go to class but just read thru the books for all quizes and do the online are very helpful for exams if you take care about the attendence no homework for his one optional term a fair base on exa
4.0,M,he gives a full hour and a half of lecture so be ready to take alot of notes his tests are multiple choice so be ready to study good news is that he gives a great curve
3.5,M,he might be boring btu take good notes and you will be fine dont forget to read the book its very important his curve is huge and its very easy to get an a but u do have to study in advance for it
3.5,M,crazy curve a lot of notes but as long as you are a good note taker then you will do fine i would definately recommend him great prof
4.5,M,a very interesting class there are a lot of notes though the tests are over questions but he gives a great curve a nice professor and gives pretty interesting lectures
3.5,M,he gives two test during the semester but the test is questions and sometimes questions are sometimes weird he gives a lovely curve and you must attend all classes to get a decent grade in the class and the lectures are not that bad besides he is the only that teaches the course
5.0,M,prof brannon is very good he gives exams but they are very straight forward the exams basically consists of class notes be prepared to take a lot of notes and some from the book he gives a great curve if you receive the highest grade on the midterm you have to take the prof
3.5,W,she seem to know everything she is teaching only focuses on what she likes but not on the whole subject not too bad overall though
5.0,W,i recommend anyone who has to take stats should make sure they take with her she explains everything so well and makes sure everyone understands the material very upbeat and refreshing which helps for a stats class especially at night
5.0,W,sarah is the best is by far the best class had at brooklyn college not only is she fun passionate about her work and i never wanted to miss class she makes it easy for you to pass with a good grade just too cool i admire her a great deal she acts like she owns the place cause confident
5.0,W,excellent prof upbeat optimistic and explains the not so easy material very clearly she makes this class enjoyable and fun which is a real feat also she does not have to prove that she is superior like some other professors have highly reccommend her
5.0,W,sarah is one of my best teacher cos she is so enthusiastic and covers so much interesting material
5.0,W,i definitely agree not the best teacher but she is entertaining and the material is pretty intersting her appearcen clothing are great but yea what is going on with that couch blazer its looks like an old couch that she made into a jacket
3.0,W,she has her favorites in her class which i think is right some of her lectures make no sense but she is a very nice lady
2.0,W,i enjoy her class her tests are hard because she know how to teach she goes off topic a lot and goes into irrevelent things because she thinks clear and helpful my advice is to ask her for a review sheet it helps a bit and lets you focus on what to study for no curves and difficult to get good grades in this class many ds
2.0,W,she is not the worst teacher pretty boring but her tests do not reflect anything from the class i never missed a class and actually took notes and also read most of the textbook but still did not do so well if you do end up taking her no point in going to class it help her tests are hard and hardly anyone gets an a
1.0,W,awful teacher you will not get an a in the class unless u can repeat the words in verbatim worst teacher in the department i hope she gets fired
3.0,W,in psy she is extremely boring my advice unkless you read the textbook before the semester began give up run and find another psy she gives you the essay questions just make sure each essay is at least exam booklet pages and front
1.0,W,oh my goodness what a such a nice lady why i feel horrible for saying this but she is undeniably boring--she goes from a to d to z and then back to extremely difficult to stay awake
1.0,W,i truely recommend her to anyone she is one horrible teacher to get she is not helpful at all and almost everyone in class fails and she even give out fs but d which is more terrible ever take her bad unhelpful professor ever
1.0,W,this is the worst prof i have taken both classes i took with her were difficult she is as far as i am concern an incompetent teaher she never followed the book which was confusing she made it even worst please please please do not take her please
4.0,W,nice professor but the exams are tricky this class comprise of class notes therefore you have to focus solely on the book which is complex she tries to help students boost their grade by adding an extra credit assignment hard class i had to struggle to pass
4.5,M,if you show up for extra help when offered at the end of every week do very well otherwise be sure to study the hell out of the material difficult work make it easier for yourself by taking the help he offers
4.0,M,took it in summer physics is hard and he tries to make it as clear as he can if you dont understand ask questions not something most people can just pick up me included helpful and funny too good guy
3.0,M,his favorite word is crap which is kool
4.5,M,great professor very smart he realizes that physics can be tough and will help you out pretty much anytime that he has free time
3.5,M,good teacher though class can sometimes get a bit monotonous if you need help with anything always happy to answer and he also holds study sessions for tests his tests throw random curveballs and are based on important concepts in physics
1.5,M,he know how to teach outside of engineering physics became extremely complex he changes units at least times a problem on tests and goes between metric and us units often confusing
1.0,M,just dont do of his class failed his grade was a c just drop it or take another teacher
1.5,M,he already doesnt care about has all of the personailty traits we condesending self-centered r if you want a challenge be my guest
4.5,M,this class is pretty difficult and he does a lot of intense mathematical derivation sometimes without the basics or non-technical explanation of going on very helpful outside of class though and is a really really nice guy
2.5,M,this was a very boring class he would go off on long discussions about topics we care less about tests required memorizing answers to study guide questions you certainly actually learn any of this stuff overall nice guy though and definitely loves what he teaches
3.5,M,he gives you the test pretty much he has outlines for every section he will go over know these in and out cause they will be the short essays
5.0,M,geosystems great class but he changed the tests from mulitple choice to short essay tests a bit harder than he used to be but a great guy and videos in class are pretty sweet
4.0,M,dr jurs does what he is supposed to he reviews and supplements what is in the text he answers questions clearly when asked it is about as interesting as chemistry can be made the course is a lot of work reading and problems there is a lot of personal responsibility here there are plenty of oppurtunites for a good grade just doing the work
4.0,M,because chem is a lecture class the prof can seem unhelpful but dr jurs is very helpful if you approach him
4.5,M,an awesome guy since you absolutely have to take eng take it with ryan class discussions are interesting not a lot of work and he makes the class a lot less irritating than some other teachers
1.0,W,definitely plays favorites she sure sees the weaknesses and keeps reminding you without telling you what to do about it get anything out of her class cuz she know how to teach i also saw how she was with esl students very mean and unhelpful
5.0,W,the class is pretty hard but a very very good teacher she could see the strength and weaknesses of students she helps students to understand the fields of typography really learn alot from her class
4.5,W,jean is a great professor the class was hard and a lot of work but i learned a lot i think i wasted more than a ream of paper drawing letters but what it takes some people think she has favorites i don t know if true but if you work hard and show interest like you
5.0,W,had her for and liked her everything you do counts for grade in that class making it easy online assignments are easy very nice and helpful come to class do homework hard not to do well in the class best span prof ever had
5.0,W,everything a professor should be so easy so clear on presentations you could basically have never taken high school spanish and you would be completely fine homework is easy and tests are straightforward it would be harder to fail the class than to pass it take her
3.5,M,a smart guy and loves technology most people his age are technophobes so good he knows how to use a computer his online tests are nice because you can retake them as many times as you want untill you get except the last test the final but soooo borring never fallen asleep in a class until i took his class in fall of you can learn some good stuff if you pay attention and a big if very dry and borring class to hard though
4.5,M,listen folks the guy has to teach uninterested students and he is obviously a tech nerd i spent quite a bit of time talking to him outside of class and found him more than helpful and personable if you want a good grade do what it takes
1.0,M,i changed my major after taking him
1.0,M,worst professor i ever is rude and is not a good teacher if you can avoid is class do so i dont care how long his resume is that mean he can teach
1.5,M,probably the most boreing class i have ever had to sit it wasnt for his weekly quizes on bs i would have never gone avoid at all costs
1.0,M,loves like they proved his teaching skills is ill tempered and generally just annoying avoid if you can especially for reporting
1.0,M,he may have a long resume but that does not mean he knows how to teach in fact he was one of the worst professors of my college career not because he was hard but because he was so inept at teaching the subject in addition he was short tempered and rude during one of our midterms he sat in the
4.0,W,she is a great person with a lot of enthusiasm for psych i remember liking her classes
4.5,W,amazingly insightful professor know in the minority here but i loved her lectures take notes know your material ask her any questions you may have and be set
5.0,W,very good prof puts things clearly and makes the class interesting and easy to follow if you can i would suggest taking her
5.0,W,great intructor easy going and personable she does explain things very well and i found her very helpful tests are difficult but fair so know your stuff and you will do fine
4.0,W,i had her for lab the assignments were reasonable but the tests were really hard there were a lot of formulas you needed to memorize in order to know how to do charts etc
5.0,W,great professor clear on what she wants from you i enjoyed going to the class it was an interesting class you should take it with her if you can environmental hazards and natural disasters
5.0,M,amazing teacher that obviously loves what he does
5.0,M,one of my favorite teachers he always had the class laughing there is a lot of thinking and writing involved in this class but overall----very fun if you have to take soc take ellis class you regret it
5.0,M,not only is dr jones super cute also a really good teacher he made me look at the things i did on a regular basis in a completely different light everyone should take him
3.0,M,like his teaching hate sitting in circles and having discussions especially when the people are all super against corporations and they get into these big tyrades about how bad they was too much focus on it got to be quite annoying should have dropped
4.0,M,dr k is the best chem prof ever he gives a ton of extra credit opportunities very laid back pretty cool over all his class is much easier than any of the other classes at least for gen chem try to get his class
4.5,M,he is cool guy interesting as well
5.0,M,dr hamlet expected a lot but helped my writing calling him pompous formal unlike many denison but there for us when we need him if not lazy or clueless he responds to you
1.0,M,i hope a better teacher than advisor after two years with him i walked in at the end of my junior year to ask about my thesis and he even know my name
2.0,M,you might hear about how loud his voice be fooled it keep you awake or even slightly interested in the class ego problem beware
4.0,M,hilarious makes himself laugh all the time funny anecdotes gives plenty of time to read material likes to hear himself talk a lecture class except on discussion days rewards you for saying what he wants to hear is occasionally impressed by original thinking only if brilliant
1.0,M,he was so unhelpful and his lectures were took up the entire class period
1.0,M,take him
1.0,M,gone past being an abominable teacher the problem with professors who let their own power get to their heads watch out for his writing mark up everything on your papers btw like a misplaced comma etc and ask this lousy lousy bloated egotistical prof
5.0,M,trust the last few entries class changed my life and changed the way i read everything those who react badly to him must just be superficial or lazy
3.5,M,his lectures are interesting for awhile but sometimes you get the feeling that he just likes to hear himself talk his tests are tough
4.5,M,he is a nice person who is very helpful
4.5,M,a really nice guy and a good counselor hes very helpful and knows his stuf well
5.0,W,she is a good teacher caring and dedicated hot very hot
4.0,W,she is a very helpful teacher but she is extremely slow grading papers her tests are very hard all grammar good teacher but way to slow in grading and letting you know your grades
5.0,W,she is extremely nice but she expects you to know your stuff her tests are very hard and if you know how to write an essay before you take her class you will fail she will help you in any way she can but be prepared to write and read boring stories like oedipus rex othello hard but good
5.0,W,mrs knous is a wonderful teacher she is very helpful and caring if you put forth the effort she will help you all she can and you will learn there is not another english teacher at ac i would even concider sitting under
2.5,W,seriously what a liberal bother taking this class unless you are ready to write endless essays about points that she agrees with ignore her when she asks to argue your point of view if its not hers you are wrong and you will recieve a bad grade
4.5,W,she grades tough on essays but very nice and her class
5.0,W,she is not only hot she is the bestest english prof ever i heard that if you do the reading and the writing and have it structually and grammatically correct get an easy a i took it and not only was it a cinch it was interesting too woe be the peon who take this class
2.0,M,in my experience dr bender was not willing to help out and when he did try to help me was extremely unclear on every answer he gave me never disliked a professor as much as i dislike him
4.5,M,take bender if you like to argue your point of view because he expects you to try to intimidate you on the first day of class but honestly if you take a pro-active stance on your effort in his classes you will be more than rewarded if willing to learn teach you a lot
2.0,M,out to get you if he like the topics of your papers you might as well give up
4.5,M,bender is awesome if you love to argue he definitely makes you work for your grade but worth it and are possible a great prof and more than willing to help you out
4.0,M,dr bender is extremely hard but the things you learn from his class are incredibly valuable
4.5,M,i took him for speech and interpersonal communication the interp class was harder than the speech but i did well in both be prepared to work he is very helpful when you ask for it i enjoyed his classes and learned a lot if want to learn he is the one to take
3.0,W,really funny but we get much done in class memorize lecture notes and google keywords for essay fluffing as a person she feels and believes heart on her sleeve sort very approachable sorta boyish and grumpy but she smiles
5.0,W,kate is a wonderful teacher who challenged me more than any teacher i ever had any detractors are simply weak in intelligence and tolerance any person who is a true scholar would love her classes
4.5,W,great teacher but makes no apologies for anything that comes out of her you are offended easily take her class i would also not piss her off even though she is one that you can joke with take her seriously when she begins to warn you the whole class will feel her rath if angered
2.5,W,everyone else seems to love this woman but me i do have a little bitterness towards her though because as my advisor she told me not to pursue gd anymore because i draw while anyone who knows me thinks my drawings are actually really good i guess she is just looking for prodigies
5.0,M,i absolutely loved this class i thought jeff was an excellent teacher who really knows his stuff if you are electronic media like i am sure you will love it too
4.5,M,i learned a lot in his class
5.0,M,his class is very tough so far the only class that talked about real world experiences he can sometimes be moody but overall i think very dedicated to the students the workload is a lot for non-emphasis area people
4.5,M,knows his stuff on typography
3.5,M,this class was very challenging and sometimes stressful but we covered a lot of material i think this professor really tried to bring the best out in us he also mentors us in a group of student designers to work in the professional world with clients none of the other professors do that
1.0,M,this lazy egotistical unmotivated sorry excuse for a designer has no business in a classroom take as little of his classes as possible no matter what your focus
1.0,M,i can not believe this man is still teaching he is a joke ever ask him a question because barely give you an answer and then make you feel like a complete idiot they need to get him out of there

4.5,M,i have no interest in sculpture whatsoever cuz sooo costly but daniel encouraged all of us to do our own thing and he respected all our opinon although his lectures might be hard to catch onto sometimes a cool guy but dont expect him to give u a high grade jus a decent grade will do
3.0,M,an ok lab teacher the only problem is that he is not around when you need to ask questiones he is usually in his office working on other classes
3.0,M,professor ibrahim is fast paced his exams are found in the library previous exams he does not place much emphasis on homework little to none if you challenge him be prepared to stand your ground he is tricky so be careful

1.5,M,warning dont take him extreamly inconsiderate person allow you to go to the bathroom treats students like they are in highschool makes his class out to be best devry has i also have to say that i never worked so hard in a devry class to end up with the grade he gave me his class is an elective for sake
4.0,M,fun class nice professor but his grading policy is all over the board no consistency
2.0,M,he is one of the worst prof at uci he speeds thru lecture notes and doesnt explain anything the book was the only thing that helped me pass the class it is pointless to go to lecture because he goes so fast you wont be able to write anything i did not like him at all try to avoid taking this class it takes alot of time and energy
2.0,M,i personally did not like his teaching style powerpoint slides are not very helpful he just lists key terms i had to rely heavily on the book because he spoke very quickly in lecture very helpful tip if you have to take him make sure you record all lectures most of his exams are out of what he says in class
4.0,M,come on people agreat professor he comments about how he believe they pay him to teach a subject he loves so much he easy but he is certianly fair
5.0,M,great professor very passionate about his work and genuinely cares for his students his lectures are intriguing and thought-provoking he has a fun personality which makes his class all the more enjoyable there is certainly a lot of writing to do and his tests are challenging open notes though but not open book so pay attention in class

3.0,M,monotone voice hard three quizzes two exams one final but easy projects weights assignments ie quizzes final smart hard and knows his stuff so if you want to learn take him but if you want it
1.0,M,these is without a doubt one of the worst classes i have he tells us to read the book for the quizzes then never puts that info on the quizzes grades projects and what not easily but its hard to get good test and quiz luck with this guy
1.5,M,yeah i actually talked to another teacher and found out teaching stuff that necessarily needed for the course awful says that if you study do well but he words questions on quizzes to confuse you hard to do well in this class take whitcomb or someone else because englander is not helpful
1.0,M,run for your life do not take him ever
5.0,M,great prof too bad not at york permanently every student should have a chance to take a course with him

5.0,W,great proff clear helpful and methodical but tooo many readings per than that she does a great job i would give her an a overall
5.0,W,unless you desperatly need an easy a i do not recommend this there is no category listed here i can criticize her on the course is ridiculously easy and boring it teach you anything that you should not already know neoliberal this bad for democracy that wto this bank that
5.0,W,wicked instructor y the hell did she have to leave us midway through the year though it cost me my a her tests are hilariously easy trust me whatever you think of them just hold it in and write them and be happy it could be worst trust me i appreciated her way more after she left

1.5,W,either very smart or a very good actor but lacks the ability to answer questions or present the issues to allow first-year law students to comprehend way too much irrelevant reading perhaps she would be better for upper-level students to answer her questions it is necessary to read her mind run
3.5,M,he was not that difficult of a professor his tests were straight forward and offered extra credit
2.0,M,moves very fast and is hard to follow he erases problems to make room before you can copy them down he cuts class close and skips stuff to finish i had to drop the class because i failed too many quizes after getting a b in the semester before he seems like a nice guy outside of class
1.5,M,erases example problems before you get a chance to write them down if you ask how to do a problem he looks at the clock claims he have enough time to completely work the problem and just tells you the answer he constantly messes up problems which left you more confused than you were before
1.0,M,worst teacher ever he doenst want to help anyone and he gets mad when you ask him to explain a problem he doesnt know what he is doing and messes up on example problems drop him now
4.0,W,waterhouse is a very nice person and to be honest you do much work in her class you have to read the notes in class and you will be fine finals and a paper is all your grade consists of but if you work hard you will get a good grade

5.0,M,george williams is one of the greatest guys out there i took many classes with willy g and always found his lectures to be very enjoyable
2.0,M,prof williams ahh what a man a truly unique individual in that you would never know what random thought would pop out during class sometimes difficult to discern what material was being covered in class and his explainations were sometimes as clear as mud not always helpful during office hours but at least he would try to help
4.5,W,great professor shes an extremely nice lady and offers to look at your essays before she grades them to point out things you did wrong there are no tests a lot of reading and you have to write five papers all u do in class is pretty much discuss the readings shes a great professor and is extremely nice

2.0,W,i love english i spend my free time writing and have always prided myself on my writing skills she made me hate this class her attitude towards her students is similar to graders her class is pathetic and she only helps students that are basically failing instead of those that put fourth effort i recommend this to anyone

2.5,M,always pronounced my name wrong oh well if i taken phsyics in hs the class would be super confusing he needs a new teaching method if you already had physics take this class and be easy if you take someone native to the us
2.0,M,if you were good in physics in high school good for you this is so much harder had in now barely passing does not give partial credit grrr not very helpful thinks easy but he isnt takes attendance everyday

1.5,W,b this lady has a stick up her stanford behind unless you are previously from stanford or really care about stanford do not take her class if you have to write any essays about stanford graduates and repeat exactly what she has said in class
4.5,W,she is used to teaching stanford students and she is hard but if you do the reading and participate in class she is not that bad i was not a great student and i walked away with an a in the class do the hw and let her intimidate you
1.5,W,she is hostile defensive patronizing inflexible unsympathetic and mean she seems to actively dislike students if she know the answer ignore your question or pretend that she does

2.5,W,the reasding list was juicy-looking but by the end it was apparent that the class lacked structure and rationale lectures were not always on the mark and it seemed like her tas who also gave lectures were more clued in

5.0,M,he is definitely one of the best electronics instructors ever studied under very knowledgeable in the subject his explanations are clear as long as you do the homework and required labs you should get an a or a b the only bad thing about the class is the schedule to pm sometimes he lets us leave a little bit early
3.0,M,fun and knowledgable person taught the easiest ways to do binary numbers and made circuit schematics look like cake while others know squat the only downside is the time of the class and he makes you stay up til in the evening
5.0,W,she is probably one of the best teachers i have ever had makes it fun she is hilarious and good at teaching she can make it interesting and gives easy tests she is helpful and very nice couldnt ask for a better teacher youll be lucky if you take one of her classes
1.0,M,you never get anything back from fred so you have no clue if you are doing good or not and he cancels calss more and more as the semester goes on
5.0,M,he is a great instructor i suck at the class though and it is mad hard and sometimes makes me want to kill myself and everytime there is a test i get sick i think it is because of the ulcer i got from being stressed but i am getting through it and getting the extra help i need
5.0,M,mr peters is a good guy he is really enthusiastic about quanitative reasoning and gives really good and as many as you need examples i was never good at any math and i dreaded taking this at but telling you take mr peters if you a math person it will make your semester easier
5.0,W,jj made you work hard but she was so knowledgeable i learned a lot she cared about whether her students were doing well even though she seemed strict and tough to talk with she was pretty easy to talk to once you initiated it and she would bring scones for am classes and snacks and tea for pm classes
5.0,W,i love jj i took her for every class that i could she was like a grandmother she brought tea and snacks to class and allowed you to really be able to sit back and enjoy english and literature without having to stress out about your next paper
4.0,W,a very nice teacher and i have a lot of the same views on life and the fine arts as she does she may be really tough at times but only because she wants to make you the best you possibly can be
1.0,W,she is really self-centered care about her students at all and talks negitively about them in class she gives bad grades to people who do the work and work hard and others who care about the class she gives them excellent grades take her be making the biggest mistake
3.5,M,timmer is very nice and seems to know a lot although his lectures contain much actual information one reservation i had though was that he gave us a practise test for the final and it have been any more different from the actual final why even bother
5.0,M,easy grader but make sure if he says full pages that it is full pages you must see plays during the semester and write a small review lots of notes like pages a class period he gives study guides and take attendance great teacher
5.0,M,he is an awesome teacher no homework except for outlines and outside reports he teach you stuff u need to know you get out of class early a lot of times to prepare for speeches he is very helpful in explaining how to become a better speaker

4.0,M,great professor enjoyed his class i felt he was very fair about grading
2.0,M,very knowledgeable but all over the place it didnt help that he wrote the book the only real study group i had in undergrad and that was so we could teach the material to ourselves smart but i feel like he can convey the material his tests are also difficult but fair
4.5,M,the class i took with him was christian history and dr sawyer did a great job of hitting the main points and keeping class discussion on track there was a fair bit of reading a few short papers one big paper and no tests a cool guy very knowledgeable and a thinker he does talk quietly so ask him to repeat if you hear
3.5,M,nice guy class was boring i took it for a filler not a law student might have been the problem very helpful and candid with his students course was just boring mostly reading ye olde english lawe records like shakespeare without the drama very dry cool guy though
3.0,W,took women and creativity and feminist philosophy with camilla the concepts that are taught are very abstract and i would recommend waiting until jr or sr year to take her classes
3.5,W,i took camilla twice i loved her the first class was women and creativity there was a lot of reading group presentations and stuff but if your intrested in womens studies its worth it i bought some of the books and read majority of the information payed attention in clas and got an a b

1.0,W,most boring class ever if the material coma enducing enough her monotonous voice should just about do it
4.5,W,great professor great class interesting subject matter pick a good ta or the recitation is worthless but aurora does a great job on her own the people that complain are lazy
3.0,M,smart man only if he knew this is not a year course i give him an a on what he knows and a z for thinking that know as much as he does at the end of the course your laptop is garbage i sit there wishing he would just ease on his marking right vs wrong people get nervous too man not that cool
1.0,W,her assignments and teaching styles were very unfocused while the reading was interesting the discussions following lacked insight and direction she refused to entertain viewpoints other than her own rigid ones which greatly inhibited the ability to learn
5.0,W,i had her and loved her she was so nice and helpful that it made the class interesting a lot of common sense but you still have to do all the work and study to do well just stay on top of things and you should come out of class with an a
3.5,M,interesting but the reading is very dry prof is very particular about grammer and spelling on essay tests he is a little dry but the material is interesting
5.0,M,he is a brilliant man one of the best lectures i have had very concise take a lot of notes very interesting if you do most of the reading and have an understanding of the basic concepts you will do fine
5.0,M,stoever is overflowing with knowledge and he has that sketchy genius personality that i dig in a prof probably one of the most influential professors had to date

5.0,M,take his class if a not if a woman why not transcend to substance not out to judge anyone personally art can not just because got no talent personal working process style has to been criticized to improve self-involved catharcism is why no one gives a about art we have to take drastic steps towards art that actually rocks paul has crystalized this vision that may never be seen again if been seen before come this unstuffy
1.5,M,a horrible lecturer and a poor class planner but honest when it comes to the art world outside the classroom his teaching style anti-woman but definitely anti-feminist
4.5,M,overall good guy and fun to talk to however his art knowledge is primarily based in the late and says all art is cyclical and therefor has no need to go to see any new art because he has already seen something like it years ago he claims to retire every year for the last yrs and it shows so get it over with and hire fresh
5.0,M,amazing teacher really liked him brilliant artistically highly recommended him a treasure
3.0,M,he is a mellow guy never had a prob with him very easy style of teaching
4.0,M,he gets off track from time to time but otherwise is interesting he certainly is not a bad teacher and you will learn something from his class
4.0,M,aww i read some negative feedback about mr rogers but not true a good teacher and kinda lets things slide just smoke around him because he says smoking destroys cilia but we all know it paralyzes it keep up the good work he is good teacher
4.5,M,i think much of him when i first started classes but awesome if you ever have a question or are a bit behind he helps give him a chance your education dollars are well spent
1.0,M,if you are looking for a class where you learn nothing and everybody fails then this class is for you the longest managed to stay awake was to count how many times he said um he avereage ums per mins but good class for funny like a old shoe
3.0,W,her middle eastern studies class was slanted towards palestinians but not by very far not nearly as bad as the slant towards israel that you see on the news every day she assigned a book a week for a credit week class the roots of terrorism class been called roots of arab terrorism because all we covered it was basically a modern history class oh and we watched really informative and entertaining videos
3.5,W,she is very passionate and involved with her subject she will help direct you towards your own passion within the subject of middle east studies
1.5,W,she promised a tough academic environment but lost many students papers and let seminar turn into personal stories i asked if we could talk about the books she said i was being argumentative and i should keep my opinions to myself my classmates exhibited more maturity than she did
5.0,W,super awesome at everything concerning literature feminism or the middle east great at explaining assignments in multiple ways if you hare having trouble understanding what she is looking for excellent feedback on all writing all around great
4.5,W,i like how she asks for feedback during the course

5.0,W,great professor makes subhjects as interesting as they could be and gets the points of class along very well she moves pretty quick but if you can keep up its all good difficult class but if you keep up with it you can get an a extra credit was also offered
5.0,M,re class size do you seriously think it is the fault that the class is so large and for those of you who complain about his by the book style would prefer he not touch on the books in class but test you on it anyways anyways this guy is a great prof
1.0,M,one of the worst profs ever had lectures were a joke most question that he tests you with are questions that really that dont have anything to do with the concepts studied in his sellout it seems he just wants to know if read it not if you understand it thumbs down
3.5,M,the class gets extremely boring but he change the material although he could make the class more lively a funny man and i really enjoy his classes when i fallen asleep
1.0,M,what a horrible prof why do you even go to can learn all you need to know in his sell out and the book his tests are you really need to go to class his quizzes are dumb and are on useless crap u would usually skip take him
2.0,M,the idea of paying for classes is to have something contributed by the lecture he does not really say anything you cannot read in the well prepared reader and text so no point of going to class aside from seeing slides the class size was large so no discussion or questions a reader
5.0,M,he is awesome
2.0,M,not a good professor at all yah it is college but just ridiculous test are irrelevant to half the stuff he talks about in lecture he know how to teach at all take someone else

4.5,W,lariece is a really smart woman who knows how to relay info to others but she seems a little impersonal tests are kinda hard because all of the questions are open-ended there really a whole lot of work on syllabus either
4.0,M,funny guy take this class too seriously also grade too hard just make sure you put a lot of feeling into your essays the papers are easy all you have to do is write about yourself no research required recommened him definitely
3.0,M,an okay guy with an interesting lecture but on tests he picks the tiniest detail to test you on plus there was a midterm and a with that
3.5,M,knew his stuff and made the class interesting not very approachable
4.0,M,i took him years ago and my biggest regret was not taking more courses with him yes a funny accent and at times goes on a bit but brilliant passionate and provoking

4.5,M,awesome teacher and hallarious his tests are a shot in the dark though and you have no idea how going to grade that night his labs are a gimmie which is helpful the tests are tough though so prepare to study the chem department at vscc is not a joke much harder than mtsu trust me i know

1.5,W,not clear on what she is looking for on major assignments papers very harsh grader this was an intro class i feel that what we were being taught should have been more for a class on the history of theater i received a b-but i had to concentrate on this class more than any of my others

2.0,W,i found darwin to be extremely unqualified for teaching this class though she knows her english we very seldomly actually did english i feel that if i am mandated to take a class like i was with this english class then i should be learning english and not just discussing her life as a teen
5.0,M,thought his class was great just do the reading and be fine study guides are most of what will be on tests good class studied well and got an a

3.0,M,it is hard to understand what the class subject is really about his lec are very boring most of the time he has a lot of info that he wants to share but often are just stories tha tdont relate no tests commentaries and short quizes attendance counts and will help your grade
4.5,M,despite what others may is the the coolest and smartest prof in has been in davis for class normal he is constantly challenging ideas and making you people handle is that he really cares about his material and about his students but he presents it differently
1.0,M,ever he was so boring he listen to students and if anyone talked in class he put them down if you went to his office hours always late and he respect your point of view he will argue with you and make you think wrong
3.0,M,if you can handle a boring take one of the easiest soc classes the way to get an a is all in showing up and participating the essays are a bunch one one pagers super easy and partly graded by who quickly become your friends if you want a easy class on a rocken topic who cares if he rambels your ta will clarify everything
1.0,M,i still have no idea what the class is about he goes off topic a lot and not clear on assignments really boring too worst professor in the soc department

5.0,M,this class was so much fun mr hale comes off as an a hole at first but he is such a wonderful teacher he is a very talented sculptor and knows how to pass his skills on other people the class is a challenge but only because after he gets a feel for the class he expects everything he knoes he can get and more from you

5.0,W,i think that she is a very good teacher for speech i am not sure that some of her views that she might express align correctly with the foundemental beliefs of bryn athyn college but she did not generally express these views in speech
1.0,W,either her way or the highway if her way fine and can be in her club if you have a different oppinion better invest in body armor because you will be attacked but in her defense i think aware that she does it change the fact that she does

3.5,W,ok so this was a real interesting and comical class loud and hyper but her notes are sscrambled and hard to understand pretty much do the readings and participate in class n pass
2.5,W,loud boisterous overbearing intimidating unorganized and masculine come to mind when thinking of kimmelman be prepared for a lot of reading and note taking to be up to speed if you talk to her on a one on one basis shes great and will be accomodating but otherwise in class she is not too helpful and willing to stop or slow down to explain any concepts best bet is to have her e-mail address on hand if you are confused about anything
1.5,W,i remember one of the kids that was working at the orientation recommending kimmelman and this class glass eyed and bushy tailed i signed up and regretted it for weeks you understand her writing graded harder than any other prof that i had and care about what her students thought becuase she was writing a damn book
4.5,W,she is kind of hard but you can make a b if you do all the assignments when writting a paper start on it early and you will do good in her class

1.0,M,he makes question tests out of material for about questions everything bad said about him is true and if he choked during class i dont think anyone would help him
4.0,M,what you should know good guy but the stress of the job has gotten to him you must remember he is at that phd level which he expects you be there with him the tests are out of reach his microthemes are extremely worded in a way you cannot attempt to answer unless you have the time pass
2.0,M,smith thinks that a percent average in his class is a good thing i dropped this class i had no idea my grade in in till about a week before drops he doesnt post stuff up on blackboard his tests are hard as hell his in class assignments averaged out of do not take this professor

1.0,W,very hard to follow she will write one thing on the board and say something totally different she did grade on a curve but i feel like i learned anything
2.5,W,although i hate math i took her because i heard she was easy well it a piece of cake but if you go every day she will curve the grades considerably at the end

5.0,W,i like her she forgave me and accepted that a piece of scratch paper really could just be a joke
3.0,M,a difficult teacher but fair his tests are difficult and his lectures move quickly he seem to have much time to personally help a student but most teachers r fey is a funny guy with a smart wit and good sarcastic humor he is cool enough but a hard microccon class
5.0,M,problem is he treats students like intelligent adults and at ivc most

3.5,M,stokesbury knows his i learned more in this class than any other taken at gsu but his testing methods are pretty archaic from the old school of-chew-you-up-spit-you-out-and-see-if you-can-dance kind of teaching and a dick

5.0,M,mr jones is a gifted instructor he is knowledgable friendly approachable and easy to undestand the very first day he is kind of scary and seems closed-minded but i think just a show to make his point he is always helpful i wish he taught other music classes as well we are very lucky to be able to take classes from such a great teacher for so little money
5.0,M,this is the guy you go to when you want to kick ass if your not ready stay away he will tear you up
5.0,M,steve was the first actual guitar teacher i ever had he has lots of patience and is very helpful will somebody please put a red chili under his name already he is the best
5.0,M,the man is very informative on guitar technique he will be the best guitar instructor you will ever have discriminate on playing ability he helps everyone who tries their best he kinda looks like the treat williams the dad on everwood
5.0,M,easy and really helpful teacher if you want to learn take mean for people who are stubborn or think they know already how to play guitar think again this class is classical guitar and he teaches the standard method strict positioning fingering notes etc
1.5,M,he is really strict and the tests are extremely difficult and he like any students who come late do not take his course
2.5,W,super easy class however i had a major project that misreported it brought down my grade from an a to a b she made retribution but it took more than months for the grade to be changed and became a huge hassel found that after the c
4.0,M,boring ass class he drones on and on about bs the whole time considering i almost never go and still have a pass its simple when your sitting in class it feels like when a cop talks to you if you did something bad and about how bad it was god he is boring
5.0,M,very easy really have assignments except for things like when u of a has like a career fair you will be asked to stop by the quad and get brochures of careers you are interested in and then you have to type a resume at the end of the course but it is very simple all you have to do is go and he is a nice man
4.5,M,one of the best acting teachers around enormously helpful without getting creepy funny to a point that it is hard to focus on the actual class ask him about his cocktail phrases
2.0,M,he is a very well intentioned man and very smart but he has a lot of trouble getting ideas across and there is minimal organization if any for the labs most of the lab is spent on tedious things and you come out frustrated
4.0,W,she is a very informative teacher who really tries to push her students the class is tough but it is worth it the quizzes and tests are difficult but that helps teach she does move through the chapters really quickly but she does have movies and speakers that help with it
4.5,W,gave out a lot of extra credits i thought she was pretty easy but then again i love psychology
1.5,W,did not like her at all you had to do many response papers that had to be like words or something redic like that and you had to go to a nursing home and for a research project like it
4.0,W,she did a good job teaching the class the midterms and final were not at all over what she taught in class also i agree with the other people who said that if she disagrees with your topic she knocks your grade down expect an unbiased grade in this class if you work hard you should get an a though
4.0,W,she made me laugh
4.5,M,definately makes you work but truly one of the best profs had he really knows his material and enjoys teaching it he was always willing to help if you were willing to put in the time
1.0,M,very very hard professor he always gives way too much homework and made us feel stupid
4.0,M,he does give a lot of work you have homework problems and group problems that can be very time consuming i suggest not to take both classes at the same time he does really care about the students and is very willing to help them learn he taught me more than any other professor ever had do the work and pay attention and be fine
4.0,M,definitely works students hard lots of homework and long hand written tests will add points back though if you meet with him about your test very nice teacher just wants you to learn
4.0,M,good professor interesting and helpful he does go off on tangents though but his stories are good
3.5,M,this guy is great he provoked me to think about things in a way that was uncomfortable sometimes i wanted to get up and walk out but that is philosophy in demonstration some were put off by his wry sense of humor but if you are smart enough to figure him out he is actually hilarious
1.5,M,well intitially he seemed intelligent and methodical but quickly it changed with his constant boasting about his iq and his presitgious status he rarely was able to find time to speak about philosophy i felt the purpose of the class was to belittle the students and to glorify his self i strongly recommend not taking any class he teaches
5.0,M,professor afshari is very smart will study you while you speek and be careful do not talk in his hear any little sound overall i would take him in future courses
3.5,M,so easy put a nice cover page on your papers gauranteed a tests are easy the multiple choice questions come from the online quizzes and he gives you all the short answer questions in the class before the test he puts one diagram per test up on the board in class that isnt in the book so make sure you get it and just write alot on the essays
3.0,M,true you need to go to this class everything he teaches in this class on his tests just make sure you buy the book simply to use the cd he uses the tests from the cd and you can get the answers on the cd
3.5,M,another student who only casually shows up i still did well in this class he is quite funny he gives out as on papers like going out of style and you actually can learn things if you show up and pay attention you do have to show up for surprise quizzes to get an a but easy

4.5,M,lectures are boring but you can still get an a if you sleep through them but at times he is very interesting and funny
4.0,M,he is an intresting prof but his lectures are boring however the class is pretty easy if you do the work which is not much he understand students lives which is nice he accepts late work taking him again in the summer cuz he told the class if you want an easy class take in the summer
5.0,M,lectures a lot but he knows what talking about classes were fun and an extremely fair grader no tests but expect to write several papers not too hard though reccomend it to anyone great professor
3.0,M,when he lectured it was clear during his critiques you were ripped apart if you did something slightly off or what you thought at the time was funny he plays favorites though if anybody ever played favorites it was him and you know he always only wanted to give help only to the skinny white chicks
4.5,M,bill is one of the coolest teachers ever he helped me find freelance work while i was still going to school used many of the things he taught me on my last game title advent rising and techniques currently using on king kong here at weta digi
1.0,M,no good has no idea what he is teaching he is also and discriminative to gays didnt he get fired

4.0,W,she is a very sweet lady we had quizzes every friday which she curves participation helps because the class itself is very boring she is not strict with dates there were tests a midterm and final we played jeopardy to prepare and most people got the reading is too much pages if not a theology major
1.5,M,this class was suppose to be so easy and it turned out to be a c for me thermo with griggs was easier than this guy he sucks

5.0,M,good teacher explains the concepts clearly he is very helpful with the homeworks best class this semester
5.0,M,fair is the best professor at this law school he also truly is interested in students a rarity at this place see singer norman and bill
3.0,M,first con law is a terrible subject that being said he the greatest prof either his teaching style leaves a lot to be desired but a real nice guy he lets you know what he expects and fair just like his name says
5.0,M,hysterical also a very good teacher he moves at a rather fast pace you need to do the homework in order to keep up his tests have any suprises on them always give you the test from the previous year by far the most entertaining math class ever had
4.0,M,if you have taken calc in highschool the class can still be hard but not unbearable do the homework and take your time on the quizes they can be tricky his teaching methods are good though he gives you the fishing pole instead of the fish
4.0,M,he makes class interesting although very challenging i liked him so much in calc one i took him in calc two
4.5,M,great professor he is extremely intelligent personable and very hot he keeps class interesting by telling funny stories
5.0,M,great teach but hard class he kept the class interesting however he did not explain maple and other programs used in the class making the class harder than it had to be
5.0,M,one of the best math only is he really intelligent but also really funny face it integration is not most definition of a good time but i absolutely loved the class
5.0,W,mrs talbert is awesome she makes sure you understand the each math concept before moving on takes time with each student to help feel well prepared for intermediate algebra
4.0,M,a nice little guy he wrote the book so he knows what talking about but he will put you to sleep you have no choice though because the only one who teaches this class not bad though just make sure you take notes from his power points and read when he specifically tells you to
4.5,M,really nice guy but the material is boring his tests are hard definitely study more than you normally would he likes detail very helpful teacher though a little forgetful at times his bowties are cute
2.0,M,these classes made me want to jump off a bridge i cannot stand his cocky conservative views on anything the only thing i liked was the project for survery and its relevence to the real world it actually was an important part of my resume
1.0,M,this prof really needs to is just an miserable old man who thinks he is better than you and doesnt need to help you bc you should already is very short with you and mean also is very unclear about every element of the project and then messus up your grades on

5.0,M,he was my remedial math teacher wayyy back great guy easy as hell and then again so was the class total push over caring and nice tries to be entertaining i like him a lot
4.0,M,prof cody comes off a lot more difficult than his class really a class that was mandatory for me i dreaded typical if you are not dedicated the door well i got the b earned the respect of a difficult teacher and learned things always what they seem at first
4.0,W,a ball full of energy this one is she will keep you laughing and interestred in lectures sometimes i found the paper topics a little difficult but they were managable overall good experience
5.0,W,i really liked her i had her twice and she made me think she does play favorites however but if you participate she will like you she is more about the thought behind things than the technicality of the work you do
3.0,W,she is really nice and passionate about the material but she is so boring i could barely sit through her lectures they way she grades papers is very misleading and inconsistent on one i spent hours making sure it was perfect and i only got a b on another i wrote it in hours and got an a go figure
3.5,W,excellent class and excellent professor some of the material covered is very tough but dr bonca explained it well i will never love the romantics but she made them understandable great passion for her subject student-friendly
2.5,W,much emphasis on unknown female only authors glanced over and skipped prominent male authors to spend time solely on female issues hard grader hard tests journals she collect everyday let the class go early i felt robbed unprepared verbose but lacking in the clasics of the period need some new perspective a universal pc view
5.0,W,dr bonca is passionate about literature take her class walk away w an immense appreciation for the same journals were helpful i definitely used them for writing essays exam prep she reads everything you give her makes herself available to students an amazing person
2.0,M,i was very turned off by this individual too bad very very opinionated and take a question for a question and not an attack on his views dedicated to trying to make it through my college career without having him as a teacher
5.0,M,dr c seems to really love his us to the zoo and showed us cool stuff with the was communicating with them also showed us films and was generally easy to talk with out of class i definitely would take a class with him again the final exam was my favorite
1.0,M,i was really looking forward to my first psych class and he completely turned me off it was a horrible experience he definitely played favorites he constantly complained about the core and was probably just upset that psychology part of it
2.0,M,rants about the state of and dislike for the school frequently which is a bummer often vague or one-sided in class lecture i learned most because i had to learn independently in order to defend my positions against his in class learned a lot got an a nonetheless
2.0,W,ok so this is health not sex is a and needs to learn that there are other classes she has no compassion whatsoever and needs to realize that things come up and she does not have any understanding parts wish she would get fired or something
5.0,M,very easy a open book tests just do the homework and ask him to review it in class if you know anything let him know open book tests include your notes and textbook which is great great professor
1.0,W,she lost my take home final had to retake it with out notes or a book my grade went from a to a b
5.0,M,i liked him day of class he said no leaving here with less than a c unless u do absolutely nothing but i took him years ago hope hes still the same but really cool i recommend anyone to take his class
5.0,M,is great he dose make up his own words but kinda funny talk up until the very last second of the class so expect to go home early ever lost of written assignments but easy and easy a oh yeah turn your cell phone off in class or get mad
3.5,M,psy majors beware this teacher thinks psychology is a waste of time narrow minded but you be afraid to get into debates i still enjoyed the class because an interesting topic and he is a likeable guy and he kind of grows on you it was a fairly easy a
1.0,M,who hired this guy worst class i have ever illogical makes up hard also changes what he says as if what he said all along-including when assignments r u an a but it was torture
4.5,M,funny at times tries to make the fun interesting he make become repetitive but he does have good lectures sometimes has tests questions and a final gives you the pre test for each one of those tests he might change about or answers from pre test ready the guy
2.5,M,his test is hard the pre-test is not helpful a lot there are multi-choices questions which drive me crazy
5.0,M,no he responed to emails but he is a pretty cool guy and a good teacher
5.0,M,ballard is the man he only gives you one homework assignment for the entire semester though the tests are questions long often over many chapters at a time meaning if you just read the chapters have no problem plus funny
2.5,M,this guy was ok but you have to work hard he curves tests which is his only saving grace i have a lot of trouble sometimes because he was very unclear about subject matter but after all i guess its economics
4.5,M,if you show up for class and pay attention you can get a good grade in this class attendance is very important in this class when a bunch of people skip class he sometimes gives additional points to people who showed up
3.5,M,geib is pretty easy but his lectures are really really boring super nice guy though easy class to take if you can keep from falling asleep
5.0,W,difficult if you have a passion for english lit she will realy teach you how to write well and she is a very fair and constant grader no surprises

5.0,M,a pleasure to add to the growing list of positive comments for this professor he is among the most helpful straightforward and easygoing members in the history department

3.0,M,i was expecting him to be really bad but to my surprise i had a lot of fun in his class he is always joking around however he does not seem very knowledgeable on the subject matter and his tests were tricky
3.5,M,i actually liked vanantwerp this semester despite all of the bad things i heard before what got to know is that is a tough class but that mean the professor is bad i thought he was a funny guy who really made the class fun however his lab helpfulness could be questioned

1.0,W,good god never met such a self-absorbed professor yes she has ideas but not a teacher she is unapproachable and i wonder what exactly she says to herself each tuesday evening when coming to class because obvious she does not want to be around us or teach us for that matter she repeats too much as if ignorant children
5.0,M,wonderful professor and probably the smartest man on campus do your reading and contribute daily and you will be fine never make fun of his kids
5.0,M,katz is the man he is the best teacher i have ever had on any level he is funny knowledgeable open challenging genuinely interested in his students and everything else that you would ever want from a professor he will quickly learn name and make them feel at home do your reading you will not regret it he will connect it later
1.0,M,i like the guy as a person but not as a teacher he makes you think and if you simply get it he makes you feel dumb i never made anything higher than a on his tests and i love math and have always been good at it do not take if not a math genious

5.0,M,hahaha give him a break math an easy you all should admirer him for being smarta second you should spend more time to study rather than sitting here complaining about him a great professor although lb a hottie but definitely a
1.0,M,if you want a teacher who is polite and respectful to others then professor brown is not the teacher for you take his class if you want a professor who acts too punk rock for the whole world talks to the ladies believes he is god and we are all his servents and is a total geek then take him
1.0,M,i got an a in college algebra and when i got to his calculus class i had to drop out because he was so hard and i have always been a good math student he helpful when we make suggestions and if your phone rings he snaps and gives a hard pop quiz
3.5,M,loved him he totally reminded me of the father off of my big fat greek wedding he was a little random at some points but you just had to pay really close attention
1.0,M,this jury is still out on if his classes are either scatered thoughts of a pure genious or the rantings of an insane man
2.0,M,knows his stuff but worst prof every had a complete nutter goes off topic all the time about subjects outside of the course and makes wide sweeping comments rants every class about how wrong western society is and what a utopia china was some comments border on insulting thinks the cia is out to destroy china avoid if at all possible
1.0,M,second only to walker in bad history profs scattered and unclear and his french accent makes it impossible to understand anything also screws up names and dates all the time i leave class more confused then when i go there he seems like a decent guy but nonetheless should be writing books not lecturing
3.0,M,i loved his classes they were interesting and despite what some people said he really knows his stuff the only complaint i have is that he assign any reading which made catching up with the book a little tough
1.5,M,very unclear lecturer he messes up the dates often and his lack of clarity makes it extremely hard to understand what he is lecturing about i recorded lectures and still had problems figuring out what he was talking about exam was easy he gives you of the final multiple choice quesions at the start of each class
3.0,M,wow how could you say he knows nothing about chinese history possibly the smartest prof i have ever had he does struggle at keeping his lectures clear but not his problem yours extremely smart and his tests and exam are easy
1.0,M,can barely speak english know anything about course material gives no page references to decode his impossible lectures he once said and i quote mandarins be lazy like mexicans who sleep under trees all day but not worth the agony and confusion avoid him at all costs
1.0,M,this class may seem easy at first but he makes it so much harder than it has to be he pauses all of the time and never gets to his point be the readings never correspond with class lectures
1.0,M,i hate him you get like grades per semester so if you up once over
3.0,M,nice guy smart guy but explain concepts well his class is deceptively difficult because it seems easy at first be ready to pull up pants and put your hard hat on because you will work he is a tough grader and if you got an a in his class like me you truthfully earned it
4.0,M,first day i was in class with mike he had sooo much energy i felt like i was in the mean just excited after that day he calmed down though mike is a very enthuastic instructor who loves what he does and helps his students a in preparing for labs and exams just keep him away from sugar i enjoyed his class
1.0,W,i just dont like her she acts like she is friendly but she is actually not she choose people to be nice to
5.0,W,she was very helpful and lenient when my group was getting our project done
3.0,M,at the beginning of the course he was a super nice guy funny then something rotten must have happened in his personal life cos half way through he became a miserable old coot
4.5,M,like the previous person said u never know what mood dwayne maybe in but he was still a very well knowledgable prof
1.0,M,dr salloway needs to retire asap he may have been great in the past but starting to slip he is always angry which seems to influence his he needs to take care of his issues before he comes in to class he tries to be funny and gets a few nervous chuckles but otherwise is not well liked at least this semester
1.0,M,what a harda i made an appointment to go in and discuss a paper topic and he blew me when i called him i had to leave voicemail messages because never around a total technophobe he also blamed the missed appointment on me saying he had written down the next week tho i programmed it into my calenda
4.0,M,totally awesome right about his lectures they get off topic you have to take whatever you want from his teachings
4.0,W,great prof she is a great lecturer involves the class and has lots of interesting movies the tests are easy if you do the reading directly out of the text book for the multiple choice and lecture notes for short answer her lecture notes are available in the library very good prof
2.0,W,she is very knowledgable in what she does i give her that she may be an amazing therapist but as an instuctor she is quite bad not flexible even re meeting unclear about assignments lectures too fast with too much stuff on overhead she teaches only part-time mainly a therapist
5.0,W,dr geller was so organized all mc questions were from text and short answers from lectures you know what to expect and can study accordingly know your stuff and do well i got an a in her class i actually looked forward to attending
5.0,W,make you work but she marks fair and communicates clearly in her lectures you do well if you slack off but if you are interested in the topic definitely learn
2.5,M,get a second opinion if you see him for course advice i know lots of students who had to come back for another year because he told them the wrong stuff good at teaching a p though
4.0,M,great guy expects a lot but works hard himself knows his stuff well i recommend
2.0,M,was interested before taking the course assignements were a joke he butchered the course material--what a waste of
4.0,M,this is the second course i with him i got an on the first course not saying its easy lots of reading and for assignments you have to use basically everything you know he is boring at time but its the materials fault get you through it an over all good proff
3.0,W,such an easy teacher all her tests quizzes are based off the notes in class she has some pretty ridiculous things to say though like if you eat a candy bar you should skip a meal get a good seat in class because her big hair blocks the overhead
5.0,M,he is tough but fair you cannot skip class because he does not allow any make-up for the unannounced quizzes one of the best professors at ccsn i recommend him but be ready to work
3.0,M,if you get lost during the class you can resort to writing bg quotes in your as good at geography or not everyone goes around saying an incritite or i am not sure of the catholic doctrine of what happend when the food and wine is digested he has a puzzling dislike for pentacostals though
3.0,M,ask questions he will ridicule you
3.0,M,attention deficit disorder describes brian sit still and talks a lot during exams which is very disruptive he knows history well and could answer most questions that were asked during exams he assigns people places to sit and seems to add tension to the situation
4.0,M,this is one of the best teachers around i had to chem classes before him and knew nothing now after having him for just one semester i know a take dr guy and will help u in any very funny chem humor
4.0,M,alan is a master of digressions and oozes passion for the art world he has a bias towards the extreme avant-garde so traditional artists may find the class a bit disheartening at first but the inspiration he imparts will drive you to push yourself in directions you expect a very knowledgeable fun prof
3.0,M,very good guy but unfortunately his teaching style caters primarily to students interested in pursuing very postmodern nontraditional artistic methods you hear the word technique thrown around too much in his class but otherwise be very supportive
4.0,M,at first he may seem a bit confusing but give him time he is truely one of the most caring and understanding individuals ever met one of best
5.0,M,allen has opened up my mind to the possibilities and talents i can explore within myself he allows you to give yourself permission to explore your own creative spirit and grow with it a huge influence on how i make art i am blessed to have known him and have nothing but gratitude for what he has taught me
5.0,M,i had him before i transfered to ou i miss his art classes and he loved everything i did very cool guy loves students who do more work than asked i got an a in every class i took of his
1.5,M,he was a horrible teacher you must avoid him if you can his exams are hard because they have tricky questions he comes off as a very approachable guy but beware gives you problems from the book to study yet none of them relates to the probs on the exams try to help you during the office hour but still help goes way too fast
5.0,M,i thought weiss was a great prof he explained exactly how to do the homework consistently day after day and is extremely helpful if you take the time to see him during office hours
5.0,M,i took calculus in high school and his class was great for more in depth understanding however i would not recommend his class for students who have never had calculus before just too many picky things to remember when just learning the basics for the first time
4.0,M,i think his teaching style is good you actually learn the stuff he teaches thats the good thing the bad thing is he sometimes goes really fast in class my suggestion is that if you had calc in high school take him keep up on your homework some of the test problems are right off the homework or review good professor overall
4.5,M,good for students who have had calc before if not see him during office hours do the maple labs right or they will screw you
4.0,M,had worse math teachers in the past i really understand all of the bad ratings here if you do your homework every day ask questions and do well on the tests you should be fine his tests particularly hard if you know what you are doing
5.0,M,it was precalc and that was easy but he is a great teacher lectures and notes are helpful tests are not difficult if you study your notes and the weekly wants everyone to do well but had no curve you have to earn your grade but it is not hared to do with old fashioned hard work and study
5.0,M,this professor is awesome love to take him for every math class i have to take at kettering his lectures are very clear and always willing to help
5.0,M,i loved his class i think prof shangraw is amazing very knowlegeable and concise tough grader but what do you expect its a tough field very helpful he knows his stuff plus a very nice guy with hot daughters
4.0,M,what a guy no suprises out of him at all help you out with anything just show up and be fine his quizes are nothing more than writing your name on a piece of paper we had tests the entire year which were a mid-term and a final if you pass this class do something good for yourself and change your major
5.0,M,well organized knows his stuff show up for call on time and hand in homework when it is due let his classroom personna fool you he really a nice guy who cares a lot for hthe student
1.0,M,no one can get a in his class he dosent change the materials over the years if u have all essays and exams u will get an a i dont like him personally
2.0,M,holy cow this is a law class not an army english class get a life man this man may be the biggest jerk on campus he is also a big fat liar
1.5,W,mean critical and makes fun of students i would not recommend this professor unclear instructions and unreasonable expectations i would never take a class from her again
1.0,W,i really hate this prof accent makes her unintelligible spends way too much time on stupid things as a result we are way behind in the course material
4.5,W,one of my favourite profs but an extremely hard marker once you get used to all the details she wants though you can pull off an a if you need someone to talk to you can always talk to her she is wonderful i kept taking her classes because i liked her not necessarily how hard i had to study
5.0,M,dude rocks his web site and down loads helped
2.5,M,good news not teaching at temple anymore took him for summer and reuctantly i survived the rumours are tru fu ckin crazy a prick makes u feel dumb if u ask or answer a question study ya a ss off go over the slides and make sure you read and find a copy of the solutions cuz wit this mad man a prayer aint gonna help
3.5,M,i was really scared to take his class after hearing all of the stories about him he really that bad the problems on the test come straight from the homework the multiple choice questions can kill you i sense any malice in him as others suggest i say the same for brennan
4.0,M,he really that bad if you do his work and study for his test you will get a good grade i took him for classes and i think he is a good teacher i actually learned in his classes
1.5,M,i do well in all accounting courses except his my time taking him shows no mercy and makes you feel stupid if you answer a question wrong in class
5.0,M,ok so the guy help that he is very attractive however he is a great teacher who makes sure you actualy learn the info not just memorize it for the impt if u want to be successful
5.0,M,clear interesting lectures the infamous study guides one page paper about anything you want welcomes comments and questions all around great prof and by the way he is not a dr he only has his brilliant
5.0,M,best teacher ever the one thing that sums his teaching style up is that you will remember everyrhing for years to come he is so effective that its sometimes creepy its all in his perfect communication skills love ya dale
1.0,W,horrible very disorganized all over the place i got an a but because i learned the whole book on my own i do not recommend her classes
4.5,W,amazing beautiful person so caring and passionate about her subject area more than fair tests interseting lectures and always willing to offer extra help super fun lady awesome classes
1.5,W,i took this calss with her and it was terrible i didnt know what she was even talking about because i was too busy taking her useless notes i admit i failed i toke it again with another prof and now i have a average
3.0,M,although paciocco is a leader in his field he does make the material more difficult to understand than need be his classes are incredibly stimulating but again he should keep things simple i found his final compared to the mid-term particularly difficult beware of this expect him to ask you to do a memo and essay for the final
4.5,M,pacioccco is god if you have him count yourself lucky his lectures are fascinating and always tempted to clap at the end of each lecture an excellent speaker although i wish sometimes he would allow us the opportunty to digest some of his ideas his exams and marking are fair
5.0,W,class is very clear if you pay attention to what she says and take notes class it will be a breeze tries to present real world examples of class material
5.0,W,wonderful professor makes a tough subject easy to understand wants you to know it and enjoy it not memorize things and puke them back on a test somewhat flighty but funny makes jokes about her husband that are funny since hes also a prof at ccc would take more classes if i graduating
5.0,M,i had several classes with scott in my years at au a great person and loves the subjects he teaches
5.0,M,he makes you do the work but he makes the class alot of fun
1.0,W,worst teacher ever does not know how to teach to the students degrades student and tell student they will make it towards their proffesion she knows a lot just dont know how to teach for anything serious power trip and her best friend is the the book shes terrible
1.0,W,this prof is not helpful at tells you to go back over your and read it you do not have a one word ans on your test you can not give her a will not accept it even if right
3.0,M,his lectures are all over the place but i love how he tells you a lot of gonna be on the exams good guy
2.5,M,too much to say in too little time almost half of what is said is over my head he is very smart but hard to follow i have a hard time sitting through class the more you know the higher your mark as it should be
2.0,M,very unorganized but very fair he is very helpful one on one but in a group he tends to be unclear
5.0,W,wonderful prof i plan to continue on with spanish after i fulfilled my requirements but she inspired me to do that very helpful and is always helping plan very cool activities
5.0,W,very knowledgable i learned more from her in one semester than i learned in a couple of years in high school
1.5,M,this guy is so into himself and thinks hes tough stuff if you dont get involved and go on remotes you are not liked favorites are clear in his classes
5.0,M,people make peter bloom sound like the most inhumane pompous person ever to inhabit the planet but really an excellent professor i have learned more from his classes than any other classes taken here even his tangents are informative take his seminars worth it
3.5,M,while much more cantankerous and demanding than most professors professor bloom retains an incredible degree of integrity it took me a good seventy percent of the semester to warm up to him but venerable and somewhat-scary character that he is i hold him in the highest esteem
2.0,M,prof bloom is a brilliant but arrogant man that will not hesitate to make fun of anyone in order to make himself look better be careful as you can learn a lot from his classes but can get a lot of grief from them as a result of his perfectionism and high handed manner as well
5.0,W,great class radhika is fantastic she has great energy and is brilliant but not condescending
1.0,W,oh god she is aweful and biased ever take her class unless its the last class on earth and you have no other choice even then it would be better without her class
2.5,M,loved him in hu but his modern lit class was the worst nightmare of my senior year he was unclear in giving paper topics then would complain later and make you rewrite the it was so frustrating
2.0,M,dr hadley is a teacher of the past students can learn a lot from him if they overlook his nastiness which occurs a lot he expects a lot from you and he wants you to expect more from yourself he is also getting older so that is why he sometimes seems forgetful overall a wonderful and funny man who has an incredible amount of knowledge to offer
3.5,M,hadley could be harsh but you just have to take it in stride an old man who knows by now that not everyone is going to like him so he try to be the favorite professor you have to be a drama major to make him like you you just have t
5.0,M,i think dr hadley is an amazing person and an amazing professor i was neither a theater major nor did i make him food and he liked me i found in my experiences that the students who disliked him really were the idiots after my undergrad and degree i have yet to know another professor with such balanced knowledge and experience
4.0,M,dr hadley can be an aquired taste a lot of what he says he mean all you have to do to get decent grades in his class is do do your homework and participate and right though as a generation we know a lot about technology but not a lot about world affairs
2.0,M,a really nice guy but the class is often unclear of his expectations and you love suspense and want to be left guessing the whole semester he is your guy
1.0,M,dr garner has a god complex i took him when it was still and he told us this class is too easy to be upper-level i went to see him during office hours to discuss homework i complete his advice do the homework
3.0,M,seems to have a hard time explaining physics although he tries hard i did think the tests were pretty fair though i studied little and pulled off an a
1.0,W,i hated the course and the way the professor interacted with the students i think she needs some people skills
5.0,W,i adore ms nodine you earn whatever grade you get in her class and if you are really trying you will be proud of what you create w her she is always willing to help be afraid to ask i know she can seem a little intimidating at times but look past that to one of the best professors and artist in the state
5.0,M,this was one of his first classes to teach and you could tell he interested in it still very nice guy very helpful and always remembers students has a really funny sense of humour too got an a in the class without a whole lot of work
4.5,W,wow amazing lecturer but horribly hard marker she seems receptive to new and different ideas but even when a student has support to back up their claims if it the same as hers you will do badly be careful when taking one of her prepped for a lot of work and not so great of mark in the end
4.0,W,a good teacher willing to help she is crazy when it comes to marking i think she forgot it was a frist year class marked way too hard would be great for a or year class
3.5,W,tip write down everything she says except for those topics that she repeats over and over just put a star beside it i know its a little geeky but you probably should reread your notes and rewrite them to fully understand hard marker be sucessful if you agree wuth her
1.0,W,horrible annoying to listen to and picks favorites very hard to get a good mark in her tests even if u have asked her for help and she does still do recommended
4.5,W,last class she said sure times emphasizes words to the point where you even stand to listen to her talk emphasizes soo annoying
1.0,W,evil woman only gives you an a if you pretend you agree with her agenda
5.0,W,if you do the work get an a her class discussions were pretty depressing and it was sometimes hard to know what she wanted in an assignment but overall it was an enjoyable class
5.0,W,prof m worked with me in and i enjoyed her approach to the above noted class

4.5,M,a lot of bashing here bet not from anyone who has practiced prof frey does a terrific job of preparing his students to practice law which is what the majority of his class is there for his contract theory served me well on the bar exam and in the eight years since tough yes but excellent
1.0,M,i am now stupider for having taken this class i imagine why schools keep hiring him learn everything yourself but make sure to learn it his way impossible exam hours closed book essay questions about a million issues i would fake an allergy to oklahomans and transfer out asap
1.0,W,the most unfreiendly unhelpful person i have encountered why this women still maintains her employment is beyond me
1.0,W,very defensive personality she wants her students to have her opinion not their own
1.0,W,mastered basice grammar and spelling herself unbelievable that she was hired unfair grading and very defensive personality avoid this professor
1.5,W,if you write the same way she would expect a good grade just because you say something differently make what i said wrong she needs to realize she make the rules of english and their are other ways than her way
5.0,M,dr sambrook is awesome you have to take the time to build a relationship with him he is shy talk to him and he will talk back i went the whole summer with him to ecuador and had an absolute blast with him he wrote me the most touching letter of reference so i could become a teacher if you are bored you are boring
4.5,M,such a nice guy his tests were a bit hard though alot of the things on the test he did not cover in class so read the book
3.5,M,so boring i had a hard time actually listening but it was a pretty simple class i took at itv so if i didnt get to take the test on blackboard i would have been ruined because the test are hard he uses every detail of his lecture in the book or not
1.0,W,o stand her as a teacher she makes the stupidest corrections on papers when nothing needs to be corrected and if you dont agree with her your grade is screwed her husband is better than her
1.0,W,terribly into her own ideas not interested in helping students who want to agree with her every thought
1.5,W,she taught me to be a worse writer her comments were most unhelpful and her attitude in the classroom is condescending and self-important try to disagree with her it do any good if you can avoid her do it for your own good take spaulding instead
5.0,W,she is a great professor i loved her class and thought that she did a great job teaching it
5.0,M,claflan is the best by far he is a great teacher and he knows his stuff although he gives you a lot of homework it is well worth it

4.5,M,great professor comprehensive fun and never gave an assignment that necessary although i mean does kinda have a troll-like quality to he
5.0,M,so cool whenever i feel like giving up he inspires me to keep going
4.5,M,chris is the mother freaking best especially when he lets you make a storyboard that includes menuedo and haggis and sloths

5.0,M,consider yourself lucky if you have the priviledge of being in prof class it is rare to encounter a teacher who so genuinely cares for and believes in his students certainly more than just an entrepreneurship course prof eloquent lectures inspire you to do better
5.0,M,there are few teachers that trully make a difference in students lives prof lank is one of them he cares about his students has confidence in us he sees us as the future and believes we can all make a difference in the world his course is interesting provides great notes and great guest sp

3.5,M,flaming but its a good thing i think super confusing as you have at least different cases going on at all times strick has surprise pop quizzes and doesnt explain things well he thinks everyone who takes this bio is going to be a bio major or pre-med so he trys to sort the best out
5.0,M,this man is amazing sheer wisdom love at first all i have to say i wish i could take chinese for the rest of my life he tells the absolutely best jokes

3.0,M,good class good prof my only complaint is that if you give him exactly what he said in his own words you get full credit for it he also given anyone in this class more than a on a paper yet
4.5,M,very good and amusing professor his classes are always of a very relaxed nature if you like his sense of humor the first day of class probably hate the course
4.5,M,professor lian is a treasure a man of singular kindness and humor--not to mention staggering amounts of learning i took his philosophical taoism class through a course-sharing program with kenyon college and even over a tv uplink he was fantastic i would kill to protect this man

2.5,W,her projects are very time consuming and she gives a midterm and final paper this is an art class for sake just because she was once an english major mean we need to suffer take her class if yiu want a pain up your ass
5.0,W,had her for a few classes and a few portfolio reviews no no frills and will tell you straight up good and crap i think my favourite professor in the department thus far
5.0,W,she is kind and understanding and helps you to nuture your skills she is pretty cool so if you have any problems just talk to her and if you put in th effort you will get a good grade
1.5,W,this teacher base her grading not on what u do in class but how much u kiss her but and since i kiss her but she gave me a f i did pass my test and speeches and still understand how i got a f stay away from this teacher if u have to take comm at another campus worth it
4.0,W,she is full of energy and the class is quite easy but she is picky when it comes to speeches if you are not an a kisser than you need to be sure that your paper is a plus material because if you suck up and you know that you did at least a b she will give you a b or a c
5.0,W,a very happy and thoughful teacher if you take her class she will make learning about communications interesting work with you to help you pass her class and a great person to talk to inside and out her class i will still keep in touch with her after her class
5.0,W,is full of energy every always has a smile and she will help you as much as she can all you have to do is ask i like her and i enjoyed her class
5.0,W,be stiff during the speeches bang on the table and get your point accross as if you are having a conversation with your friends but be proper the only way you will get an a in her class be stiff and boring and have some flavor and creativing writing in your speeches
1.0,M,worst teacher ever you cannot understand him unless you speak japanese and he is very mean
4.0,M,brilliant and charismatic his passion is contagious and he really cares about the subject his students and the world great teacher
5.0,W,if you actually read the material and make the connections between the theoretical and the primary texts golden prof rohy makes every effort to help in this process she answers emails always and is more than not in her office very very dedicated also very smart perhaps the most misunderstood professor at uvm
2.5,W,she spent time on books she have her grading system is very questionable and her class is not very interesting
3.0,W,ugh this class was so boring she good at stimulating interesting discussions and practically has to pry reactions out of students the book choices are not great either she is nice and helpful but the class is unbearably boring
5.0,M,david huddle is the best teacher at uvm he is indeed the greatest
5.0,W,i like her a lot very helpful

5.0,M,good professor no doubt that he really knows chemistry he is however fast paced and loves to hear himself talk participation in his class is not very encouraged and he enjoys humiliating students he refers to himself as which is a little disturbing to say the least yet he remains the best chemistry professor at nsu in my opinion
3.5,M,online class contact with him sort of fizzeled throughout the semester basically he never answered his e-mails easy class only asked for quizzes essays and discussion postings no final
5.0,M,great teacher explains as much as he helps a lot he knows his stuff and doesnt refer to his notes every two sec like sense of humor always there to help you make chem worth siting through for chem i revolved my schedule aorund this mans been with him semesters and have great chem grades till now
1.0,M,the i teach i profess bullcorn has been played out on me before i took this class it is an utter waste of time and space i pay his dang salary so i expect to be taught something i learned more psychology from watching evangelion than from his class
1.0,M,awful teacher do not take him nice guy but a bad teacher his lecture has nothing to do with the tests and neither do the readings on most tests the highest grade is a c his tests come from random topics that students have never heard of my favorite is when he said he was a professor so he is not hear to teach
5.0,W,took her for the summer a great class and i learned a lot
2.0,M,he tells you one thing asks you to do it and then totally changes his mind he isnt helpful in the least im not a fan of him
3.5,M,i believe he does not have a hot pepper cuz this instructor is hot stuff he can teach too fun class and funny guy
5.0,M,excellent teacher very fun and knowledgeable about course material and give extremely fair tests for the midterm and final i really cant say anything bad about him as a professor if you get a chance to take classes with him you wont regret it

4.0,W,very sweet lady genuinely concerned about her students highly recommed
4.0,W,i had her back in in night school definetely a people person emphasized humanitarian qualities and interpersonal skills she is a professional counsellor and it shows strong feedback does not simply mark right or wrong carefully reads answer and your understanding of concepts but a few students did not take to her approach
5.0,M,he is a great prof he knows what he is doing his beard is also very hot and his silver hair makes him distinguished
4.0,M,hard class for the graduate students even more torturous for the undergraduates horrible book both book and gao expected a lot of prior knowledge but very helpful as long as you ask go to his office or ask him quetsions in class good luck
4.5,M,good class he goes through material quickly but if you go to class everyday and pay attention so fine computer labs are not that big of a deal since all the programs are already written
3.5,M,very very hard to understand due to his accent so if you arent a math wiz it will be very hard for you to learn and pass the class
3.0,M,hard to understand but math and he writes it on the baord so ok teaches the subject well and kinda goofy so it makes class interesting good teacher overall
5.0,M,ensemble rocked he gave us music that was a challenge and really pushed us musically jazz history is a cake walk if you only hold a minor interest amazing musician for a stiff morman doc is awesome
4.0,M,this guy is something he will make you either laugh or cry the map exam is easy the other i guess too cause if you read book and notes be fine just know the stuff he assigned for the particular day
4.5,M,a really great teacher actually very interesting for such a potentially boring topic but his tests are murderous and a tough marker highest grade was a b on the midterm and in the end the curve was not so great also very understanding with proofread papers before grading and give a chance to do better only problem is tests
4.5,M,just finished his class it was difficult but very interesting his personality is fantastic he seems to love what he is doing
3.5,M,if you pay attention and take notes anyone can pass it if you have hard time paying attention and need to be guided every step of the way then take somebody of the work is on your own but he will help out
4.5,M,i had a very good time in his class the discussions were great he has a fantastic and sharp sense of humor the tests and the final easy if you pay attention
2.0,M,hes a nice guy but boring as all hell he put me to sleep each day the semester lectures which is boring doesnt have a good method of recommend him to anyone unless you can read comprehend the info on your own pass
4.0,M,he seems a little unfriendly during class but when you speak to him after class a great guy and very understanding if you work hard and participate in class it is easy to do well his tests are straightfoward and he gives you a review sheet i wish all prof were like him
4.5,M,he is a very good professor look if you got problems like i did just speak to him after class explain the issue participate in class discussions do your job and you will have a good great but work hard
4.0,M,easy prof agree with previous posts that he tends to ramblre and is a bit unorganized but overall pretty easy and gives good grades and he gives a review sheet for final and test also lets you hand in paper early to discuss with him nice and laid back easy to do well and get an a
3.5,M,pretty nice guy very opinionated but he hears out everyone and is pretty reasonable knows his stuff and the class discussions are pretty good if you know the material do fine
5.0,M,he knows the material very well and adds many interesting details you will enjoy his class
5.0,W,i love carol she made me laugh she tells you exactly what she wants from yuo in papers and really all she wants very straight forward about grading
5.0,W,excellent teacher tries to scare you in the let her do it-stick it out and it is not as tough as you think just do the work-which is not that tough and you will get an a
3.5,W,wonderful an easy grader if you give her what she wants as long as you follow the assignment be fine obvious to see that she knows what talking about and her enthusiasm comes through her lectures i would definatly take her class over again
2.5,W,has her favorites her lectures are excellent she can be a bit condescending
4.5,W,going in for office hours is very helpful she is a very friendly professor and enthusiastic about biology in depth analysis of the chemistry involved in biology occassional extra credit pop quizzes highly recommended
4.0,M,i was never open to non-western lit but his enthusiasm and knowledge of the subject made me want to learn more and i enjoyed it
5.0,M,if you think that he is egotistical or hard you should drop out now you have no hope of coming up with an original concept on your own and saying that he doesnt let you have your own opinions is catagorically incorrect that is exactly what he tries
5.0,M,would almost go back to school to take a class of his again best there is
5.0,M,fitz is a cool guy we called him wolfman jack because of that hoary mane of his those who think he is egotistical or has some crazy agenda are morons his only interest is in furthering the abilities of his students he was one of the most memorable knowledgable and interesting professors i have ever had the priviledge of studying under
2.0,M,an automaton that spits out postmodern buzzwords with enthusiasm he will relate to you his experience chatting with derrida whom along with foucault seem to be his intellectual idols nice guy but the intellectual atmosphere trapped in will make any class a terrible experience
1.0,M,i was pretty interested in this class before i took it but this one spoiled it all for me he is very egotistical has his own agenda and will stick to it and will not let you explore your own ideas avoid him if you can you will regret taking this class it is helpful in no way at all a waste
3.0,M,overall he was energetic and interesting to listen to even though many of his theories are far-fetched pertaining to the course his lectures dont really do much for you because the tests are essays over your opinions over themes in books
3.0,W,boring books boring class not enough student involvement she talks for majority of class difficult quizes and expects a bit much avoid
3.0,W,i took the online course so i know what like in person but as far as i got to know her i can say that she was willing to help and made the course requirements quite clear she was really tough on marks overall say ok
4.5,W,yen lu is wise and keeps on track praise comes at unexpected times analysis of subject is very insightfull she seems a bit sad or at least she is wearing a mask the core person is a caring wonderful teacher stirs the pot gets the most out of students who respond and show up
4.5,W,really nice and pretty approachable her husband passed away during the semester so she took a month leave so the class slowed down and we really learn anything however i felt that i bonded w the students in the class which is what muse wants you to do nice very helpful
5.0,M,he illuminated modern philosophy taught me how to teach myself makes school fun and challenging for all levels of intelligence and aptitude simultaneously and soes all of this with a kind of stoner demeanor that makes him all the more approachable everyone can and should take from paul
5.0,M,he is a great teacher and probably the only good philosophy professor we have another surprising thing is that he makes the final paper fun anyone at all interested in philosophy should take a course with him
5.0,M,best professor at wc some of these reviews have been written by morons clouded by ideology exactly what pk avoids best and his calm collected manner opens your mind to a world of thought beyond what you can prepare for so brilliant that he illuminated hegel one of the worst writers of all time with absolute clarity reading is intense but not overly demanding very good about assigning only sections that were essential take paul k especially cent phil even if your only ph class
4.0,M,he is one of the most amazing people ever
3.0,W,this professor is in her year and treats her students as graders but she helps with your test grades no need to take notes because the test info is not from her notes just the book she will be a good teacher one day
1.0,W,this professor is extremely difficult the material is not covered well all i can say to anyone who takes her is good luck to you
1.0,W,whatever you do take her class there are no tests to even see if your understanding the material just homework and the occasional quiz which are just like the of grade and final exam of grade going to have to drop her class and never gotten below a b in a class
3.5,W,dr hirsch is a busy professor she gives lots of homework but read study its possible get an a in her class do all the hmwk keep track of all your grades do not miss class she comes off as mean or snippy but a nice lady if u want an a in her class work for it pay attn study guides read all chapters extra credit oppty
1.0,W,never take her class that is too much work not much she absents a lot you will not learn skips her class a lot the class start as people now there are only around left it is a waste of time trust me
1.0,W,the materials is hard no matter what but the way she teaches and the material she gave out during class is horrible not much help during lab avoid
1.0,W,this was the worst teacher i ever had people would sleep during her lecture i recommend to not take this teacher cause a lot of people would fail
5.0,M,very nice guy pretty funny as well great to talk to about grad schools and the like if what you need yes he makes you memorize the amino acids but get over it the class is interesting and still say more conceptually based than memorization based especially compared to evil bios tests are challenging but it was nice to actually be challenged on a test and get a chance to show what i learned
3.0,M,a nice guy and pretty good at lecturing tests are too hard for the material he presents visit him in the office take his class
1.0,W,dr frank seemed like she liked i disagreed with her then she made my life hell even when i tried to do what she wanted i was marked and there was no way out avoid avoid avoid
4.5,W,dean frank is one of the nicest people i have ever met in my life she takes her students very seriously and will take the time to listen she will do anything to help her students she is very sweet and knows how to make anyone feel better she is one of the best faculty members at kennesaw state
4.0,M,just stand up to him guys the reasons why he makes us do everything very thoroughly is because when you get into the real world how its gotta be thank him later
3.5,M,he helps out when you ask for it in the first semester you just need to stand up to him when he criticizes you and respect you make sure to put units on everything
5.0,M,he can be a bit intimidating but i find once you take the time and show him that you are actually making his time worth the effort he will treat you fine he want to waste his time with students who do anything in the class chem easy he knows it and proves it everyday
5.0,W,incredible woman with such a large heart and lots of stories i loved talking to her and miss presence here a lot she really helps you understand the texts with all of her background information and makes lectures interesting hopefully be back in spring
1.5,W,i was very intrested in the class but because of very poor communication became fastly frustrated online classes need to have a strong backbone for the support of the students which she doesnt have
1.0,W,i took this class online she never told you how you are doing or if you were doing anything correctly she is very unorganized and always has an excuse for everything take her class
5.0,M,professor pratt is great one of those teachers who you can just feel enjoy teaching you never feel intimidated to ask a question and he never gives you attitude for asking questions in person as opposed to in front of the class
5.0,M,michael pratt is probably an ideal professor clearly intelligent and engaged and he makes a potentially boring subject contracts interesting plus warm and generous to his students one of the best professors had in my many years of being a student
5.0,M,dr critelli is the best professor ever had lectures were fun to attend and you leave class feeling that actually learned something i wish he taught more than just phil because i would take another one of his classes even though it has nothing to do with my major
5.0,M,i would take his class a hundred times the most hilarious man i have ever known if it came down to hanging out with friends or going to class i would not hesitate to cancel plans with friends
4.0,M,critelli is hilarious his lectures are confusing but because of the subject matter not him he wants everyone to get an a and does his best to clarify the material no matter how many times you need him to go over it take this class
5.0,M,best mis professor hands down cares about his students and is always approachable tests are long and comprehensive but the curve is insane so sweat it genuinely seems interested in the course material very passionate about computing and he uses a mac so i will give him points just for that fact
4.5,M,tim hill rocks his teaching method was a bit unconventional this semester he made us the students teach ourselves his tests are pretty hard but he curves the midterm and final so sweat it the best advice i can give is attend class and make sure to participate in webct
5.0,M,dr hill is one of the best and most passionate mis teachers all the people who like him should honestly consider changing their major he expects that you read the book which is short and good his tests are very tricky cuz u have to link concepts but he does hook it up with a nice curve he cares a lot about students and teaching
1.5,W,ok so this class was boring and too easy but the teacher complicated it she takes everything from the book even explanations which arent really worth while because they might not make sense to you so get yourself a real good tutor for this class
5.0,M,one thing to remember in his class is that its an easy a all you have to do is write down whatever he writes what he writes is on the quiz if one wants to make an easy c just pay attention on the day of a quiz when he goes over the chapter make sure people ask questions test more questions means more answers
5.0,M,my favorite teacher ever i love him
2.0,M,this class was about using the internet to learn about structures sequences etc to begin with book it made a fun subject boring sat in front of a computer and never used it he lectured all hours straight suppose to be learning how to use the internet for this stuff continued in next comment
2.0,M,but he is lecturing on molecular bio and biochem stuff he is asking us all mo bio and biochem questions even though the prereq for this class is only genetics the final was looking up protein info online but he never taught us that which is the main thing we had to teach it to ourselves if you ask for help he just confuses you more
3.0,M,he is a nice character and he provides the questions before the tests and also gives oportunities for group solving of his assignments because the course itself is a very hard one one of the hardest taken
4.0,W,ehs was a hard class but she made it easier to understand her only downfall is that her voice can get boring during lectures
3.5,W,professor eng knows the subject matter quite only complaint i have is how she arrives at the final doesnt reflect what students do throughout the semester
3.0,M,great guy gives you an a if you study exams and gives you the answers to the test the week before take him
2.5,M,great guy very helpful and gives you the answers to both exams in the class prior to the exam not need to read the book i read the whole thing and it was not worth it take him
5.0,M,loved his class has a great sarcastic sense of humor and tells interesting stories people are just scared to actually study in college
1.5,M,im so glad he is leaving
1.5,M,this professor was annoying he talks down to students and teaches with a bias i hated this class i learned nothing but his views
1.0,M,sure he knows what talking about but no one else does and if you write papers you want to basically say what he said because no one view is correct to him the expert can you tell i really like the class
1.0,M,what in the name of god was he talking about i sat in his class for an entire semester and had no idea what he was talking about each and every day
3.5,M,very knowledgable in class but his exams are killer only gives a study guide for midterm or final not both keep good notes but also do the reading on time be warned he does not do extra credit if your grade goes down after an exam also he has very little actual graded material so do good on all of them or else
5.0,M,there is something kind of tough about his physical appearance my friend once said that guy eats glass for breakfast i think true but at least funny i liked his intro to greek class unbelievably patient with beginners
5.0,M,great prof can get a little dry in lecture sometimes but it makes his random unexpected humor all the funnier when it comes
5.0,M,pretty sure i took every class this man taught a great professor and a very nice man he will answer any question you think to ask and definitely go to greece with him it was one of the best experiences of my life love from a member of the animal group
4.0,M,great professor take you a couple weeks before you stop finding his voice funny
5.0,M,he tells great stories and his classes are easy just takes detailed notes and ace the tests
5.0,M,assigns homework questions for each chapter offers extra credit on exams gives study guides trips to the planetarium a good professor very smart sticks relatively close to the book but he may expound be lazy in the class and do fine grading scale is averaged based on past class performances
5.0,M,amazing teacher probably my favorite he is so good at music and philosophy and man he is hot
5.0,M,i am honored to have been in his class i wish him luck in his retirement but i wish he leave he has so much knowledge to talented musician
5.0,M,talented at not only explaining what he means clearly but also at understanding what student are actually saying i had him for my senior essay advisor and he was extremely helpful he focuses on getting as much as possible out of any conversation without making you feel inadequate while still encouraging you to learn and challenging you
5.0,M,an invigorating tutor and all the girls follow him around like he is a peice of candy
5.0,M,awesome teacher definately knows what he is talking about and has some interesting stories to tell
5.0,M,very fun teacher while teaching the math he relates the stuff to interesting subjects he is very intellegent and almost seems overqualified very easy to work with
3.5,M,very nice guy and really cared about his students he has some really great stories
3.0,M,very confusing at times i would have no idea what he was talking about he likes to jump around a lot tends to forget things a lot stuff like oh yeah you need to know this to do this problem but i forgot to teach it to you is a very interesting person though and has some funny stories
3.0,W,shaw only receives good ratings because mostly everyone taking her are arth majors themselves with a real passion for the subject quality of professor be damned as someone who is not an arth major i can assuredly tell you that impossible an unreasonable grader with the essays and midterm i take her unless you have to
4.0,W,great class great professor her lectures are interesting and not too much work is required in the class just study for test
4.0,M,professor raj is an all around good professor he is clear and you will understand the material his tests are not easy but they are not overly difficult if you pay attention i would recommend him for dbc
5.0,M,tough professor asks a lot of you he really cares how you do in his courses willing to help out a struggling student
5.0,M,one of thee best teachers if you are a slacker ha you are ed you will be taking the class agian take the time to humble yourself and go to his office hours if you need to he is one smart teacher
2.0,W,she is a very nice lady and i understood her notes her quizes were easy but her tests left many people in the class with ots of questions i felt the tests were too hard and might bring down someones grade a lot
4.5,W,boyd is a very sweet lady and makes learning interesting i thought dance appreciation was going to be so boring but not with her
5.0,W,emily is one of the most energetic and outgoing professors i ever had there never was a day i want to not come to class i loved every minute of it she truly is a blessing and a gifted teacher
5.0,W,emily is awesome she is such a sweetie definitely an understanding teacher especially compared to the evil witches darby and tiffanee if you want to have fun then take emily
1.0,W,she is not a good teacher at all and has a bad attitude
1.0,W,i have hated english all my life then my senior year i got a good teacher and liked it for a year now i have had allameh and i hate the damn class she was no help to me whatsoever i hate the class and i espically will never take a class from her again eng is crap and you have to take it fine just whatever you do take dr allameh
1.0,W,she is a horrible teacher never take this class i done well before her and she was no help with writing papers
3.5,M,a really nice guy the whole class sleeps and he makes really corney jokes but a easy a the test are easy and the final paper is only two pages and he is very generous with giving out i recommend this class
5.0,M,farmen is one of the best professors at this university he pushed the envelope for our class and got us to really delve deep into our thoughts and gain so very much from his class it was a great life experience and i would recommend him more than any other prof also since his class is mainly discussion little real homework either
1.0,M,i absolutly hated the class he was horrible i believe that he can teach at all
4.5,M,hes nuts and crazy but great he is so smart
5.0,M,genius he was the reason i switched my major because he said it challenging me in any way now i love what im doing thanks dr farmen
4.0,M,very good teacher hilarious the first day of class with him i was sure he was he just naturally that way he knows ridiculous amounts of psychology he also understands that taking physical notes is dumb like points right there
5.0,M,dr farmen challenges your preconceptions makes you question your opinion then helps you articulate what you really mean he is great at teaching lectures and at directing discussion courses
4.5,M,tests very hard failed everything except made a c on final and somehow managed to make a c in class if you are having a hard time go talk to him about it act interested in his class and if you are a girl act interested in him and he will pass you dress cute and flirt but class is pretty hard
5.0,M,he was a very good teacher i enjoyed his class quite a bit he has many interesting stories to tell he knows his stuff watch out for pop quizes in this class
5.0,M,this was someone that i actually rightfully trusted to discuss my future in pharmacy i had him for transfer seminar and found him to be one of the brightest informative and moral people a classmate that had him for drugs and behavior said the guy is fascinating i look forward to his class i want all the prep i can get before drug lit
1.0,W,she is the worst teacher on the earth she will make you hate school for the rest of your life she gives on hate her so much i took my essay to the writing center and instrudtors told me my essay was good but she gave me a d how horrible you can get avoid her
5.0,W,great teacher she may seem a little intimidating at first but she is fun and laid back i was deathly terrified of oral presentations but she made it fun if you are afraid of public speaking take this teacher you regret it oh and rumors are true she does let you out early
3.0,W,at first she seems like she is going to be easy and lax but as the semester rolls she gets harder and harder she expects everyone to be english scholars and on my first essay she gave me an f and i take my time on my essays if you think getting on her good side will help you it
2.0,W,the worst teacher ever way too hard to get a c so imagine an a unless you are an english instructor you can get an a i did not enjoy her class at all instead of teaching she talks about her family
2.5,W,i thought she does not like minorities i did not enjoy her class at all she is hard on grading
5.0,W,she is very helpful and her class was the first english class i enjoyed before her i avoided it like the plague now i wish she taught more classes
2.5,M,schneider is a poor educator but he does seem to know the material he changed the weighting of assignments several times throughout the semester which was annoying the class project was far too large in scope and felt more like slave labor since it took hundreds of hours to complete yes really
1.5,W,not a big fan sarah she teaches nothing in class i spent hours with the study guide and found i had wasted my time when i took the exam
2.0,W,really vague and very flaky however keep this woman in mind when needing recommendations or someone with a degree to back your opinion she rocks in that way in all one of those really accomplished people who has trouble communicating with her classes
1.0,W,she is a terrible teacher she picks favorites and marks you according if she likes you or not she has no idea on what she is teaching she needs to learn more about children before she teaches others
1.0,M,sun needs a translator to teach in the us he should take esl himself before teaching others i can still vaguely remember his incessant mumbling that maybe only he thought was actual language being spoken impossible to understand he could have been speaking amazonian or latin for all we know
5.0,M,awesome teacher only wish he didnt have to leave for all miss his teaching def understanding and polite and everything you could ask for of a teacher
4.0,M,fox is awesome the subject matter can be dull at times but he really knows his stuff and tries his best to make it interesting which helps when it comes to paying attention he is a fair grader and give any busy work take a class with him
3.5,M,i really enjoyed the disscussions in this i could stay awake great guy but dry wit is a good description he has an unobtrusive monotone voice so super easy to zone out during lectures panic if you get to al
4.5,M,i love the class he is very helpful and sending emails for each reading keeps me on my toes with the assignments studied for are very easy
4.5,M,he has an extremely dry wit so if you do then find him really interesting and funny if you probably be bored to tears but his courses are pretty easy usually take home exams or essays if you go to class and do your work nominally well you should get at least a b
5.0,W,such a great your not good in math do her extra credit it helps
5.0,W,i really loved this class it was a lot of fun and dr cawthorne is so sweet she makes things clear and very easy to understand even if you the best math student if for some reason you understand she will do anything she can to help you
2.0,M,this professor does a very good job of writing examples on the that hes always standing in front of them and writes them at lightning speed be warned professor gives no theory or background on subject he never shows up to the lab but can be found durring office hours this was the most infuriating class that i ever took
4.0,M,dennis is a wonderful professor you agree i love how he sets up his methods classes for open discussion and felt that it as a good way of understanding the concepts as well as his and my peers views and in turn made me think about mhow i would use those concepts in my own teaching i too also like mastery learning making sure the concepts are learned correctly like in conducting that is a vital skill for all teachers and is best that it can be done over until it is done right hard and short
4.0,M,dennis rules and in love with me probably the most laid back teacher that actually gets kids to work and do a good job how he does it is a mystery
3.0,M,hes pretty cool hes classes are ok he goes on tangents but hes a nice guy and you can pretty much do nothing in his classes
3.0,M,watch out for those short shorts of his
5.0,M,dennis is the best a wonderful teacher and he truly cares about his students he is always there when you need someone to talk to cry to or get advice st rose is lucky to have him
5.0,M,dennis is dennis very helpful and always there to talk if you are having a bad day all around hes a very caring professor and wants his students to succeed
4.5,M,awesome i love jazz and he just makes it alot of fun especially whne he plays hte sax
5.0,M,this guy is easy if you take him you will get an a there are two book additional reading tests that you will get a on and the other regular tests are questions multiple choice there is a lot of note taking so bring a recorder
4.5,M,go ahead and take this you do is take notes so you better be there he talks fast but the tests are pretty easy
4.5,M,his class was long as you go to class and take notes and are alive in class you can make an a in the tests are easy as long as you look over your are easy too he tells you them before the book tests are easy too as long as you read the book
5.0,M,easiest class ever you take a lot of notes from the minute he walks in the door till class is over but thats all you need to pass his class even need the text book if you go to class you have it made lecture test and bokk test are easy easy easy
1.0,M,the class was uninteresting he was frequently incorrect and i so much care for his humor
1.0,M,is not clear as to what he says know the topic without his notes which are frequently incorrect
1.0,M,dennis is a nice person deep down but has no place teaching at desales his productions are not art they are movies on stage he has a horrible work ethic and does not know what professional theatre is like today he can talk all about how things were hu
4.0,M,knows his stuff when it comes to history of the theatre also very thorough in teaching directors what to consider when taking on a play
3.0,M,deep down i know that dennis is a good guy just a little misguided his classes were boring though you really need to pay attention to pass though runner up years strong yessssssssssssss
1.5,M,i like him as a friend but as a director teacher he sucks ass and has no tact but he is a sweet man who thinks of his students as his children when not directing them the yellow jacket is mine
5.0,W,one of the most dynamic personalities ever encountered she makes a very dry subject entertaining and i learned a lot from her if they offer her tenure brandeis will lose a real gem
2.5,W,i sleep well before her class she likes to make you feel stupid
4.0,M,i hated him for dictation but then we got along in theory i would always make comments just to rile him up and now i love him hahah hes just funny and a really smart guy
5.0,M,i find roter strangely sexy and i know why maybe i am attracted to his intelligence
4.5,M,dr roter is extremely intelligent and has an intense grasp of the musical world backed up with a great passion for music he also has a good sense of humor although nerdy at times and sets a high standard that encouraged me to do my best very interesting classes
4.5,W,possibly the hardest classes but lewis is so good worth putting in the extra time and work be prepared for the bar if you take her class
3.5,M,a great teacher his assignments build on each other so make sure you understand as you go and start the assignments the day assigned my first c was in his class and i changed my major to business but good for computer science majors if you want an easy course
4.5,M,on of the greatest professor in this department i enrolled in every class he taught because it is a guarantee that you will learn he does give a lot of work and all his classes are a challenge
4.0,M,dr rimes is the best lecturer in the department a good guy to talk to during office hours as well the only concerns i have with him as a teacher is that sometimes his assignments are unclear and he seems a little disorganized with his paperwork your hw and tests
4.0,M,i liked him thought he was an excellent teacher at first i found him slightly unapproachable but after i had to go to him for help he was great and helped me out just get behind in class
2.5,M,what the heck was the point in me taking it he is boring and the material was pointless
1.0,M,i found him to be both uninterested in his students and in the subject matter he spent the entire semester reiterating the same exact communications theories every other com class at emu teaches with nothing new or even remotely insightful to add doc robinson on the dangers of dogmatic thinking intolerance and ethnocentrism yet i have found him to be one of the most dogmatic preachy intolerant and close-minded professors i have ever had
4.5,M,omg his classes are so not hard just do the reading people and take notes then memorize his defs the pts of certain concepts etc he like slacker students so take him if you give a
4.0,M,at first i thought he would be hard and he seemed hard to understand as class progressed though its very easy to understand what he wants he wants for his students to express what they are reading and learning from his long as you appear to be mindful of others you will have no problem
5.0,W,loved her as a clinical instructor classroom was wonderful she made everything interesting and soooooo clear
2.0,W,she is not a is a propaganda a manipulator liberals and will love and should drop her class good she is not a your tution money is being wasted she should be forcibly removed from the school this is a jesuit institution not college park
4.0,M,horrible class night class and he kept us the whole hours everytime class was boring could get done in hour what we did in must go to every class takes attendence and partipation quizes every week final project most of grade group work during class makes it more liveable has a really bad underbite felt like a driver ed class
1.0,M,turned what could have been a great course into a trainwreck two-faced refused to answer students questions in class at a student hour he should be ashamed
4.0,M,cb demos were very helpful his lectures were a little dry his grading was way too tough for a credit graduate class he treated us like high school students
2.0,M,nice guy but class amounts to nothing more than long drawn-out crystal ball he messes with the lighting in class constantly during these also he has different expectations for performance levels between his quizzes and tests a tidbit he will not mention to you until after the fact
4.5,M,he is a good teacher in the beginning of the semester he will break the class up into groups if your group sucks your grade could go down a couple of points read read read that is the only way to get a good grade and make sure that you do the quizzes those are easy and at the end attendence is added to extra credit
5.0,M,i think that weber is the best professor that i have ever had of course keeping up with the readings is vital to your grade goes without saying but he is the best professor you can ever take he is an inspiration
4.5,M,he helps you keep up with the reading tasks by giving you quizzes he sets up the class in groups and that works out great at first he annoyed me but later in semester i came to understand what a good teacher he is if you are new to college responsiblities he will be challenging he prepared me for future college demands and i learned the value of studying in daily increments instead of
5.0,M,i had him in then transferred to ut-austin i had great profs at ut-austin but weber is still my all time favorite and most memorable he is truly inspiring
5.0,M,the class is hard if you read pretty much it if you are interested in learning which is why you should be in college then enjoy him i also went to the rome trip with him same work load worth the time and
4.0,M,i find his lectures very interesting and easy to follow my marks are lower in his classes than any other though take his course again because i like what he lectures about and how he lectures he also like black sabbath
4.5,M,wythe is one of the greatest men ever meet he is truly a wonderful person if you get the chance you should really try and get to know him
4.0,M,a socialist he has an irrational hatred of bush and all things a true believer and an honest man personally not intellectually his class is not very hard and will enlighten you but beware trying to indoctrinate you
3.0,W,class had a lot of busy work activities her grading is extremely hard and sometimes confusing
3.5,W,if she doesnt like your writing style your doomed i did not like her because when i asked her for help on a couple of essays she gave me responses and then marked me down for the way she told me to correct them shes nice but dont pick her if your writing style is unique and not to her liking
4.0,M,he was the hardest professor i ever had at u of l but he knew this topic and clearly conveyed it i made an a with him and i was not an a student during law school heard he was really hard for con law and i also heard you learn it
5.0,M,one of the best professors ever had he really has perfected the art of breaking down complex subject manner in a way anybody can understand he definitely takes the time to help you take him
3.5,M,i never missed a class made and some in law school and i got a d with him i was all prior to law school but i cared a little less in law school this class held my attention though i learned a lot but be ready for his finals consider yourself warned
4.0,M,love him very funny so he keeps your learn a lot plus you get to watch cops
5.0,W,some like her style one of those people who thought her class was great she teaches conlaw as bar prep not as historical study or philosophical discourse also one of the few people met who make my liberalness seem moderate to
1.5,M,such a bad prof class was very borning spent the whole time taking notes but not understanding them his answers to questions left me more confused than before i asked have never seen him without his fanny pack on
2.5,M,the midterm average was what else really has to be said writes fast all over the board continuously corrected by students however one-on-one actually really helpful the any questions thing wont even help you because so confused on what he just wrote and explained
5.0,W,cool professor i liked her style
3.0,M,he made me hate choir
3.0,M,i love him understand him
4.5,M,i love dr a very funny guy and a great he has some trouble remembering took him four times of meeting me to actually remember mine lol

1.0,M,does not communicate well with students in his online classes we very seldom heard a word out of this guy but if you want an easy a then go for it of course you still wont have a clue as to what the material means and you may need to repeat the class at a later time
4.5,M,cis became java instead of c this semester he was somewhat new to it and made mistakes while teaching but a lot of profs do even though he tried his best and he was a good teacher the best is his practice problems right before an exam which he goes over thoroughly if you know how to solve them you should do very well on exams
5.0,M,take him for and his stuff
5.0,W,dr specht is one of the best professors had some students find her intimidating but actually very nice especially if you see her out of class she knows how to write questions that require you to think and apply what you know as opposed to what memorized
4.0,M,took this clas over the a breeze the topics where interesting and i just really enjoyed the class if u are unsure about the ratinngs take him over the summer and i garantee you will like it

5.0,M,he is a great prof who knows what he is talking about the class will fly by
1.5,M,i just feel he is set in his ways and untouchable he is great when it comes to preaching and getting a class excitted and motived but when it comes to helping a student who may require extra time and slow the class down he gets frustrated he assumes that student doesnt take the class seriously or study he will offer to help but i would wonder if would expect the student to change to his stlye of learning not everyone learns the same auditory
4.5,M,i still remember when staton jumped on the table or picked on the girl in the front row as his girlfriend this guy is truly a great teacher funny lively the perfect class o wake u up
4.5,M,i have often referred to him as my hero he is like a cross between a fire ant and papa smurf

4.5,M,good professor interesting material and insight drones a little at times but generally keeps the attention of the class allows for discussion which is helpful assignments and tests are graded fairly and prof bush is there to help however he can
5.0,M,his insight is intriging makes you think and draws you into a deeper will gain so much out of this make you think diffrently about the diversity of pretty sexy this sly smile on his face so if you get a tad bored you can occupy your mind with great guy in general
5.0,M,all i can say is an amazing professor gives thorough insight into the readings so you feel like they were pointless like in other courses a genuinely nice friendly and approachable guy always smiled when i handed in a test or essay to him

1.0,M,horrible teacher his tests were unneccessarily hard and his classes were so boring that you never want to go he really should stop teaching
3.0,M,besides the fact that he mumbles constantly and gives hard tests the class too bad the lab boosts your grade and he grades tests on a curve lectures were somewhat interesting but a lot of people failed then again there was quite a few stupid questions asked by the students during lectures so you blame it all on him
4.0,M,the class is very easy if you actually go to all of the lectures and pay attention his tests were not hard at all plus he was very easy going and listened to any concerns you had

5.0,M,one of the best professors had at ucsd he is thoughtful and intriguing although i think what he says goes straight over the heads of most which is the fault of the closed minded student populace not him
5.0,M,my favorite professor so far he may have changed my attitude towards life if a christian he might convert you to something else

4.5,M,pavlic is a little bit eccentric but he a real intellectual he expects as much genuine interest in learning and writing about the material as he puts into teaching it which is to say a lot if students put in the time to read everyhting and pay attention in class the rewards are worth the effort

5.0,W,fun class she has a lot of energy and a lot to say she is very intellegent and enjoys talking to students i interviewed her for a project in another class and she spend several hours chatting with me about her feminist views which really helped me out and had nothing to do with her own class
4.0,M,i find it ironic that the people criticizing his english skills also happen to have had the most problems posting a coherent comment for this prof the irony is is if it you get it

2.0,W,nice lady interesting and knowledgable and likes her students but very bad at breaking things down so that they are clear for the students wanders off topic all the time many times will put her opinions and interpretations forward as the things we should learn rather than discussing and focusing on the ideas from the class readings
3.5,M,maybe a little scary at times but he really is helpful and a nice guy when it comes down to it
3.0,M,can be arrogant at times but overall he really does care and wants you to really avoid him if you have to take lab--so just get used to his style realize he has good intentions approachable most of the time

5.0,M,this prof is one of the best his sense of humor helps u remember and learn the material the workload is just right and his tests difficult but not easy either i would highly recommend him u will learn a lot
5.0,W,tosha was the best professor ever had bachelors and masters level included she also makes a wonderful advisor usually willing to take on new advisees
1.0,M,i actually went to the university and forged a complaint against him because he was at the point back in where he couldnt write clearly anymore everybody in class would ask him to translate his writing which are part of his lectures all done on an
4.5,M,top notch professor knows his ask him anything on entemology and he will have some info about it very well respected in the working community by biologists entomologists ecologists and the like helped me get a job now retired and doing what he wants
3.0,W,her grading system is rediculous homework and quizzes count double what tests count and if you do bad on a homework assignment you can have your grade drop a lot idid bad on one homework assignment took me from an a to a low c nice person and even a decent teacher but terrible grading system avoid her
2.0,W,her grading system totally sucks for tests and homework the only reason i went to class was because she was so strict about attendence
2.0,W,worst teacher ever she takes points off on a test if you mispell a word and last i checked this an english class seriously do not take this class with her as the professor
1.0,W,beware i have never failed a class before until this one i did all the work but her grading sucks stupid how she corrects hw she only picks questions out of the entire sheet and if u get the rest right except those she checks its an f she should not be teaching
1.0,W,she fails u on a test not because they answers are wrong but because u didnt put the equal signs in the right

4.0,W,very good prayers are with her as she just lost her son in iraq

4.5,W,a very nice teacher helps you understand it and test are not very hard but you must do your hmk to pass makes you study but she is a very good teacher
4.0,M,i love norm he makes you find the magic for yourself which can be frusrating but in the end it makes you so much more fulfilled
4.0,M,norm is great you have to buy into what he teaches like you do with all acting teachers in order to swear by him but once you submit and commit-he can change your life i encourage you all to at least try what norm has to offer before you judge it
3.5,M,norm is a great guy but he plays favorites also i seem to agree with his opinions on good theater
5.0,W,ms nelson is one of the best teacher she deal with the problem and visit desk to desk until the student is not clear she is very helpful and she makes the course very easir so i will not be able to find any teacher better than am planning to take the same teacher in the next calculus class but its my unfortunate that she is not going to tak
2.5,W,expects students to have learned the material before she teaches does not spoon feed but she also does not explain it very effective for most poeple a majority of the quizes doen by yourself and at home or online
5.0,W,a wonderful teacher shes always willing to go out of her way to help whether its on a one to one basis or in a group her teaching style is different but she manages to get you to think independently and question ideas rather than just mindlessly recalling stuff from memorization take her class its worth the work
5.0,W,ms nelson is an excellent teacher i am taking her for an online and her teaching and instructions are very comprehensive i would have her as a math teacher over anyone else she has great character and that says alot about a person
5.0,W,if students have a question she helps students a lot not only in the class but also in her office she has lots of enthusiasm to make people to understand and she gives good grade for tests also the style of her teaching makes people more focus on it therefore i would like to recommand her
4.5,W,true she has a different style of teaching that can be confusing at r hard but is a combination of quizzes and lecture she willing to help alot if asked she expects you to do outside work and spoon-feed the answers so you actually understand what doing
1.0,W,what ever the person below said was absolutly not recommend her ever
4.0,M,he is a good teacher class is not dat hard test are exactly from the exercises and not does exercies on the bord so it is easy
1.5,M,mr brown class is somewhat difficult he does give you of the test up front but you have to learn the material which i find hard he teaches the class as if you are familar with the subject i think the only one interested is himself you will have to study hard for his class
5.0,M,excellent teacher he is highly recommended
3.5,M,teacher although his expectations for the papers are unclear and it could be frustrating keep a positive attitude and give it a try he is very nice in to class it will be interesting if you actually read the books take again if i needed
1.0,M,this teacher is horrible he cannot make into class on time and then spends the rest of class talking about how he is smarter than all the people he works for
5.0,M,i loved this teacher he made the class so interesting and fun i had no interest in taking a speech class but it was a requirement i was so lucky to end up in his class he really lets you know what he thinks but in a nice way the few tests and assignments were easy and fun if every instuctor was like him college would be a breeze
2.0,W,the class was boring as hell i got an a and i have no clue how she is just a terrible teacher
4.5,W,easy teacher easy grader plays favorites so at least pretend to pay attention in class and at least once see her in her office
1.0,W,horrible teacher didnt really teach anything repeats herself often tells crazy stories unrelated to class gave term paper and didnt explain any of it dont recomend taking her class
5.0,W,she is one of the best teachers i have ever had she got me interested in economics and now it is my second major
5.0,M,ryan has a way of teaching that is just right for the english department his students thrive in the environment and the material put out is better because of his influence a great guy wonderful professor i highly recommend van cleave
5.0,M,he made himself very clear in what he expected he allowed the students to have a say in what was done in class and he helped keep me very hard to do in english
5.0,M,vancleave is the man i took him for a summer class and he is very fun he knows going on in the world and you have a chance for just random talks take him if you can but be sure to read the stories you will discuss them each day in class and he will give you a grade on participation
5.0,W,an excellent professor very organized assigns helpful materials and papers she has high standards and the material is tough but not a bad thing at all this class will give you a real challenge and teach you some very useful things just be willing to put in some effort ir research was my most stressful class but also my favorite
1.0,W,this rating serves to confirm the evaluations of others it doesnt matter how well done in other classes how high your gpa is or how much research done before this class will be useless and annoying take it wait another semester and take it with someone else she is the worst professor i have ever had
1.5,W,do not have her as a professor she expects yout to know everything with no explanation as to why or its purpose the papers were confusing and unclear at best the final was impossible and pointless unless you wrote down every single word she said throught the semester avoid at all costs
2.0,W,this class was hell on earth two major papers she outlines them but i still didnt know what she wanted from it then theres the final where you basically have to know everything about anything very stressful class
4.5,M,mark is a good professor he really teaches his classes as opposed to just sitting back i feel learning a lot more in int than i did in beginning different professor
3.5,M,with a habit of cutting to the quick he does expect abit much from the beginners but once you give him time and work with him one on one his methods become a bit clearer and his advice becomes much more sound a special study course with him would be the best bet for truly gaining from his teachings
3.5,M,mark is a very good teacher he may be disparaging about a students work but his feedback is though sometimes harsh is usually right on the money has high expectations but often helps students achieve thouse expectations
3.5,M,agree has expectations of advanced painting for beginners class like things painted in pastels likes a specific style of painting if you arent satisfied with a grade he gives you a chance to improve your painting thats nice

4.0,W,sweet lady lots of videos and some art stuff mostly reading from the text and lectures with some group work she assigns a few short easy papers good for ge
2.5,W,the class is a ton of work with a lot of reading and the lectures are kind of boring if you put some effort into the class do fine just try to get on her good side she can be kind of spacey and forgetful at times but not a bad person
1.5,W,very unclear about her expectations of assignments and rambles on in class never coming to a point her helper that came to class had to interpret everything after burga said it
1.5,W,it was a lesson in staying awake very very boring i completely lost my interest and desire to learn about this subject matter she is as monotone as it could possibly get
5.0,M,mr salvo is a genuinely kind-heart and all around nice guy he like having your grandpa for a band director
1.5,W,her class is hard there is no homework the only grades are tests if you suck at taking tests and rely on homework dont take her she is a really sweet person though
4.5,W,dr dunn is a great person and teacher but her class is not an easy a do your homework and get behnd you must study study study and not at the last minute she is willing to help anyone willing to help themselves
4.0,W,dr dunn is a great teacher but her class is no walk in the park you really have to study and do your homework or you just stay afloat in her class
3.5,M,he is a nutcase but awesome his courses are very interesting
5.0,M,grad i honestly used a lot of the info from his courses in my masters and for my psychology license i really appreciated how he fill up class time with bs and actually provided practical material
5.0,M,dr langley an amazing professor i always found his sense of humor well humorous and enjoyed the way he weeded out the not-so-bright individuals in our classes he is the reason i graduated from college
4.0,M,he is an okay teacher take notes and study them he tests from what notes he gives in class unless your in forensic psych he can be a jerk so try to stay on his good side most people dont like him but as far as learning goes hes it he knows his field sometimes he thinks he knows everything but like i said stay on his good side or he can m
5.0,M,this was one of the most useful classes i have ever taken it helped me learn the great variety that the field has to offer dr langley is smart and funny he rewards effort he does not play favorites although he certainly puts lazy students in their place trying to teach them to get their act in gear now before they go out in the real world
5.0,M,hilarious teacher very knowledgable in his area of study
4.0,M,well i think hot apparently the only one oh and his teaching is alright too

4.5,W,she knows her a freaking math genious to boot she really wants you to understand the material and is always very helpful and is more than willing to reexplain for clairity she also realizes that the material is extremely complicated so she makes the tests easy

3.0,M,do not be late to class if you are going to be late just go to the uc get your feelings hurt if you walk in late papers must include what he wanted you to talk about even though he clarify this before you turned it in grading is not fair just says to try harder next time read all the text book and understand it for test
3.5,M,he knows his stuff good class if you are interested in the subject but if just taking to get credit it could be a pain
3.5,M,avoid this man at all costs his tests are essays which he grades according to his opinions and what he thinks is important no extra credit and no make-ups cell phones are the devil to him and be late he will freak out on you
4.0,M,overall just a complete jerk rude to students and anyone elses view that differs from his is wrong
3.5,M,good teacher though it does feel like trying to brainwash you sometimes to believing his point of view raises interesting point i thought of a lot of work be prepared
2.5,M,for a level class he expected you to perform at a year grad level class it was ridiculous very boring very general in teaching but super-specific in testing do not take for lab extremely ridiculous in grading the labs do take him for very not for animal phys
2.0,M,i felt like he taught in a general sense and tested on a much more specific basis i do not like his teaching method
5.0,M,absolutely one of the best professors i have ever had he makes you feel like what you have to say is important and valid no matter what the case may be if he had not given me such a good impression i would have no further interest in philosophy he gives very fair tests does a great job preparing you for it and is considerate with his grades
3.5,M,goes very slow so he wont leave anyone who puts forth any effort behind

5.0,M,not quite sure why he has a bad reputation-simply go to his class dont when he asks questions if you take the time to talk to him after class or ask him questions actually very helpful and a genuinely nice guy his tests might be challenging but very straightforward about what you need to know-no surprises
4.0,M,i dont know what that idiot was smoking or on at the time wrote that but ryan although a very nice man is ridiculous as far as exams i dont know what this guy is thinking but he needs to understand that not every college student has countless hours a night to put in to studying towards his class we have other classes as well

3.5,M,i loved this class unlike the rest of these people if you go to class pay attention and do the handouts you will do fine i hate stats and managed to get an a in his class and i believe it had nothing to do with me being a girl he even know my name how could he just give me a good grade

4.0,W,a nice lady but she needs to understand that we have more than just the one course we always keep up and read ahead before we go to her class but she thinks that you dont do work at all just becuase you cant answer her questions in class still an a student in spanish but i have lost my interest in this language

3.0,W,paula moore is clueless to the world but she did give us a bunch of days off so she would get good feedback from the class

2.5,W,she is very nice as a person and grades papers fairly but i particularly like her choice of books for us to read also just as a note most of her classes seem discussion-centered and if she suspects that the class reading start giving pop quizzes
2.5,M,classes are not challenging he engage the students when he talks often one-tracked and opinionated course work is dull and repetitive ideal class for slackers nothing lost but time nothing gained
5.0,M,hes opinionated and a bit biased but hes got a good sense of humor and is fun to talk to if he can hear you he wont bust any chops for stupidity so avoid him during the summer semester good man though and will listen its a relaxing class nice if taking units
5.0,M,he is such an amazing prof i schedualed my classes for next semester around him so i could take another class from him

5.0,W,dr long is one of the most engaging professors at fairmont state she always has a smile on her face and knows how to enjoy a laugh but on the serious side i honestly believe that she should be in the public school system to catch some people before they slip through the cracks or before they get to college i think of a better role model
5.0,W,she loves the subject and that passion filters through into the students and makes them care about english and writing and has them want to learn english in this new light

3.0,M,ive taken steve twice and am about to have him again for my third advanced ceramics class listen to me if you are taking a ceramics class with him do not expect to learn how to throw expect to learn about quantum physics and conspiracy theories relating to aliens of course the other two wont teach you much either steve is good though
5.0,M,steve is seriously one of a kind even though it may take him hours to tell one story he is an amazing artist and if you actually listen to him alot of times his crazy letures really make you open your eyes about alot of stuff i will warn you if you procrastinate dont take him but its definitely a great experience take him again
5.0,M,the raw energy comment below is dead on steve can be a little much for the unprepared but sitting in a room listening to steve should be required for everyone on campus not a ceramics major but would def take him againfor anything
4.0,M,with out a doubt one of the most brilliant minds at the university he is the heart of the ceramics program at edinboro without him the program will die although he talks too much he is mostlikely the most knowledgable ceramicist in the world
5.0,M,you will not learn haw to throw in this class do not listen when he says to glaze greenware you pieces wiil be ruined
2.5,M,i took him for a summer course and found out that the man is indeed crazy will reach into kiln and grab pieces without gloves steve is like an encyclopedia though he knows more than what he can say
3.5,W,great person i recommend her as an advisor she was always willing to help but still vague it was a very challenging course and i just think i get cognitive psych
5.0,M,the sweetest kindest professor ever had so helpful considerate and kind take his class an amazing writer and an understanding human visit you in the hospital when you try to kill yourself
5.0,W,she is an awesome teacher she makes it so easy i used to suck really bad at math and now i feel like i know a lot of stuff and feel confident thanks to her awesome
5.0,W,awesome awesome awesome if you need help there but her style of teaching makes it so that there is really never a need for extra help she rocks
5.0,M,only had him once but the university needs more teachers like him
1.5,M,its like he doesnt want to teach he only comes to class cuz he has to its his job he needs to pay the bills i dont recommend him a bit
4.5,W,i like her she does talk very very fast lol but she is entertaining and out me to sleep very smart smart woman funny too some of the stuff she says is so off the wall and out of nowhere when she does to make a point but like lol that was funny
5.0,W,i had this prof for both social theory classes and she is a great teacher has a very extensive grasp of theory good relationship with students and very willing to help anyone who asks she challenges enough to be considered tough but not to the point where students are overwhelmed a definite asset to the school and the department
4.0,M,he is a good guy a fair grader and an interesting lecturer a really funny guy and he is open for discussion and student participation all of the time but can sometimes be a little opinionated when teaching the material i recommend him if you want to take an interesting class
1.0,M,he is the worst professor i have ever had
3.0,M,interesting material but sometimes have to strain to really be interested in it because his voice is monotone like others said not a prof readily available to help either so have to go out of your way there are better professors
4.5,M,freddy knows how to run a laid back yet thought provoking class he explains theories and hypothetical situatins with great clarity and humor tests are a bit hard but assignments are rare except for reading this class or any with kauf for that matter is worth taking whatever your major is
3.5,M,kaufman is very easy-going and his open class discussion instead of lecture keeps me awake and involved in class motivating me to express my opinions and thoughts if not interested in class discussion though it can get pretty boring his voice does have a slight drone to it but he can be funny
3.5,W,she kind of a bitter woman and a little mean takes some hard work to get a decent grade but if interested in the subject and willing to do the work work out
2.5,W,basically nike is a lot of fun but she is not the best teacher in a formal sense she is very interestng as a perosn though i love her
4.5,W,she gives a lot of homework and quizzes but is really enthusiastic and wants students to learn good about giving extra help outside of class and grades fairly
3.0,W,like her much picks her favorites and sticks with them such a young teacher but acts like years old
5.0,W,gives a lot of homework its pretty easy and is worth it very nice and just wants her students to do well
4.0,M,coop is an ass but he knows it i think just decided to run with it feel free to make fun of him he seems to enjoy it the class bad but you need to do some thinking on your own
4.5,M,classes are not really necessary but experiments are fun and the exams too difficult i really enjoy the case studies that he brings up in class he definitely is one of those teachers that you either like or you dont
1.5,M,i strongly dislike this man class is interesting enough but he spends the whole time talking about these interesting case studies and experiments that do not help you at all on the test the weekly quizzes are a pain and regularly going to class and reading book help you on the tests
3.5,M,hes not a bad teacher hes really boring with his powerpoint presentations but experiments make the class interesting basically no work all semester except for final
5.0,M,best of the best dean van bibber could learn a lot from him
1.0,M,needs to go take him if you like boring classes
1.0,M,worst counted once and he said right times in a half have no idea what he is ever saying right
1.0,M,i hated this class it was a waste of time and money the first week all you talk about is his althritis you dont do any geography unless you do the study guides he is a very nice person but he also is rude and belittles students for expressing their thoughts he also talks bad america
4.5,M,very laid back and easy going very fun teacher only bad thing is he is a state fan lol
5.0,W,this class should not be taken by any normal student at penn state beaver you need to read and learn to present arguments to things you normally wouldnt think of arguing she is a brilliant teacher probably one of the best on campus she is also a very good person to go to for advice because she is very knowledgable on most topics
4.5,W,she is slamming hot
5.0,W,dr chirico is an awesome teacher she likes when you have an opinion and even disagree with her opinions sometimes as long as you talk and have an opinion in class she will love you the hours of community service can be rough but rewarding in the end she tries to help the community
5.0,W,she is a great professor who really knows what doing unfortunately her courses are very difficult and not worth it do not take this course for a simple gs credit unless you like writing atleast paper a week and hrs community service take econ for the same gs credit very easy
3.5,W,i know where to start or end her class is definitely not fun but she is very very clear probably good especially in math if you are interested in a hardcore math class take hers she is the chair of the math and computer science department so she misses some days too because of meetings overall i would rate her a b the rest i
2.0,W,she is the most boring teacher in the world especially in her two hour class do not take her class whatsoever she looks like she is back from the dead
4.0,W,go to lecture take notes study be fine unlike many professors she has a heart so talk to her if things workin out so hot for you and work with you
5.0,W,dr w has high expectations but that will make us successful when we get out of psbvr when the student puts forth effort she will go out of her way to help even outside of class she cares about her students but gets frustrated when people fulfill their potential when she came here the dept was in chaos she saved it my favorite prof
5.0,W,a very hard class but an awesome teacher all the people that say she teach well are just too lazy to apply concepts she want you to memorize she wants you to actually learn something and gives you stories that apply to concepts so you understand the material better
5.0,W,dr wroble is the best professor ever had yes the work she assigns is very hard and very challenging but a psych degree is not going to be handed to you on a silver platter you have to work for it sure the bad ratings are from students that expect to have handed to them
4.5,M,great guy and knows his stuff he clearly defines and shows everything either on his projector or the board really good at explaining things keep on top of work or oit will overwhelm you
4.0,M,great guy very clear and knows what talking about the tests were very straight foreward as were the assignments and his odd expressions and variety of coloured markers help keep your attention if starting to drift keep on top of the work otherwise it will seem harder than it is
4.5,M,i took the dr in a short summer class scared out of my mind of public speaking i ended up learning a lot from him and learned a lot he is a really cool interesting guy he tolerate any bs and can tell when someone is making an effort or not if you try and show potential he will notice i look forward to another of his classes
5.0,W,best teacher i ever had sad to see she teaching this semester
5.0,W,excellent teacher always willing to answers your questions i would recommend her to any students interested in graphic design she is able to relate real world experience to us
4.5,M,the best professor i have had by far he will definitely help you and give you a chance to do well he is available for help and more than willing to meet half way one of the best accounting professors including on a prestigious university level
5.0,M,muckell is the absolute best nyack should be lucky to have him he is honestly the only reason i ever even stayed at nyack the school has so many problems and is so messed up it needs more people like muckell

5.0,M,he is awesome aleks is obnxious but all have to do it he gives quiz outlines explains everything is a very simple subject as well especially if into math he is flexible and approachable he make any students feel dumb like i would a
3.5,M,this prof is not that bad but the aleks and comp assignments is what kills u the thing i like about this prof was how he allowed everyone to get up and try to explain the subject and he just sat yeah if he knows your name he will pick on ur the type of person that like doing hw i recommend him
5.0,M,awesome teacher really knows his geometry very clear explains very well and has always helped me even when i his student

1.5,M,he needs to learn how to teach he knows alot about his field but has no skill of teaching there are only students in the class and he remember all of our names he should go back to school and learn how to teach
1.0,M,only got the job because married to sra budd and it shows care about the success of his students total nightmare just like his wife

5.0,M,i agree w most of the an old school liberal a wonderful man and one of the most thoughtful professors come across at bowdoin lectures can drag sometimes but truly interested in his students thoughts and is never a mean or spiteful grader take a class with him
5.0,M,great teacher interested in his students and willing to take time to help
5.0,W,really easy class i got a overall even buy the book i never opened it make sure u go to class cuz u get quizzes and homework assignments that r not on blackboard those really enhance your grade easy class and she is a good fun teacher
5.0,W,excellent professor dont buy the book you will never open it powerpoints on blackboard show up to class and you will for sure get at least a b she really knows her stuff and is very enthusiastic about it
5.0,W,class is easy usually relatively easy and always ends early tests are not bad just show to class and you will cruise she is also a nice woman who really knows her subjects you for sure do not need to buy the book
3.0,W,i dont like her as a professor she favors students within the environmental facet of geology over the rest of us you never get any tests or assignments back and are never given a rheubric to begin with her powerpoints are boring and the required book is useless i hated her half of
4.0,W,a very good teacher she does sort of appear snobby but u have to get over that false assumption she tells you basically the fundamentals of writing an excellent paper if u follow then u should have no problem getting a grade no lower than a b
4.5,M,professor was very knowledgeable in the field does good reviews for tests no attendance policy just print out slides and study pulls questions for the test out of slides i would definately reccommend bad reviews below are for his level classes
4.5,M,i agree with the last two ratings this teacher is very nice and modest he gives you all the information needed to pass the class powerpoint slides are all you need to pass the class i have no idea where those other ratings came from but pay attention to them
4.0,M,he makes the class very easy gives lots of hands on examples can get an a on the tests just by studying the lecture notes for hours very nice guy
5.0,M,one of the better teachers in the school very willing to help and can explain things in different ways large amount of busy work but tests are basically given from past tests which he posts also very funny and acts like just one of the guys
5.0,M,he is awesome i love halfman because he is just a nice guy that will answer any question you have and never make you feel dumb he is great take any class of his

5.0,W,most beautiful professor ever i guarantee i miss her more than anyone summer is so smart down to earth smokin hot and really funny too all of her lectures were great but the one on cmc and wbts were my favorite i hope i see her again on campus but her modeling career has taken off
5.0,W,this was a cool easy class summer always tried to make it fun sometimes it worked actually just looking at her is fun great teacher nice cool beautiful
5.0,W,she is a great teacher the tests are a little hard but i loved her
5.0,M,reardon is one of the few engish teachers i have had that allowed for insiteful discussions instead of plenty of bs the literature he has his students read is very eye-opening and worth reading if at all possible be sure to signup as one of his students
3.0,M,not recommended if you want to work very ver hard though a good teacher he asks far too much for a lower level class not supposed to be as difficult as it was there are no reviews for tests and the tests are very very hard he does curve them but you have to in a class like this he is fun and does enjoy what he does
4.5,M,nothing to fear in this class it may look impossible at first but it ends up being quite manageable his bark is much worse than his bite make an effort to understand the material and make an effort to make sure you understand it
5.0,M,great teacher hated english till i took this class very considerate teacher mind if your cell phone goes off like other teachers he is very understanding funny and entertaining also
4.5,M,he is one of the most enthusiastic and off the walls professors ever meet his grading is very fair the exams bad considering you can use a notes sheet lots of iclickers so you have to show up to class no book used take this class its fun and interesting
3.0,W,really teach the class she just breaks us down into small groups and we have to read and do group discussions every class not much homework gives you study guides for the exam but doesnt really review overall dont take her if you dont like group discussions and if you teach yourself
4.0,W,she is a very good teacher she loves the subject she has a quiz every week but like one question and writing your already of the quiz boosts up my grade for sure the exams are pretty easy but i still fail them lol still gives you credit for speaking up in class and she likes it if you sit in the first rows
5.0,W,dr white is a fantastic instructor she is very passionate about pr and gets the class involved so that you falling asleep she offers daily quizzes to check attendance and to help boost your grade she is absolutely wonderful and someone i admire greatly
4.0,W,this class was extremely easy is a great professor attendance is mandatory and she has worksheets that she takes up every week on the worksheets let you do corrections so hard to get anything but a she drops your lowest grades from every section so this is an easy a
4.0,W,professor campos is a good professor make sure to complete the assignments and keep them after she returns them because you will need them in the future for your writing journal grade tests are pretty easy if you come to class sometimes takes attendance for extra credit at the end of the year i enjoyed this class and did learn something
4.0,W,ms campos is a nice person scattered sometimes she does take roll and has an online lab that has about assignmets per every two weeks but most lang classes will understanding and very lenient she speak amazing english but she is understandable if naturally good spn i recommend if not need to work a little
2.0,W,there is no textbook she passes out sheets or just reads a sheet out to you everyday not too much reading aloud she seems unorganized and teaches to students who already know spanish well if you she tells you to go study on your time i learned more spanish in high school
5.0,W,lots of reading in the book tests were fairly easy professor reid is amazing she made the class fun and enjoyable we got to choose our own topics and the selections were great there is some work to do and turn in for speeches planning reports and preparation outlines but easy once you know what going to talk about
4.5,W,great teacher she really explains the materials well as long as you attend her class and pay attention to her lectures do great on the tests
5.0,W,not an easy a must do everything to a t to do well she plays favorites and i was definitely not one my advice would be to get on her good side and you should do well
4.0,W,her class was simple so simple it was completely boring everything is common sense and nothing deeper if you want a simple class that is uninspiring then it might work for you i did appreciate the absences policy
5.0,W,i would definitely recommend this professor took her inter comm class and got an a out of it although she is friendly and fun in class do take her deadlines seriously
2.0,M,whoa this man is kind of crazy expect to put a lot of work into his class and not really understand what he is saying does not believe in grade inflation like the rest of the world
5.0,M,his class is fun and interesting the test is fair every thing is covered during lectures overall he is a great teacher i would recommand him for anyone
5.0,M,he is awesome i love going to his class every day i know some people say he goes very fast but he takes the time to answer questions and makes sure that every body is clear because he talks fast his class keeps me focused and alert and excited as long as you take the time after class to look through the material you would do great
2.5,M,he expects way too much mechanisms for the final are you kidding me he does not realize that impossible to test everything on an exam he will have a question about everything very few people finish the tests in time because they are excessively difficult and he goes over info in his lectures way too fast too bad he is the only choice
5.0,W,great class i learned so much and the professor was fantastic she even gives you an excellent study list prior to major exams i found her course to be enjoyable the labs were fun too however it is not a course for lazy must study
2.0,M,online class could take quizzes and tests over until you make a just manage your time so you can do that not much help when you email him you allowed to see the midterm or final and my grades were very low compared to tests so i suspicious about the answers one test have them all loaded into the system not good to me
4.0,M,understand why these people like him very understanding if you need to make up and gives you partial credit on tests if you got the wrong answer but were headed in the right direction i loved his class
2.0,M,mr robertson is one of the worst math teachers ever his teaching methods are strange all he does is go into tangents that have no relation to the work his tests are very difficult including the final the only good thing about him is his ability to work with you if you miss teacher
1.0,M,horrible unless you like a drill sargent all i ever head him talk about is the pressure to get out of his class if you ask for clarification you get a quick response not to the question you asked and walks away then he spends time helping one other student for the entire you have math anxiety he is probably the worst choice
4.5,W,fair and knows what talking about lectures are inconsistent sometimes she hides behind the podium and other times she is engaged and charismatic buy the textbook you can get away with just going to class i liked her and would take her again
5.0,W,she knows what she is talking about she is very clear this is exactly how a history class is supposed to be her tests are very easy
2.0,W,she hids behind a podium reads from her notes the whole class and has next to no interaction with the class you have to go to her lectures as they are exactly the same notes that she posts online as my first taste of a university level history class i can say that i am not impressed anless u plan on a hst major dont take this class
5.0,W,she is a great prof very liberal and approachable no need to buy textbook just study wikipedia for the exams everything is good except there is a long assignment to do
5.0,W,amazing she presents the material in a way understandable answers every question and does practice problems hw every night questions tests too hard and really friendly
5.0,W,wonderful professor was struggling in the beginning she took her time made sure i understood what she was talking about if you can take her whenever possible
4.5,W,the best chemistry teacher i have ever had i doing well in chem and i always went to her for answered every single question and took time after class to help me curved my grade which saved me she rocks
5.0,M,alexakos is one of the best teachers had at santa fe i took philosophy my first semester and failed so i was dreading round but he is so passionate about the material and so approachable in and out of class the assignments and tests are easy and he loves to help with the word essays assigned throughout the semester
5.0,M,he is not interested in your commentary on the test or vague questions that leave other students looking for the blackberry ask only questions that will help you or others understand the material and you will be fine if you are interested in hearing yourself talk go somewhere else
4.0,M,he teaches good philosophical ideals but he does not follow them himself in the class discussions he likes to cut people off before they can finish their sentence he has some interesting concepts though and teaches the class well there are only four graded papers composing of your grade in the class dislike
4.5,M,i love philosophy taking it with him was great respect him always go to class get the concepts read what he assigns and be able to write a decent essay be scared to ask questions or share what you think but he will tell you when you are wrong hahaha
5.0,M,panos is an excellent philosophy teacher who knows his stuff very well he is indeed hard and will tear you down if you dont know what your talking about but if you are respectful and attentive in his class you will do fine also study and read all information given to you and come to class regularly i got an a because i did all these things
1.5,M,dr alexakos will expect you to write a phd level paper in his class if you are cool with a b this wont be a problem if you want an a take someone who is actually willing to give them for undergraduate level work
1.0,M,ever choose this professor for any course i took him for a hunger class and he absolutely hated me for no reason very rude and arrogant he gave me a c in the class when i calculated my grade to be a b this man is corrupt and bases grades on how well he likes you
4.0,W,i had her for intro tap she was a lot of fun to have as a teacher i have been tapping since i was little so i knew a lot already but she had a totally different way of tapping then what i was used to i found this experience a lot of fun and i am definitely looking forward to taking more classes with her
2.0,M,was very unprofessional during group presentations as he often always interrupts speakers in the middle of their presentation and would even answer his own questions in the end without waiting for class discussions quizzes and midterm are an easy even if just skimmed the chapters and read his slides beforehand
3.5,W,this professor is incredible people may hate her because she has you read some books you probably never would but its because she does that that she really expands your world and thinking if you enjoy reading and thinking outside the box take her a great first english class to take if your an english major especially
2.5,W,hmm not really sure how i felt about this teacher some days i liked her and others i she requires you to buy like books for her class and you go through one a week class is just a discussion on what you read if you like reading and talking out loud take this class however i did not say a single word and still passed with a c
4.0,W,final grade may be participation but speaking in class is really not required i spoke about times got on papers and got an a in the course i think as long as she recognizes that you are reading the texts and you are paying attention in class good in her book if you mind reading take her
3.5,W,this class is complicated at best the class is seminar format with group discussions on every book she gives insane writing assignments that make no sense she is very nice but the papers should be used for a creative writing class not this overall though its an easy class of the grade is simply showing up the other is essay-based
1.0,W,awfulll you have to buy a bunch of books and read them within a week about pages of reading for each class do not recommend at all also her grading system is horrible based on how much you talk in class but she doesnt let u kno how u are doing mid semester and very rude to students horrid experience
5.0,M,professor grobstein was an incredibly engaging and downright lovely professor i am very grateful to have had the opportunity to share stories with him he will be greatly missed rebekah
4.5,M,this is not a traditional science class by any means in fact a great class for non sciencey people who need a science credit but it is definitely element other people complain about his philosophizing but that is exactly what this class is about so it was perfect fun interesting class
5.0,M,paul is an amazing professor he was able to take very complex principles and fully explain them to the class i left the class with more than i would have every hoped for he teaches science with a philosophy twist and although i started the class completely perplexed by the natural sciences i now feel passion for them great experience
3.5,W,she can be tough but fair as long as you do your assignments be fine
3.5,M,the easiest guy you could have found in the whole brooklyn college english department for this course i was lucky to have found him we read couple of stories wrote two papers and one final paper for the semester and the entire class got an a thats amazing and kool he is not teaching any more but we need professors like him
3.5,M,kerstein is a nice old man with impeccable hebrew pronunciation old-fashioned but usually in a charming way and will not teach you current hebrew the textbook is fantastic even though he jumps around in it worth taking if interested in hebrew not the best but he too bad either
4.5,M,you go wrong with this professor he has a genuine interest in helping you learn the material and is flexible
4.5,M,he is very nice his class was fun also his tone is a lil monotone but all in all a great professor
5.0,M,very humble but very funny and full of wit he is very knowledgeable and wants everyone to do well and actually learn he is highly recommended
1.0,M,laziest professor i have ever met attendance not mandatory just have to read the book his book and the whole thing front to back he tells you what he says in class is not important because its in the book read know the terms and give you everyone the same grade a b
4.5,M,people that dont like lecker do not apply themselves in class he is beyond helpful always encourages students to see him in office hours he encourages participation which makes the class more interesting take a class with him great prof
1.5,M,he picks favorites and if not on his good side or you agree with his ideas he makes you pay i have never had an issue with a professor but he is awful trust me stay away
5.0,M,prof lecker changed my life perspective made me a better writer and helped me find a career all in one course i found him to be a fascinating lecturer although the course i took with him was a conference of not a lecture he was always very interested in his students and visiting him at office hours is great he is challenging awesome
4.5,M,i highly recommend lectures were crystal clear and based on the book he always gave examples to support the theories he discussed and his exams were fair you just have to put in the effort and study take him i really enjoyed his class
5.0,W,her class is hard you must do homework show-up for class but she is very helpful knows what talking about i would say her class is for self-starters who need little guidance tests are good if you did asked questions when needed people who fail her class do the or ask clarifying questions
4.0,M,this class was pretty hard he did his best to teach it and knew what he was talking about but many students were lost he also got annoyed when people would ask questions during class overall it was decent
4.0,M,i took him for biolab i was scared because i have never had a science lab before it ended up being a great time he is fun and helpful the lab was pretty easy
2.5,W,study study and study the text book and do the sample question she give quizzes with max question the questions can have part anwers to it she does not curve she teaches from powerpoints and the last half hour of class are sample problems for the upcoming test she knows her class is hard again study everything she gives you
2.5,W,very hard and she knows it she explains the first class in order to pass her test you must study note power pt and read text book the test questions arent study terms and definitions they are how to connect terms if you take this corse good luck i got a c
3.0,W,her tests are indeed hard and inconsistent with anything in lectures take if you are willing to read or more pages a night and somehow retain random knowledge for the tests otherwise avoid she is very knowledgeable however and very friendly not a terrible teacher but her tests are really really hard
3.5,W,very nice lady tends to not describe all topics very clearly and tends to go off on tangents about feminism she is very opinionated and she wants it known chances are you will probably disagree with her at some point but she does make you learn she is also kind of flexible on grading i certainly did better than i thought i would
4.5,W,she is one of the greatest professors had so far she has a way of connecting real life with the things we have to learn in class to make everything interesting you have to do the reading otherwise fail the tests read and come to class and do fine
3.0,W,the initial meeting of her was deceitful very liberal and vocal about it in which opposite i thought i would hate the class but loved it very passionate about what she does and it shows she will open your mind for sure a great class to take because she truly is brilliant on this topic
4.0,W,i thought to myself upon entering her she is a die-hard liberal and i am not going to be happy however i would recommend her to everyone considering poli sci she will open your mind to things you previously have never thought of i can truly say she is brilliant a little scattered which hurt the brilliant
4.0,W,a really good teacher but her class can be boring sometimes i went like times in the whole semester and still got an a because i studied for her tests must do the readings very important
4.0,W,very fun class probably because it was a level though great discussions on the material and she did answer most questions students had tests hard either again being level class likely played a huge part in this as well
5.0,M,i signed up for this cities course not expecting much out of it but it grew on me so much that i enjoyed coming in to class he makes it very interesting if you like history some funny jokes grading is quite easy exam questions are given beforehand so you can study for them i love how i learn most in classes that require much studying
4.0,M,one of the best classes i have taken at uconn enjoyed the material and his teaching style only complaint is time granted on the tests overall great class

4.5,M,i loved his class i definitely recommended taking his class
4.5,M,i had cooke for a once a week class for population geography i thought that he was entertaining and kept the class relatively light considering some of the material only exams and a paper for grades i enjoyed the class and so long as you attended and took a few notes you will be prepared for the exams
5.0,W,she is an amazing lecturer and i love going to class she keeps the class very interesting and the lectures are very informative and fun she keeps the students engaged all the time overall if you are going to take a class in which she is teaching will not want to drop the class going to be super awesome and you will learn amazing
3.5,W,buy the book because she basically only grades you on discussed in class attendance mandatory but in-class worksheets are random and count for a grade i like how few grades there were the class was out of points she uses a lot of examples to make concepts clear
1.5,W,powerpoint reader this professor makes absolutely zero effort to take what is clearly collective of knowledge and turn it into a forum for active discussion or a lesson instead keeps on keepin on with the stupid powerpoints that come along with the book she made us waste on based on this worst prof ever had
3.5,W,interesting class frequently in spats with the uni president and teaches from her perspective as a lesbian feminist excellent for learning about civil liberties in constitutional law
3.0,W,is my favorite teacher at usm so far she really makes you think from a different perspective she is very opinionated and not afraid to tell you hers same as all of the other comments do not make her mad
5.0,W,best instructor ever be prepared to work work work if you do and you listen and take criticism the world is yours carey will prepare you for anything although her classes are if you come prepared and show initiative you can usually be let go to work on your own she will allow you to succeed on your own if you can
4.5,M,one of the greatest professors ever have i took ancient world with him a class that i particularly interested in but he made it relevant and interesting i loved a higher grade but i regret taking it an awesome person to know dean of arts sciences and really cares about his students take his class
3.0,M,he will help you out when you need it he confused me on alot of things but hes a good man accounting the easiest thing to teacher
4.5,M,he is a cool professor to have and i think he made the class kind of fun i would recommend him for any class since dr ibrahim i very helpful and will try to give real life examples to chemistry problems
5.0,W,best teacher ever very easy the class very interesting and makes you feel like you want to be there take her
5.0,W,great learning fun tough exams but she explains the material really well of fun activities in class
1.0,M,he is the worst professor ever he is unfair and rather talk about his personal life than actually teaching the class i spent so much time reading homework threaded discussions i always completed everthing at and he still gave me grades according to how he felt he is an awful teacher dont waste ur time money and stress by takin
4.5,M,i got a b i got a b for the first time in my life i understood math prof quereshi is very helpful take him if you have a very difficult time with numbers just be sure to do homework and ask questions if you need help yey quereshi
4.0,M,a really nice teacher he gives a lot of examples during lecture which helps your understanding a lot homework quizzes and exams are easy
4.5,M,prof quereshi is the best math teacher ever had struggled with algebra before but with him i found it really easy awesome professor funny and also approachable just do your homework and keep your green sheet handy and be fine the best math professor ever had
4.0,M,quereshi is a funny teacher take his class if you are looking to pass math i hate math but he made it not so bad
4.0,M,great teacher he has an accent but you can still understand him very funny aswell easy a just do your classwork and homework and set
3.0,M,pretty easy teacher if you want an easy a get him but beware his english is not good
4.0,W,she asks more questions than she answers and she sometimes lectures on material that is irrelevant to the course however her lectures are still interesting and informative plus her exams are ridiculously easy
5.0,W,this professor rests at the top of my list not because i finished her course with an a but it is because of the passion that drives her to do what she does she uses power-point and other forms of multi-media to materialize theoretical abstractions she comes off intimidating at first but she is great once you get to know her her exams great
4.0,W,ananya is clearly passionate about her research and this shines through she does ask a lot of questions but only to engage students she provides you with a critical lense to think but sometimes her bias comes through but she deny that she is bias good prof
2.5,M,i have taken stats before at another uni and had to take it again at york i decided to take the online course hassan and the ta never respond to questions and when i wanted to discuss my assignment mark he could barely explain to me what i did wrong i really did not like him as a teacher maybe it was just the online aspect
1.0,M,beware of dr fernando as a professor or advisor he does not teach to broad learning styles in students it can be a serious problem for someone who needs to understand plant science taught by him he relies on textbooks when answering questions he was more intolerant and unhelpful than any other teacher i have ever had
2.5,M,i like his lectures and labs its the exams which i find completely absurd what is emphasized in class is not what is tested on rather there is a very heavy focus on material specifically not emphasized unless you are capable of memorizing every little thing he says you are stuck with a passing but mediocre grade on the exams
5.0,M,best finance professor ever he knows his work and teaches it with a passion funny and really cares about his students he sometimes brings donuts to class highly recommend him
5.0,M,great teacher highly recommended i always go to class but you can really get behind if you doing the homework really helps to get in gear for the tests the tests bad except the final which he has no control over and which i felt completely unprepared for however he gives a mighty curve for it
5.0,W,you would be hard pressed to find anything negative about dr sinning you will learn more in this class than in any other class she has been teaching at wmu for over years and instead of being lazy and reaping the benefits she has only kept improving on the quality of teaching amazing professor wmu is lucky to have her grading very fair
5.0,W,dr sinning may be the best accounting professor at wmu she helps you learn more than you could ever think of if you are going into tax for a career you will be very happy you had her at the end of the semester you will have a solid understanding of basic tax she does demand that you work hard though grading is very fair go to class
1.5,W,useless avoid at all cost had a great deal of interest in finance before this class but she killed it with her unorganized lectures hard marking and questions on exams outside the study material never again mate never
4.5,W,i only took the week online course so there much interaction but modules pinpoint the main concepts quite responsive and course is very easy with her open-book mc midterms and quizzes are fair as long as you read the book and do the problems module exercises very fair final problems and mc gives out bonus marks
1.5,W,she never checks her email and uses outdated information she also needs to grade on more than just attendance i would suggest taking this class because its an interesting topic but not with her
2.0,W,poitless class learned absolutley nothing attendance is a must dont miss day or you will more then likely fail otherwise class was xtreamly boring and her teaching style is dull
1.5,W,entirely attendance based no emphasis on knowledge gained and she talks about the exact same thing everyday either you have perfect attendance and you get a or you miss days and get a
3.0,W,very easy its all in attendance really boring though mid sem exam you take in groups only hard thing is your final paper which she does not go over if you want a take her
3.0,W,going to the lectures seemed completely pointless she talks about the same things every day and hard to even stay awake i felt like i wasted money and time being in her class and learned hardly anything
5.0,W,i throughly enjoyed this class attendance is a must i learned alot from her
3.0,W,if you like kindergarten teachers like her she literally will pull you out of class if missed a day regardless of the circumstances take this class if far from campus or in the winter for that matter because if late your ass show up and the class is mind numbingly easy waste of money
5.0,W,she was very awesome if you go to class and participate you will do well i never opened the book got a i also got on the final paper she just is extremly nice and helpful i love her
2.0,W,she was a fairly easy teacher but all she seemed to ever talk about was attachments she did not make the class interesting at all and did not make it very clear what we needed to know for the tests
5.0,W,very knowledgeable professional peg sets her students up for success she is very helpful and wants her students to really learn about the subject material
1.0,W,this is the worst teacher i have had in my years as a full time student at she is undereducated and asks for class input but if you speak up and agree with her she will embarrass you in front of the class and make you feel stupid she is completely ignorant and the other psych profs i have had at lcc have agreed that she is a bad pro
1.0,W,she has no idea what talking about a complete bafoon do not take this class it is dull and she is obnoxiously uneducated on the subjects she is supposed to be teaching
1.0,W,she was a terrible teacher she had a very biased outlook on psychology and all she taught was attachment theory she teach about the proven methods of mental disorder reasons and treatments do not take her unless you want to learn incorrect information and want to be bored out of your mind
4.5,W,greta was a really nice laid-back accessible funny english teacher i never felt like i was necessarily her student or that i was in an english class because she cares about engaging all of her students in their education treating us as adults she will be more than help you on essays or whatever so go to her office hours an easy a
5.0,W,i had to write a review after all the not-so-flattering ones that we posted about greta an amazing teacher who is nice accessible wants to help and is easy to talk to go to her office hours and tell you what to write for your essays no homework to tests or quizzes no mid-term just essays take greta
4.0,M,take his class if only because super easy all you really have to do is show up and remember enough to pass three very simple exams i notice most of the negative reviews here have to do more with him as a person than his teaching yes he is a snarky elitist old conservative papist but he adds some fascinating commentary
3.5,M,i passed his class with a b he was unpleasant at times and his teaching style was very old-world he did have a unique take on history anti-american anti-atheist anti-lutheran etc compared early christians to hippie welfare bums he is very full of himself but his class too hard to pass if you take decent notes easy tests
3.5,M,he is a wonderful teacher and very enthusiastic about history i took his express this past fall and passed with a b he is lecture based so interrupt the class wait until after the class you really need the textbook but i would advise to attend class and be a good note taker i will definitely be taking him in the hist
5.0,M,he wont answer questions during lecture wait until after class to ask any read the book as he does refer to it but the book lacks certain detail great guy if you attend class and pay attention his class is easy and he is willing to help anyone if they ask for it
5.0,W,wonderful teacher i have disliked math for many years but mrs dameron helped would take her class again
5.0,W,she is a wonderful teacher she makes everything crystal clear and always returns email i am taking her see her once a week with any questions i have a she has helped me all you have to do is cc and tests at the end of the semester you can retake the lowest test so you make a better grade and do the extra credit that she gives
5.0,W,she is the sweetest teacher ever she will help you out any chance she gets but u will earn ever single grade u get n her u want to earn extra credit u better do all the extra credit assignments she give not she will not be giving u no extra points to move a letter overall she is the best teacher ever

5.0,M,just plain out take him u wont regret it
5.0,M,mr unger is a great teacher i took his online class for hum he states everything clearly as far as deadlines and objectives he is understanding and helpful i would do a few quizzes a week and reviewed those for the final and passed turn the journals in on time they are a great portion of your points very self paced relaxed class

3.5,M,he is a very nice teacher and willing to work with every student he gives alot of extra credit go to class every day and take good notes use the outline make sure to study very hard for the tests though he is funny and classes are interesting
1.0,M,he is all over the place and it is very difficult to tell where he is at in the lecture so you really keep up would not recommend to anyone the only good thing about him is that he gives a little extra credit
5.0,M,i am surprised at the low ratings for this prof he is really a good teacher if you pay attention take good notes just study for the exams it is an easy class he is very helpful offers extra credit his lectures are interesting he is clear in his speech is the content is very understandable it is an easy a if you prepare for exams
2.0,W,a really sweet old lady but if you have a ta in the class then have no idea going on or what to expect out of projects our ta basically translated everything to us individually after she tried explaining it as a whole she really is pretty knowledgable about design but she realize that we know anything yet
1.0,W,livingston is probably one of the worst teachers at philau not only does she not teach she grades extremely hard on the test you have and fails the entire class she is not a historian or a architect teaching architecture history do not take her class if you want to pass this course highly unrecommend
4.0,M,prof coleman was an amazing man a great professor indeed he had high expectations and kept students working hard for a good grade college isnt supposed to be easy thank you for the stories memories and belief in myself you were an amazing man that cared for his students and their future and may your legacy live on

5.0,M,great teacher alot of experience in the industry and it shows in his teaching methods anytime you need help he is willing to give you his time
5.0,W,was the absolute greatest math teacher ive ever had she was a sexy woman and could make a math class very entertaining i am absolutely crushed she is retired
4.0,M,tim is a nice guy and loves to help if asked he will assign a lot of reading if you can stay on top of that you should do fine he allows rewrites probably one the few teachers who is easy and at the same time brings out your best writing skills he is also quite interesting and brings so many ideas to discuss likes to incorporate film music
3.0,M,first off he is definitely not hot ew secondly he is a decent teacher but he picks favorites and makes it blatantly obvious who those individuals are his criticisms on are harsh rude and not helpful in one word arrogant
3.0,M,he is very helpful in class but he will grade your labs very strict he will also leave rude comments on everything he grades
5.0,M,i thought this class was easy but i am amazing at math but even if you good at math he makes sure that everyone understands going on
5.0,W,took an online speech class with her need to read the whole book but the material was easy to read she is readily available for questions awesome teacher
1.0,M,his notes help you on exams
1.0,M,kinda rude if you ask him for help and not sympathetic at all
1.5,M,the good he gives you the notes and the sample problems the bad is that the lectures are dull and less exciting than just reading the book he has a particular way that you have to work problems on test but does not use that method when showing problems all of your points lost will be format errors not cause you understand the subject
1.0,M,hard to stay awake and pay attention too much material to go through to prepare for tests would not take him again unless you absolutely have to or if this is the only class taking take him
1.0,M,our class signed a petition against the way he teaches to give to the school board it was a challenge to pay attention for more than minutes i had to repeat my question to him times once until i was almost screaming
4.5,W,dr burns may be unorganized but she really tries to make the material interesting and has a lot of unique knowledge about working class backgrounds she is also very approachable and is interested in different student perspectives the video choices of hers are also great
2.0,W,mrs self proclaimed medical terminology wizard needs to attend a course on common courtesy she comes off as arrogant and will not return calls i think she even makes up some of the acronyms used if you are already pretty fluent in med term and need a somewhat easy class then take this class if not look elsewhere
4.5,W,this was by the far the hardest class taken at byu expectations are extremely high but i learned so much and am grateful i had her as a teacher because every other class will probably seem extremely simple compared to hers a lot of work reading writing but she really knows her stuff and helps you whenever you need it
4.5,W,best senior course out there there is a lot required of you reading watching films etc but none of it is wasted time the midterm and final projects are difficult but nothing you expect she is open and willing to help you with your writing and become a better writer from taking her class amazing professor beautiful class
4.5,W,i took dr class duing my junior year a year senior now getting ready to graduate and i can say that she has been the most influential professor i have had at byu the principles she taught stuck even if or especially because i had to work for them
4.0,W,i took a class from professor siegfriend about a year ago and i still find myself thinking about the thinks she taught us she has high expectations graduating soon and realizing that she was probably one of the most influential professors had changed the way i look at the world highly recommended
5.0,W,this class was so awesome if trying to decide between professors i would definitely choose her she made us work hard but she believed in our ability so i never felt like it was impossible her lectures were inspiring and i always learned something really cool about her class is the applications it has to other areas of life
1.0,M,dr hardy has been the worse math teacher i have ever does not explain the information well at all if you wanna actually pass this course do not take him he has no remorse for any student although unless your black he also does not explain th infomation well at all along to go with that he tends to mumble
3.5,M,dr hardy expects you to listen and pay attention in his class at all times he offers extra sometimes give you take home he really wants all his student to do well in his class and gives each student an opportunity to do up to the student what grade he or she will make
3.5,W,dr hardy expects you to listen and pay attention in his class at all times he offers extra sometimes give you take home he really wants all his student to do well in his class and gives each student an opportunity to do up to the student what grade he or she will make

4.0,W,dr hardy expects you to listen and pay attention in his class at all times he offers extra sometimes give you take home he really wants all his student to do well in his class and gives each student an opportunity to do up to the student what grade he or she will make
2.0,M,this class is not for beginners or for those of you returning to need to have a very good understanding of algebra to take his classes his classes are very hard if you have no understanding or are new to algebra and you must come everyday or you will fall does give chances for extra credit not take his class
1.5,M,hardy always came to class late sometime even over minutes he was always poorly prepared and we rarely covered things on the test glad i am good at math and already knew the stuff he was trying to teach because if not i would have been screwed i only needed the class for the credit
2.5,M,i got on all assignments and ended up with a c in the will not change a grade even when wrong attendance is mandatory i thought the class was extremely easy even if you work everything in on time or never miss a class he use that in your favor the final had things we never learned or talked about in class
1.0,M,dr hardy is horrible at teaching he need to improve in his teaching skills attending class everyday is a must or you will be left behind he will give you extra credit to help your grade sorta fair when he feels like it go to the tutoring lab because they will help you i recommend his class to people who have a hard time in math
2.0,M,i really stuggle at math and he made me even more aware of the fact that i have a hard time i cried everyday that i was in that class because he was so hard and i could never understand what he was teaching he does not explain the material well at all i had to withdraw it was a horrible experience
1.5,M,goes really fast and acts like you already know everything about fabric usually tests are hard he even told us before the first test that half of us would drop and he laughed also verrrry boring
3.5,M,george is a pretty good teacher gives a quiz one day a week and its only questions there are tests make sure you study the class is a joke if you study and take notes power point every day he goes kinda fast so i suggest using a computer for notes he isnt really into teaching this class hes engineering so hes pretty lenient
5.0,M,professor burge is one of the nicest and most interesting teachers that had so far at towson he is extremely interesting and his class is a piece of cake you do have to study for his tests and memorize quite a bit for the essays but other than that worth taking his class if i had the chance i would take another one of his classes
5.0,M,some instructors insist their students memorize a bunch of unimportant facts like dates or names good instructors make sure that the ideas seep in and focus on useless details jeffrey is a good instructor i feel like i genuinely learned and i feel like my perspective on ethics have made a change for the better after finishing his class
5.0,W,awsome teacher and her class is a complete waste of time as far as learning is concerned but she could tell you eveerything you need to build your schedule and complete your major and is just very passionate about sports i recommend her highly
4.0,W,i took television history and form with professor murray this semester she is a good professor very clear a bit boring at times but overall a good class grading is done in a very straight forward manner and if you go to class and do most of the you will get a good grade
3.0,W,she is a very fair grader and all assignments are fair she is also very nice and helpful it was her first time teaching amateur media she knew a lot but often her knowledge was around photography the class was kind of boring and the articles and lectures were often common sense or dull the class was more history based then i thought
1.5,M,forget tough but fair not fair and his toughness is artificial if you fail to make the arguments he wants you to make in the way he wants you to make them the grade you receive will not reflect your work
2.0,M,professor fruscione was incredibly condescending he clearly picked favorites and if he like you your grade would reflect that
4.0,M,magder is the best are far from mandatory in fact you could miss every single one and nobody would notice but helpful to attend and his lecturing is engaging the workload too much but it definitely a breeze either mc was tricky but luckily he reformatted the final quiz to only one essay
4.0,M,he reminds me of dr house expert in his field and very knowledgeable and engaging in class difficult for me though to figure out what he wants on some assignments gotten everything from a b to an a so a bit confused because i feel like i did anything different but a good professor lots of reading
1.5,M,well i dont have much to say about this guy but i will say hes a easy marker but u have to study on your own cuz he doesnt give notes or slides but its ok course if u dont know nothing about philsophy then stay away or at least away from him
1.5,M,darren hynes is a horrible prof he makes going to class useless because he just stands up front and rambles incoherently theres no notes or structure and when asked to explain something he does so by responding with something else that you cannot understnad if you have to take this course do so with a different prof
3.0,M,i found this prof great very laid back and engages the class in his discussions eager to hear students thoughts especially in the area of morals and ethics he is a fair marker and very approachable to be honest i barely made it to class but had interest in the material and came out with an in the course
1.5,M,clearly out of his element with history no notes were given used often but gave little idea of all aspects in the course term definition midterm and a cheat sheet for the final that included definition terms and essay questions his ta was the only reason i did so well in this course he was useless
2.5,W,she gives the most work out of all the other professors who teach the same course
4.0,W,i had prof sussman for intro to media criticism her classes are very interesting and she knows what talking about really easy to get a good grade in the class as long as you listen to what she has to say the tests are a lot of writing but she prepares you really well
4.0,M,professor moran is the most adorable man he is extremely helpful and down to earth follow instructions to his essays perfectly and you will get an easy a he is not looking to trick anyone just trying to get you to follow his lectures if you show up to class you might also make a letter grade difference he respects students who respect him
2.0,M,his lectures may be entertaining because he is so knowledgeable and incorporates many anecdotes but i have not had good experiences with him in person he has been extremely rude to me and i have witnessed him be rude to other students it ruined my experience to say the least
5.0,M,best bio professor ever he gives great feedback everyone should take his classes i know i will continue to take his classes
5.0,W,worked with her on contract and found her to be extremely knowledgable she opened my eyes to the atrocities happening in todays world and helped me find new ways to reach my students she is a wonderful woman and a joy to work with
4.0,M,this class was more than a book club learn a thing online blogs were a joke as a teacher he was good not the most patient gets a little frustrated when his point getting across but always means well he cares about your grade and will work with you very helpful in office hours take him in another class
4.5,M,rob burton has his flaws but grow on you his class is great he always assigns great texts leads interesting discussions and the use of informal blogs for homework is fun and engaging he can be irritable from time to time but i take it personally not such a cold fish one-on-one as he seems in class recommended
2.0,W,such a great topic with an obnoxious arrogant and hateful lady come and see the way she often embarrass people in the class she is too uptight and the course materials has nothing to do with the course itself looks like what she googled off the web i regret taking this class

5.0,M,yes john is a fun teacher and a great guy to talk to however attendance is a huge issue--not his the class he hold his students accountable for attendance in his upper level classes so a lot of times class is pointless you could attend every day and get the same grade as a person who came the first and last day
1.5,M,unbelievable left class for a dentist appointment and expected us to sit around and wait for over an hour for him to get back
4.0,W,she is nice and whenever you have a test and mess something up she will go through it with you until you get it right so hard to make a bad grade in there she likes it when you practice so be sure to do that it a hard class for me

4.5,W,she expects you to work and work hard but if you do reward your efforts not going to meet you halfway though very kind and encouraging if you seek her out for help or guidance a really super professor
4.5,M,professor bell takes the class very seriously many people get upset with him because they take it for an easy a and it is certainly not one that being said he is extremely knowledgeable and you can learn a lot in the class just put in the effort and you will do well
5.0,M,he may come off as a bit mean but really because strict clear cut and he tells his students what to expect you know exactly what grades you have in his class very organized if you get to know him better he will help you out he looks thru bs and people scraped by ask for and get it
4.5,M,if you are looking to get a quick a without any work this is definetely not the class for you this teacher is really requiring students to increase their critical thinking skills if you follow directions do well he does answer e-mails and he has provided a slew of information to assist you in doing your best excellent teacher
1.5,M,this professor is the worst professor i ever had he gets off the subject and talks about other things for over an hour he drops point on papers for the most stupidest reasons his online quizzes are all screwed up and he is definitely boring you will fall asleep please save yourself the trouble and not take any of his classes
1.0,M,this has got to be by far the worse professor ever his teaching style seriously is the worse ever seen he is not helpful yes he may be knowledgeable but he will not help you if you need it my gpa is a and i work very hard he makes it seem like this is his only class us students are taking believe me he is being reported
4.0,M,you can miss or classes a semester but by far the best part of this class is he uses the canadian grading scale a
4.0,M,janz is cute he makes terrible jokes and laughs at them which is really precious no one really talked in class no computers he writes on the chalkboard and you write down everything he says class was pretty boring tests are difficult must read textbook to do well canadian grading scale
4.5,M,he is strict and a definite pain in the butt and kind of a jerk however as long as you do what he says and get your work done then you will get really good at clarinet his teaching method is like magic
5.0,W,mb was probably the best teacher i have ever had and smc is idiotic to have let her go her classed were definitely some of the hardest read most effort necessary in my years at smc but she taught me how to become such a better writer she deeply cares how her students do do the work accept criticism and improve based on that criticism
5.0,M,excellent professor if not serious about the class then you will not do too well but as long as you follow his instructions miss more than classes and pay attention be fine if you have any problems with any moves help you out until you get it
2.5,M,ummm can some give e his email address
4.0,M,a really nice prof but definitely expects you to work and practice hard he seems to really understand level of commitment and teaches accordingly only negative point is that he say too much so you have to ask him if you want an a specific answer
3.0,W,she is very hard to understand and that puts a damper on the interest level of the class however the professor that took over for her this semester is very clear and easy to understand explains things better she is also pretty hot too
1.5,W,get me wrong ellie is probably one of the nicest and most interesting people ever had the pleasure of meeting however her lectures are confusing she provides very little structure and tends to get off topic a lot when teaching lacan chances are unless a grad student not going to get anything from this class
5.0,W,will take her class again
4.0,W,tests are hard and every single point counts only point different in an a and a b i was points from an a and she would not pump me up and i was at every single class strict but i would take her again just follow her review and study hard
5.0,M,i had dr cavaiola for classes-psychopathology marriage and family he is not easy but the best professor to take if you want to learn a lot his classes are fun and interesting and he is very professional and fair he is the epitome of what a professor should be
3.0,M,i think he needs to encourage classroom interactions within peers and teacher-student as well since the subject is psychopathology for counseling
5.0,M,he was awesome really tried to help you understand and pass the class
2.0,M,at first the class seems great humorous discussion-based but entertainment can only disguise the lack of content for so long his arrogance and sarcasm cross the line from enjoyable to inappropriate instructions are oftentimes long and confusing if you want to actually learn take harding overall an extremely frustrating experience
5.0,W,wow i cant believe people like her she is an awesome teacher and buy what people say you will learn a lot from very clear of what she teaches shes very understanding and very straight forward i had fun in her class and she is one of my favorite teachers out there
1.0,W,horrible horrible horrible once this teacher has it out for you do not ever plan on passing her class
5.0,W,best professor i have ever had period i loved coming to this class and always found myself drawn into the discussion gilson is incredibly intelligent and has a lot to share if you let her her personality is very bold but i found that to be a good thing you can rewrite anything and she is flexible so you have every opportunity to do well
5.0,W,very nice and extremely funny show for class and ask questions will give you a easy a on participation and take notes very helpful on exams buy all the book needed some of the stories are online so you can just print them and exams a pretty easy if you pay attention in class which you will cause she is so much fun
4.5,W,she is brutally honest when it comes to critiquing work so at first i was afraid she would be a hard grader i found her critiques to be helpful and her grading fair and even a little generous she is opinionated but tolerant of others opinions if you prefer the standard lecture class not the professor for you
1.0,W,too nit picky she does try humiliate you over email to the whole class she wrote on the announcements page i was pleased with all your assignments except for one student which was me that was really unnecessary gets mad when i use commas comma splice but then when i use commas its a run-on sentence like really which one is it
4.5,M,i love allard had him every semester since second year and i have learned a lot from him i think super helpful when it comes to office hours but easy to make yourself look silly in front of him great prof great lectures
5.0,M,been part of the allard fanclub since first year utterly fantastic he walks in lecture and holds the place spellbound for the next minutes he has deep knowledge and passion for his subject matter and absolutely hilarious you truly been in an english class until had allard
1.5,M,very disappointing he tries to fit too many books into the course and fails to discuss them in enough detail dont count on him taking any sort of personal interest in his students
3.5,M,you have to understand three things do not skip any of his classes he knows do all the assigned work when you think he hates you he he just wants you to do well his class is like a non-stopping train from the first minute until the last you have to be focused show him you care about your future and you will do fine
2.5,M,awful professor he is a very smart man in his field tells you everything that will be on the exam but even so the exams are incredibly difficult unfortunately i recommend taking with him so that you can get ready for his style in the questions kill as do the long problems accounting is awful with him more so
3.0,M,gives everything that will be on the exam in review but it is still really difficult he is a generous grader but not generous enough there is no curve
1.0,M,repeats himself every lecture hands out syllabus but doesnt follow it lectures off topic about world economy we havent used the text at all yet but from my understanding we will be tested on it so i suggest am supposed to be learning about investing in the stock and bond he hasnt taught us anything yet
4.0,M,had him for bus and personal finance very easy class my book was hardly used except for tests lectures very helpful for tests but he does relate rl situations through experience to things in the text often absent but i forgive him from his age one of my fav prof mainly from personality esy clas teach urself if u want to lrn any
4.5,W,fun and full of excitement you must follow directions and listen carefully in the beginning it may be easy but near the end of the semester she will give you projects with very simple and sometimes incomplete instructions but she expects you to do them and to make it perfect she will also tell you due dates only once so pay attention
4.0,W,been reading some of the other comments made about ms yearwood and i get it she is very informative and obviously a very intelligent person just because she expects you to do your make her a bad teacher
4.0,W,beth was a very good teacher she used the book a alot and there were major projects the whole semester she was a bit unorganized sometimes but very friendly and helpful if you had any questions she would do her best and very leniant at times overall if you go to class and do the work you will pass good teacher
2.5,M,this guy is just like a sales i didnt learn so much in the class take his class unless you want to waste alot of money if you do please find ways to get the textbooks for cheaper
2.0,M,i took his class and got a b i deserved an a it bothered me that once i worked at el centro i would hear him tell the faculty he never gives out because no one deserves one the only reason still teaching is good pals with the president a shame fools like him are allowed to even be employed at a college
1.5,M,this professor is not interested in giving you a true education he is interested in the extent to which he can persuade other people to reinforce his very aggressive and prejudiced political agenda do not take class if you are white female or shy you can only achieve an a grade if you agree with his views
4.5,M,very easy taken in the classroom the online class has to do much more work than the on-campus class and from what seen mr jones is not very computer savvy so if you want an easy a for humanities take his class but not online tests are open book and if you are genuinely interested in humanities mr jones has a lot to say
1.0,M,if you take his class online you must understand that he will take forever to e-mail you back you have to get the book for the work is easy and you have to read the book just skim for the answer or if you can look them up he really instruct us well i recommend
1.5,M,extremely difficult professor for a general education course requirement gives way too many readings and does not understand that we have other classes and majors his exams are too tricky do not take him if you want an a
4.0,M,im not sure if he still teaches but this guy is a incredibly smart he is a bit hard to understand but if you ask questions you will understand he is a very reasonable guy i despited a test grade and he was very nice and open minded about it and ended up changing it stay after class to help you too i wish he tough more classes
2.0,M,he just know how to teach to a room of kids he relies completely on unclear vague powerpoints and his lectures are totally centered around describing studies very boring and misleadingly difficult also the tests are built around memorization this class discouraged me from pursuing a topic that i had been very interested in
3.5,M,good prof although when he talks about all the studies it can be a real snooze the papers are short and easy his exams r easy too if you take the practice exams
5.0,W,she is super friendly and is very easy going with great lectures she is very approachable for help and the class too difficult as long as you follow her reviews for the exams she is probably my favourite professor so far so i would definitely recommend taking this class overall a great class and prof
4.5,W,tanya is one of my favorite professors at the university her lectures are interesting and she is always pleased to help students shes just a very sweet women and i would definitely recommend taking a class with her her classes are not the easiest but if you attend class and do most of the readings do great

3.0,M,very very difficult even for an honors course not impossible though a good challenge for someone looking to do well in a math career he explains well but the material can be so murky that it is still takes time to sift through gave up his own time to give us an unofficial recitation session i highly recommend him

5.0,M,hes an amazing marker u cant fail his course
4.5,M,dr kurtz is an amazing professor he is passionate about his classes and his students the content is difficult but he is always willing to help and fair
1.5,M,really obscure he is unclear and not a very good teacher he sort of throws out big words and hopes that they sound intelligent but secretly not very smart easy if you like pandering to his desire for run of the mill phrases and simplistic insights all the books are redundant and similar good luck
4.5,M,i love dr snay and his class is great my only complaint is that his assessments are incredibly picky most of the stuff you need to know will be one-liners from the book that you would probably not give a second glance to so be super careful he loves history and teaching but i think he forgets that not all of us can be walking encyclopedias
5.0,M,love him
5.0,W,a prof actress and teaches acting hello you a theatre then take her courses if you are then you must take her will get great value from her knowledge and experience she tells you from the beginning that this is not easy and it this is serious work and evdb is a great teacher

3.5,W,she is an extremely hard grader she gives out the syllabus at the beginning of the semester and sticks to it pretty well she remind you when things are due just expects you to know her classes are fun and interesting if you like acting and theatre take her class if you are not a serious actor
5.0,W,deb is awesome her projects were really tough but she inspired me to forge ahead and i changed my major from painting to id mostly because of her she is patient and easy to talk to and always has time for students on an individal basis if you get her you are lucky
4.0,W,deb was great she gave us fun assignments and was always enthusiastic sometimes her expectations were not always clear but she knows when effort is put into a project and she takes note of it the final project was a blast too just remember to make the pojects your own
1.0,W,dr jackson had an extremely arrogant attitude and when asked questions would snap she was not helpful at all and would make snide remarks that made you think twice before even asking a question do whatever you can to avoid this lady
4.0,M,he is very intellgent and passionate sometimes he rambles but that is only because he really loves what he teaches i enjoyed this class alot of work and it really made me think what school should be about no never a dull moment with this guy
4.5,M,very easy class he takes attendance but claims it does not factor into grade only right assignments in the entire class a take-home midterm and take-home final only a few pages of writing required he generally lets the class out early as well very nice and easy to talk to a great choice for a free elective easy a
4.5,M,the textbooks that he says you need are not a requirement buy or rent them you can google a lot of the info or use library resources teaching-wise very passionate and kind pretty funny too and a little eccentric which is always interesting the class is very easy movies every class really chill and intelligent easy a
5.0,M,such a kind instructor long lectures but he keeps it interesting by asking questions using photos videos sometimes recent ones and explains how it applies to you as a student he always comes to class enthusiastic and ready to teach tests can be very long but if you study each chapter and take good notes during his lectures you will pass
5.0,M,awesome teacher i really like to take his class as i am a international student many terms i understand and he just explain these terms in easy way and help me a lot but the rock part is really hard

4.5,M,chris did a great job showing you what you needed to concentrate on in the labs for the exams and what you he walked you thorugh the labs and would help you anytime you needed him to via open labs phone calls or email great guy take him when you can there were exams and a couple quizzes but he gave you study guide for all of them
5.0,M,a great teacher his first year back at vol state in a about five years he explains things as many times as you need it explained very good at explaining it and loves answering questions his test bad just study the notes and be fine he will help you out with anything you need and his pretty laid back
1.5,M,very boring he reads from his powerpoints and expects you to learn on your own pretty much he is not hard you just have to keep yourself motivated because he sure wont
1.5,M,i am in his last class before he retires be thankful you do not have to worry about him as your teacher he stay focused he goes off on things not related to this class his tests are overly in depth and he lies about what is actually on them he uses wrong solutions in the lab saying they work the same yet give different results
1.0,M,typical charles darwin believing biology teacher he is boring and his assignments are incomprehensible avoid
5.0,M,dr frank is amazing i appreciated the stories he told about using what we were learning in his medical practice his tests are difficult but his reviews are incredible learn a lot with dr frank
5.0,M,very good teacher he gives out study guides which are a little helpful with the examns but as long as you attend class you will be fine he does gives a review class that you have to attend on your own at the given time he gives but if you can go he gives tremendous hints about what is on the exam i would recommend him to anyone
4.5,M,dr frank made my science experience great he is very caring when it comes to his students yes his jokes are old and outdated but his ability to teach is great i still remember the points he made utilizing those jokes
5.0,M,is a great find it funny that all the bad ratings for have bad grammar and spelling his review if you want a b know the book for an a he is very kind and considerate
4.5,M,really helpful and if you talk to him and ask him questions he will go out of his way to help you he wants everyone to succeed his class all you have to do is ask always helpful outside of class also
3.5,M,pretty easy as long as you keep the notes he gives you set
5.0,M,there are online quizzes and lec exams online lab quizzes and lab exams a lot of info but his power points are awesome i hardly used the book mainly just used the power points there are chances for bonus points and extra credit he is very helpful and accessible i would take him for but he is not scheduled for that class
4.5,M,pretty cool guy easy to get along with i did well without the power points hand wrote the notes got an a with them talks real loud because he hear himself
5.0,M,very good teacher read over his powerpoints and you will pass all of the questions come from that he has mulitple choice fill in the blank definitions and essay questions which he gives you if you ask he also has a review study and you will do well
3.0,M,horrible unless this is the only class you are taking i dont recommend him you have to study literally everyday to maybe make a c his lab is ok but lecture is just ridiculous
5.0,M,is a great did micro with him and passed all subjects with an a very pleasent and never had a science background but i learnt a lot from to do is study well his ppt gives quizzes wait fr the last moment to u would pass with an a trust me
4.0,M,i have to re-take this class ughhhh the test are way harder than expect them to be the book isnt required because all his notes are online lots of notes wish i would have read these comments last semester
5.0,M,the readings are interesting and his lectures are very participatory he truly cares about and respects his students d sets a great example for future teachers
5.0,M,the w stands for writing-intensive it is our required coe writing-intensive course shocker a ton of work d is the best teacher in the coe passionate engaging and he makes you think the reading are all connected and you learn a ton about how to effectively teach in our diverse world one of my top classes
1.5,W,slow at returning emails slow at grading and opening tests to review rude unprofessional will not take her for anything ever again will not listen to reasoning and questions students speaks down to those who disagree with her teaching methods and avoids questions and concerns as well do not take her if you can find another to take
1.5,W,i learned a lot but when it came to tests and assignments she is overly ready to give you an f she curve even when only person passes i ended up withdrawing from this class so i could re-take it with a different professor terrible online class listen to this review and the other reviews on here wait or take another prof
4.5,M,he is not terribly hard very kind and fair in his grading i took classes this one was my favorite by far however this is college so you will have to study
4.0,M,the lecture exams cover at least chapters at a time the labs are pretty easy and straight forward he is helpful but wants you to think for the homework ask questions you can call him email or even stop by his office he will help if you ask for it a tough subject practice the math until you have it down

5.0,M,he is an awesome economics teacher i am taking another class next semester
2.5,M,his notes are not hard to follow it would be nice if his feedback was more direct than indirect in grading assignments when it comes time to take tests more frustrating to put down answers than it is about doing exams because the questions seem to be clear about what he is asking
5.0,M,best economics professor at stanislaus probably best teacher had over all took him for macro micro awesome

1.0,W,her accent makes it very hard for her students to understand her she yells when she talks so it makes it worse she always seems to be in a bad mood she gets irritated when you ask questions she also rushes you to finsh your lab i would not recommend taking her for chemistry
2.0,W,this teacher has a very thick accent creating a language barier with her studens she is easily frustrated when a student understand her i do not recommened taking organic chem with her over the summer it is a nightmare
1.0,W,i reccoment this teacher her accent makes communication difficult the first half of the semester she showed films of someone else lecturing from our book the second half she she lectured for min before busy work she yells if you understand not works with you also expects you to know material before its covered in class boo
5.0,M,i enjoyed class he was very helpful during the semester and i learned more than i thought i would
4.5,M,one of my favorite classes at vol state i took his interpersonal communication class as an elective and i loved it he keeps the subject interesting and i love his style of teaching he can be a little sarcastic every now and then but still very nice and a very good teacher i would suggest taking him to anyone
4.0,M,this guy is really cool as long as you do the assignments you will have no trouble making an a he lets you take the quizzes up to three times each and you only do speeches enjoy
3.0,M,he was cool until the end of the semester when he started giving everybody bad grades for no reason group project was terrible take this class in person if ya can

5.0,M,great teacher quizzes are from samples he gives beforehand two speeches which he gives great preparation beforehand his entire class is mapped out for you in contents and you can work ahead on some things learned loads
1.5,M,easy a if u study for instructon learn anything except from what read in the very unprepared to give speeches we spend anytime preparing he makes you go to the library to take your in you are taking a hybrid to save trips to the take him
2.0,M,a joke of a teacher i didnt appreciate him and in a classroom setting he is awful
4.5,W,she is a very sweet and helpful teacher she reads the chapter with the class for every chapter and lets you work together on most of the chapter test really not a hard class if you just read loved her would recommend to anyone
2.0,W,is not very helpful at all i do not recommend her especially if math is not your strong point
2.0,W,although she is full of knowledge professor lester allows her attitude dominate infact intimedate the majority of students who already have a hurdle to overcome in mathematics let alone having to content with an unhappy short tempered controlling condescending overworked unhappy teacher i use the word teacher lightly
5.0,W,ms lester is a great teacher math my favortie but she explains it so you can understand not a mean teacher she just take mess from students who want to learn and apply themseleves hates texting makes you get on the board sometimes but she is a wonderful instructor and will help you i would take her again
3.5,W,she was a really great teacher i am not good at math and i hate the math lab program but she taught very well
3.5,M,mr osaitile is an awesome instructor he makes everything relatable and fun his grading is kinda strict but he is fair he expects you to turn everything in on time but will give extentions is he thinks you deserve them overall i would recommend him to anyone
5.0,M,at first he appears harsh and as time goes on you will begin to understand him better he really does care about students just take the time to show you care so funny and just down to earth really big on respect more so than other teachers overall the course is clear and not too difficult at all oh and follow directions
1.0,M,if you want a nigerian english teacher who has an extremely thick accent and does not know the english language very well then sure he is not fair helpful or clear any paper you turn in is not good enough oh and he likes to yell at the class like they are unruly children do not take his class
3.0,W,weird but not hard i say that her class was interesting or i learned a lot but i can say that her class was definitely not difficult really weird but she can sometimes be interesting i think some people are judging her too hard on here
2.0,W,reynolds is weird she gives you relatively easy papers to write you write them alone and turn them in on the day they are due the only time i went to class was for the first two weeks and thereafter only to turn in my papers or have a grading conference this teacher is not for anyone who is not self motivated
2.0,W,dr reynolds was a peculiar teacher that did not really lecture much at all after the first few weeks of the semester her essays were not too difficult but she did not really help explain how to go on about writing them it felt like a self study course with class visits just to turn in the assignments i ended up with a b in the class
4.0,W,a great person and teacher she might weird you out on the first day but the first day i ended up liking her a lot allows you to manage your working time and recommend what you should have done obviously a due date for the essays typically excepts work after deadline but push it
4.5,W,judy is generally a few minutes late to class but she always gives an overview of what to expect in class that day helpful if you have questions the plays and movies are fun if you involve yourself otherwise you might drift off the essays are easy if you just sit down and do them otherwise they pile up quick super nice lady
2.5,W,no personality go to class do your work keep quiet and you will be fine when she says study study a lot of people like her but those were the people that she was mean to because they did not do their work
5.0,M,simply a wonderful professor made the class entertaining and fun by using ping-pong balls it was a journal based class so as long as you read the papers and read them not just glanced do fine take any class you can with him
4.5,M,he will tell you on the test but you need to know the answers in painful detail underestimate this class because everyone told you easy
4.5,M,great teacher he will help you outside of class take him if you can
4.5,M,fantastic professor probably the best ever had very informative and entertaining lots to read and lots of notes to take but if you do your part he will do his he no longer teaches as moving to the crim jus side of campus but if you have the chance to take a class of his you regret it
4.0,M,very interesting man with lots of things to talk about in class a good teacher but you only get grades for tests he does give extra credit sometimes but you have to attend class to get it also gives study guides for everything
4.0,M,he is a fun professor but there is a lot of reading to keep up with
4.5,M,he is probably my favorite professor on campus you have to work hard but it pays off at the end of the semester read the books there are a ton of questions from them on the exams enjoy
4.0,M,often torn on my opinion of this guy he takes a very practical historical approach to film studies which is refreshing considering how bogged down his department is in heavy theory fascinating and useful research interests but so quiet he barely seems to even be there at times he lecture so much as recite lullabies
3.0,M,charles never had i had such mixed feelings about a prof he is a very nice guy who i believe cares about his students yes he is a little awkward and stutters a bit and convey his ideas with clarity or precision but he is easygoing unless you talk and plans the course out nicely the exams are super easy multiple choice
4.5,W,shocker she actually makes you read the textbooks this does not feel so scandalous to me in fact you actually come out learning something think of her classes as a book club you read sit in a circle and muse over material most lazy students will thumb through their unread book during class to find something to say ah well
3.0,W,passionate professor the work is tedious but straight forward and not too difficult she is a good professor however certain no one made an a as her take home final was absolutely unreasonable the entire class had worked on their final together with a worth of notes collectively and all came out with low and
5.0,W,if your gonna do ant she is the teacher to go with her passion for the subject shines through her teaching making me care about the subject her teaching style grabs attention and is easily understood you will need to read guns germs and steel but because she broke it down weekly its not as painful
2.0,W,she acts nice but she likes certain students if you start to get b or b that means she just does not like you you will find a lot of people getting a or a in the course just for being a friend with her if you get into any type of argument your grades will get lower
5.0,M,great class but make sure you attand lectures and have anyone signin for you because i did it and i got into some trubles my grades when down a lot because of that overall i loved his class it was fun and i recommend everyone to take it
4.0,M,this was probably the easiest class of all four years and very fun he tries to get to know the students but really know all so you could just get a friend to sign you in and you would be marked present he definitely knows his facts so make sure your powerpoints have lots of pics of the correct places
5.0,M,very easy class just make sure you study for his tests and hand in the paper on time class is interesting he can be kind of boring though sometimes great professor
4.5,W,great teacher took three different classes with her definitely my favorite
3.0,W,good essays for mini semester classes she will tell you straight up in you face whatever you need to do and i loved that about her just take her and dedicate your time your in college for reason you will learn
1.0,W,this lecturer was not there online she marked our very first essay but then disappeared until three days to the end she then hurriedly graded our work but because she had not been there to instruct us we had made no improvements in our work only two students completed the research paper by last day of semester
4.5,W,i am still in her class now so i will rate her again once i am finished very thorough with explanations course work is not too hard but it is challenging instructor helps when needed and is very quick with responses

3.0,W,first off this teacher is very sweet and you will pass the class if you show effort she cares to help you and thats what i love about her i got a b in her class but i only recommend to take her if you dont mind reading out the book to study she does not provide any notes for you to study and her lectures tend to be boring good luck
4.5,W,this teacher i must say was confusing the studyguide had question that on the test she loves her job but always off topic overall i would rate her average cause she will help you pass if you show effort

1.5,M,boaring he never really answered any questions i had just do the online assignments on time if people stop showing up he starts giving random quizes to take attenance tests are toatlly off topic and not in the format he says they are no study guide shouldnt be a problem class if your in college you already know how to use the software anyways
2.5,M,most boring professor i have ever had he complains too much his voice is extremely monotone i never knew when assignments were due if you pay attention which is extremely hard do well on the i had to force myself to go to class do not recommend
4.5,W,very nice person and good professor extremely helpful both inside the classroom and as a counselor and she made me very interesting and fun and a great representation of me we took a lawn mower completely apart and put it back together as our semester project explaining how it worked along the way great take her if you can
4.5,W,class was interesting and she knew a lot about the subject the was very upbeat and tried to get the class to participate the papers were not hard and she gives you a rubric and went over the reqirements in class plenty of times i never had a hard time finding her in her office definitely not a blow off class so slackers beware
2.0,W,took this class during a week session because my advisor said it would be easy however there is a test page papers due on two novels-due a week apart from eachother her tests are almost impossible to get an a on because all memorization of very presice facts recommend taking her in reg semester either
5.0,M,dr baker is one of the best teachers i have had he seems interested in what he is teaching and makes it interesting to learn he is one of the best at leading and encouraging participation in class think it would be possible to take a class with him without learning something and enjoying learning it

1.0,M,i do not recommend this professor he often mumbles so it is very hard to take notes and he does not follow the book he is very disorganized and when he looses your papers he holds you accountable he is also very unreachable since he does not use his email or blackboard this class is set for the student to fail and is very stressful
1.0,M,horrible teacher avoid at all costs he writes all the exams himself so they are filled with errors you teach yourself the class and he talks about his dead dog ginger constantly and uses her in of the exam questions
1.0,W,horrible teacher avoid at all costs he writes all the exams himself so they are filled with errors you teach yourself the class and he talks about his dead dog ginger constantly and uses her in of the exam questions

1.0,M,a gpa student and i dropped this course because of that man behind the podium the most unreasonable arrogant man i may possibly have ever met overall a useless professor that takes advantage of his paycheck do not take any class he is associated with i wasted around because i read his ratings learn from my mistake
1.0,M,absolute worst professor any one in college could ever take he does absolutely nothing to help the students half of what he teaches had nothing to do with the class i actually tried to go in to his office hours to ask for help but after one question he smiled laughed and turned his back on me overall rude and the most useless profesor
1.0,M,worst professor ever had i took physics in high school and got an a taking him i thought that maybe college physics was just more difficult but i needed the physics credit so i took the class with a different prof and got an a it really is him he really be teaching anymore
1.0,M,short and simple you teach yourself physics do not have him as your teacher
5.0,M,mr olguin is an eccentric and awesome teacher he is not like most teachers that offer you a strict regiment of course load that you must adhere to and demand that you understand it in a certain way your curiosity and inquisitiveness is the limit in this class u will be rewarded for the work you do students are like sheep you must be a wolf
2.5,M,sometimes interesting lecturer but terribly scattered and disorganized he canceled many classes with no warning and no substitute pretty easy grade if you half pay attention not recommended
1.0,M,took him for business research and writing main thing i have to say is if i never see him again it will be too soon within the first week of class he insulted a student really good at telling you how wrong and stupid you are but tell you what he wants and how to fix it very particular but tell you specifics until afterwards
2.0,W,she was argumentative and often had to correct herself she also would not let students try to give other explanations or examples very frustrating
1.5,W,poor judy she really is a nice lady but nice help you understand math she reaaaally sucks at explaining anything she fills in class time with calculator work and random stories about her travels i am taking stats from her which is like a foreign language to begin with she avoids your questions too dodge her class if you can
1.0,W,please please please avoid taking a class by her if at all possible if you must take one by her get a tutor the instant you can sign up for one you will need one she is so hard to follow and answer questions very well
4.5,M,one of the wisest professors i have had at fordham class is lecture style but very engaging with presentations he gives a lot of assignments but all are extremely meaningful and worth the time if you are a comm major you have to take his class will learn so be able to connect the dots between the past present and future of all media industries
2.5,M,i had rose for the second semester in a row last semester i did alright but i found his presentations recycled for this class which was helpful he was always around for extra help and he wrote right back for emails seriously reading and homework is extensive but you only meet once a week very useful kind and funny take him if you can
5.0,M,i love prof rose if you are majoring in communication you have to take at least one class with him he gives a lot of work but learn a lot as long as you put a little effort in do well he is lightning fast with responses if you send him a paper get it back to you in like minutes insane
1.5,W,this is a course she made up herself i have honors level and above classes that are easier than this she use the book she makes you buy and the tests homework and quizzes are hard she almost constantly goes over the time were supposed to get out and then gets mad when we take this lady unless youre a geologist i guess
4.0,W,very good class clicker quizzes are useless as far as grading but it does count towards the attendance this is a great course to take if you need a science credit she gives good study guides and the online quizzes will benefit you significantly also the lab required for this class is very interesting overall the best class i had in the spring
3.0,W,it was an ok class the clicker quizzes are useless and she puts everything online so you have to show up you can tell she tries to be non-biased but she succeed she averages one attack on the bush administration per week overall an ok class just incredibly boring

2.0,W,i had her for an online class this summer and the only grades i received before the class was over were the test grades which are generated automatically she made you have the tests proctored which was just a pain she was slow at responding to e-mails too which is very important for an online class expect to know your grades
2.0,W,i took her in the may summer semester and did not receive a grade on a paper or anything until august you never know what your grade is or where you stand not to mention she asks questions on tests youve never heard talks too much about her own life and not the course material
4.0,M,amazing teacher i believe his goal is to open your eyes and teach you how to want to learn rather than making you know unimportant dates and names but rather the reason behind things be at class listen participate and enjoy

2.5,M,not an easy a get me wrong this guy is very nice but he wants you to put alot of special effort into his class that means talking to him going to his office going to library etc when you write papers your grade drops dramatically for each minute mistake for instance a misplaced comma so beware
3.5,M,mr cuevas is a decent professor if you are looking to easily pass a literature class then take him because assuming you read make an a with little effort if an english major or someone interested in literature then be disappointed teaching aside a really nice guy

2.0,M,mr cuevas is a nice guy however i did not enjoy him much as a teacher he takes way too long to grade assignments and never answered any of my emails his class will challenge you and a lot of work so if you are looking for an easy a you might want to find someone else again aside from this i cannot reiterate how nice this guy is
5.0,M,nicoletto is the best professor ever he is not as hard as everyone says so be scared of him he is very helpful as long as you care about the class and want to learn attendance is not mandatory but you have to show up to pass you need the textbook very smart and interesting man take him

3.5,M,the course itself is difficult starts off really easy but by the end of it left confused unless you already have a background in visual basic coding scripps was funny and nice class was usually pretty entertaining the only downside is that when in lab he that helpful he just kinda shows you what to do
1.5,W,online class too many essays and lots of reading essays total and she very helpful when you ask questions my main issue with online was all of the smaller forum posting requirements and due dates that are placed in various places on the website can be tricky would not recommend this online format

4.0,M,dr boucher is an excellent lecturer and is great about meeting during office hours his class only has take-home exams quizzes and a final exams are on the readings and are graded harshly the quizzes are on class notes attendance is listed in syllabus but he rarely passes around a roll sheet
5.0,M,boucher is probably one of my favorite professors i did not like the idea of modern history but he made it fun i never read the book and aside from the paper i never did any outside work and i averaged a yes he is pretty attractive also very encouraging and helpful if you need it
5.0,M,i had such a crush great guy useless course he was the only reason i went
1.5,M,this class is not hard to pass but it is hard to tolerate this man is impossible to listen to and brutal to meet with in his office you will learn some interesting material and read some good cases but be prepared to use a thesaurus in class if you want to understand him
1.5,M,disliked this professor tried extremely hard in the class and did not do so well on the final because of problems outside of the classroom and he lowered my grade to a c even though i had earned a b in the class as far as percentage wise makes you sign a contract that says he can do this awful
1.5,M,horrible teacher does not teach anything just hands out assignment sheets and gives too much time in class to work paces back and forth across frot of room talking to the wall insetad of the students even when answering a question stutters over every word and seems extremely nervous even in a small him if you get bored easliy

5.0,M,prof h afshari was extrermenly helpful vey interesting man to listen has seen and been through alot definetly learn alot in his class
1.0,M,i was really excited coming into this class but after weeks of listening to prof rambling and boasting of how amazing he is my interest in this class dropped immensely papers easy discussions useless videos awesome he likes to pick on people and argue with them and god forbid you yawn or say um only take him if necessary
5.0,M,excellent professor organized test was comprehensive if you followed along in lectures experiments were fun and assignments went along with the class he is very accessible and office hours are great he was very nice and made a point of trying to get to know name the first day of class lab reports were long but facilitated learning
5.0,M,he is blunt and tells you straight up class discussions have taught me more about life than anything else he pushes you to your limits and you will benefit from this class
3.5,M,honestly an awesome teacher especially if actually interested in english got good insight and makes class fun and interesting he comments on things like a normal person and not an uptight teacher would rather you write papers in your voice not an easy a you have to be a little into it but i would recommend him
5.0,M,expects a lot of his students and is very helpful and honest with critiques gives compliments when deserved and encourages students who make an effort to improve very fair and sensitive
3.0,M,start of the class was bad he is very into his own ideas and not the ideas of others however as the class went on i learned things and he started to listen to me and others papers are graded hard with little feedback and he is not the most helpful person with essay questions if you want to read some good stuff and learn take this professor
5.0,M,i took professor meany for compostion and rhetoric ii and although i had taken the class before i transferred into the mixup he managed to make it challenging for me in the best way possible he is a great guy and will help you as much as you need but expects your very best work pay attention and you will learn a lot
5.0,W,one of the best teachers at harding passionate about teaching and easily keeps your attention truly cares about her students and their ability to do well not only in her class but life in general
1.0,W,absolutely the worst professor ever had never knew what was expected of us in the class because she know what was going on herself spent whole semesters begging her to tell us what the assignments were so have a mark for the term then when she did assign something forget she assigned it most disorganized person ever
3.5,W,adele is a really great prof who really cares about what she is teaching and her really have to show up to class and do all the course material but the class itself is quite easy
1.5,M,on cody on the one hand i got an a but i feel like i taught myself a lot of the material from the book lots of homework very thorough and knows his stuff but he assumes his students are brain dead no-nothings and can actually be quite condescending and discouraging i know how you guys are going to do on this test
3.5,M,very thick russian accent sometimes hard to understand overall a great professor explains in detail and will gladly re-explain anything not sure on attendance is not mandatory nor is doing homework tests make up your grade and they are all open book open notes plus he usually gives a take-home test after to help boost your grade
4.0,M,does not lecture topics covered in tests pointless to come to class everyday no classes on friday paragraph research paper instead he covers the entire test a few days before class discussing and answering all the questions you can pass with a b if you just show up take notes if you miss class only point per class missed
4.5,M,he is a great professor no class on friday and hardly any work the work is easy and so are the exams i highly recommend taking a class taught by dr holcomb
4.0,M,super easy he does take attendance but told me that he only counts off one point every day you come and you do have to write the little half page papers every week but he also only counts off one point for not doing those too i think i only did two and went to class about of the time had a b
5.0,M,great professor prepared prompt interesting and fair he is to the point and business like but is very open to students and helping solve does answer emails but very quick and direct i would recommend to anyone he tries hard to make material relevant and include all of class in discussion
3.5,M,super cute and is really passionate about his courses he expects a lot out of you so if willing to put in the effort well worth taking one of his courses extremely blunt and has a fun approach to philosophy
4.0,M,he is a fantastic teacher take him
5.0,M,craig works hard at helping his students achieve thier maximum potential you will get out of it what you put into it i learned a great deal from him
4.0,M,he is really nice and class is fun however grades are just given on how he feels you did so make sure to try and show up to class not sure how hard he expects you to work but an a is very difficult to achieve
4.5,M,i think i would like this class at all but it turned out to be one of my favorites he has a good sense of humor and answered any questions clearly the homework was tough and took a lot of time but doing it made the tests easy
1.5,M,professor jeremy van antwerp spent the first minutes of each minute lecture talking about comic books and telling anecdotes he did not seem to take his responsibility as a teacher seriously he was rarely available for assistance with assigned material and was generally unhelpful in my opinion he was immature and unprofessional
2.5,W,had her for historical methods not clear about what she wants from you gives busy work and is completely obsessed with slavery i cant really stand the class but i heard shes the easiest of the historical methods teachers she completely shut down my research topic idea and barely helped me find a new one take someone else if you can
5.0,W,she is a great professor a very sweet person who is very knowledgeable i have taken her twice and have had a good experience in both of her classes work load is fair grading is fair i would recommend her anytime
4.5,W,she to hard have two read two short books for the class and although she tells you to red out of the main textbook i only did three times paper at the end of class based on document with presentation but not to bad so nice but boring and is obsessed with slavery take her if you have a moderate interest in history
3.5,M,here is the thing yes he is a hard teacher but if you want to be a manager in an entertainment industry the type and amount of work he makes you do you will probably do times more in the real world unless you want to be a secretary for the rest of your life yes busy work but it prepares you
2.0,M,ligon is just one of those teachers you want to take but have to he have any interest in whether his students really understand or not he speaks above you and looks at you like an idiot if you ask the wrong question spend a few weeks before the exam memorizing the review problems to just get by with a b
5.0,W,she is an absolutely phenomenal professor i really felt like i was taking a stimulating class with someone who is truly passionate in both her field and students in class discussions student ideas and opinions are both valid and encouraged and out of any class i took this is the one that i always wanted to go further with take her classes
5.0,W,century british literature by far the best professor had at denison she inspires you to think critically with which are extremely but essential in making you think deeply about the topic i have never devoted so much time and thought to a course in my life
3.5,W,very smart but her classes focus more on discussion than lecture in another subject that might have been helpful but in a brit lit survey class i would have preferred to hear more of what she had to say and less of my classmates opinions
2.0,W,i only occasionally knew what she wanted to talk about and her syllabus lacked focus she wanted to talk about too many different things with the result that the course lacked coherence her lectures alternate between interesting and terribly boring as she has a tendency to go off on unrelated tangents
5.0,M,dr katz is an amazing teacher he is engaging cares about his students enough to have stimulating lectures do the reading your way through discussions does not work with him he will push you and it will not be an easy a that being said you will be better for it you will learn more in class guaranteed a must take prof
5.0,M,andrew katz is a saint he is hands down greatest asset and greatest professor do yourself a favor and take one of his classes make the subject matter more interesting than you ever thought possible sometimes a nut sometimes your not cheers to you andy
5.0,M,he was an awesome teacher very clear and concise with his instruction he was intolerant of students who pay attention but it was the students fault for not paying attention i would take all of my future classes with him period
2.0,W,dr iten the best professor around you only see her at the beginning of class when she wastes the lab time you have answering questions with clickers the lab manuel is kind of hard to understand and there are many spelling and grammatical errors in it
1.5,W,this lab course is way more difficult than it needs to be she makes herself so unapproachable but be intimidated because the only way to do well is to ask a ton of questions whether you contact her or your tas
1.0,W,prof was only present at the beginning of class and did virtually nothing to help us understand the material the textbook which can only be bought from her and has no resale value literally contradicted itself and made understanding simple things impossible in addition it was ripe with simple spelling mistakes overall it was a bad class
1.0,M,my least favourite prof ever i am an earth science major and luckily i have choice in classes and will never take another class with him he is very smart but does not know how to teach you have to go to class since lecture notes online are not helpful and for a textbook it was a bunch of different books on reserve
2.0,M,he does seem nice but i think phil is a gpa booster perhaps i am not suitable for this kind of the materials were dry and if you like logic you might want to take it but in my opinion i recommend
5.0,M,amazing programming instructor able to relate programming concepts in a way that is easy for newer programmers to understand overall a very friendly guy he should quit smoking though
3.5,M,i am a garbage programmer but this guy is a very good instructor if you have the ability to learn programming easy going helpful will do half the code for you if you are struggling probably the best introductory programming instructor you could get show some effort and he will always help you
4.0,W,very easy to follow and sets assignment dates at a reasonable pace a little bit too much hand-holding although based on some other reviews i can see why she might
4.0,M,from what should be the most boring class sad doing flow charts and drawings dwayne actually manages to keep things interesting he likes to joke around and pick on people but all in good fun although he can be tough on you in class at times his class is definitely my favorite
3.5,W,a really smart prof and willing to help out but the notes she provides are worse than bad and not much to add during lectures the readings were interesting but it was hard to apply them to the paper and final i wish she relied more on her own teaching than on outside literature leaves much to be desired
5.0,W,great prof very personable teaching style and a knack for breaking down complex ideas expectations were clear and she was very approachable for clarifications also great at answering questions
3.5,W,a good professor very engaging her teaching style helps keep students interested the course could have been organized better
3.0,M,tests and bell ringers are very hard you really need to study his lectures are interesting to say the least his sex lecture if by far the lecture ever been to in my years at bu
4.0,M,doug macintyre is brilliant he is extremely intelligent and very helpful you just have to know that if you need assistance you have to ask and he will do whatever he can to help go to class although it is mostly straight from the text his little random pieces of info are interesting and helpful for remembering other processes
4.0,W,nice enough goes over a lot examples a lot of times entire class days devoted just for practice before tests the only thing i hate is that she uses wiley a lot and those darn quizzes sneakup on em early i hate teachers that are on websites to keep track grade sometimes the website was wrong
5.0,M,snider best teacher i have had at from biology to chemistry major just so i can have him as a professor not a walk in the park but his door is always open for students that need help or just want to talk and yes his take home tests will make u cry like a little girl but and he tells you that from the start
5.0,M,very very helpful it was a really tough class but he gives extra work that boosts your grade very funny and keeps class interesting i go to him for help even in my other chemistry courses i have with other teachers recommended prof just dont take the class expecting an a
2.0,M,this person is masterful at implying content to what he says and does i prefer substance seems to have a predilection towards the avant garde and is dismissive of many types of work he feels has been sufficiently represented historically although his personal work looks like lo-grade ab-ex go figure
4.5,M,let his big bad this class will kill you or i will attitude scare you at first he is a really nice guy and has had a profound impact on many many students classes not too hard just do your work and follow directions or he may eat you up for that is quite willing to work w you on things sense of humor comes across as anger its not
2.5,M,this guy answers his cell phone in class it would be one thing if it happened once but it happens almost every day total disrespect for a graduate class
5.0,M,class is one of the best classes i have ever taken--certainly one of the funniest to do well on the quizzes you have to do the reading but the tests are usually pretty easy he makes lectures and silent cinema fun and exciting smart and funny
5.0,M,make jokes at himself and others one of the best guys ever met he infuses a love of cinema in you
4.5,M,really passionate and his enthusiasm is contagious has a tendency to go off on tangents and on tangents of tangents but always gives the class an offbeat positive atmosphere i may have more of his personal quotes written down than actual notes but his teaching style is so engaging that abstract concepts become much easier to grasp
4.0,M,as someone who has awful add and no interest in movies i still looked forward to coming to class every day the material is easy enough to grasp although he tests directly on readings that are never discussed in class still todd is always good for a few laughs
5.0,M,i love todd i thoroughly enjoy attending his class he makes it extremely entertaining
1.5,M,very self-centered very egotistical hard to understand does not care whether you get the material or not has a god complex so get on his bad side do not recommend
1.0,M,the son of god as he once referred to himself in class is probably without a doubt the worst teacher i have ever had it would also be nice if i could understand half of what he said which makes an already hard class even harder be happier to be done with his class
4.5,M,paciocco presented the material in clean fashion sometimes he jumped around especially during the winter term but his lectures are inspiring and amazingly knowledgeable if you want to learn criminal law the right way paciocco is your man just be prepared for rigorous fact pattern exams
5.0,W,i took professor jackson-jones in she is an outstanding instructor the skills that she has bestowed upon me has helped me with term papers essay etc i am so thankful for her
4.5,W,i love her we get along great she is a wonderful teacher
5.0,W,i love her have learned a lot
1.5,M,he does not explain or review found myself looking on the computer for help take another prof quick
4.5,M,use power point slides has a good sense of humor if you read the chapters and understand the topic and go through the audio clips that he provides on blackboard it an easy pass just give in the effort to read and understand the topic and you do extremely well on his test
4.5,W,kind of annoying with the way she teaches and assigns a little juvenile but you come out of it really knowing the material and she really does want to help you
5.0,W,dr e is absolutely one of the best professors on campus she knows more about spanish than any professors had and does her absolute best to help you learn everything you can she integrates the language with the cultural experience and encourages students to expand their world and to have fun while doing so
4.5,M,he gives you all of the notes in a coursepack at the start of the semester and attendence required but he will bump up your grade if there frequently enough for him to recognize your name the tests come directly from the study guides he gives you and all of the answers are in the course pack very good prof and easy class
4.0,M,you must attend class or you will miss something you need to know for the test he just talks at you the entire time try to keep up with notes and start studying days in advance for the test use the study guide very helpful if i were you id get a different teacher
1.0,M,he had terrible handwriting organized and skipped around in lectures his tests were awful even though he had a study guide half of it on the test and you had no idea what to expect he was always late to class and just not good
1.0,W,this is by far the worst teacher i have ever taken the only advice i can give is do not take this lady she asks questions in one way and grades how she wants she asks an opinion question and wants your answers backed up with research
1.5,W,what i understand is how she is the chair of the department and still be the worst professor students have been saying she is horrible for years and she still has her job i understand that i guess the college and division care how bad she is at teaching someone else should be evaluating her besides her dept
1.0,W,she is the worst teacher i have ever had everything people say on here is true i wish i would have never taken her class
3.0,W,lectures are interesting but she can be very close-minded you need to go to class every day no exceptions miss too much grading for papers is mostly fair but can be fairly arbitrary at times the tests are multiple choice but with short answer type questions which makes them tricky and sometimes potentially wrong
4.5,W,awesome professor intelligent lively funny enthusiastic do the readings or you will be screwed at the end of the semester be active in class ask questions if you need help a hard grader and her tests are tough if you pay attention in class and do assignments be fine one of my fave classes at iu
3.5,W,have to do readings every time they are assigned on tests she is so specific if you dont say what shes looking for its wrong have to work veryyy hard
5.0,W,wonderful techer she makes learning fun i wish she taught all of the education classes at cal she truly loves teaching and will remind you every day why you are in school for education wonderful wonderful lady

4.5,M,i had fogel back in the mid and he sounds like still the same guy funny encouraging remarkably insightful and sparks insights into lit that i never had from any other prof before or since run walk to be in one of his classes
5.0,M,i took frank for mrk very knowledgeable about his field of work and can provide real life examples of marketing and sales theory in practice he marks pretty leniently if you do the work you will get a good grade he makes himself available via email or office hours if you have him as an option for any course hesitate take him
4.5,M,jerry is an excellent professor i have had fairly poor experience with math instructors here at western but jerry made the class very enjoyable he is a great man and cares about each student he learns name and tries to get to know you personally take a class with jerry you regret it
4.5,M,he is unlike any other math professor this class had many challenging concepts but he was always insistent on making it fun ie to learn about hyperbolic geometry he brought in pringles he learns your name quickly and is always very personable if you have to take a hard math class take it from him
5.0,M,arlan is probably the greates prof ever super funny super enthusiastic you learn alot while having fun super smart guy who wants you to do well take his class over anyone
5.0,M,hands down the best teacher ever had he genuinely wants every one of his students to succeed and will work with you to help you achieve your goals arlan easy on you but in the way that he let you get away with doing less than he knows capable of if you can ever take a class with arlan do it
4.5,M,although i really interested in the subject matter itself arlan is an amazing prof funny energetic and really made an otherwise boring night-class bearable if ever interested in anything that has to do with music and technology arlan is your man highly recommended oh and his assignments are easy as well p
5.0,W,dr mirabella is the best she is a totally awesome person and really sweet not to mention funny she is a really excellent teacher
5.0,W,she is the absolute best teacher ever i love her really funny to the best dr mirabella
3.0,W,i think she was gender-discriminate but rather had favorites class was fine though she was extremely critical best advice--take her lower levels first to get some favoritism before this class otherwise its an uphill battle from the start
5.0,W,easy class the midterm is the hardest part and she or her assistant give you all the answers the class before i also took her for human relations amusing and a great person easy pass or a
3.5,M,a great professor but getting an a is rare if interested in history and do well in it i recommend taking him he lectures well and boring but if you hate history and just trying to get by your gen ed his grading will affect your gpa he grade unfairly he just grades hard a difference
1.0,M,horrible professor forgets what he is about to say extremely hard expects you to remember every single detail do not take history with him
2.5,M,gpa terminator want to find out what that means sign up for his class
1.5,M,he will waste your time or lower your gpa avoid this teacher do not take
1.0,M,probably knowledgeable about econ but really bad at teaching it his lectures are not organized at all so the main idea is usually lost on avoid him if you can

5.0,W,difficult but she cares about her students if they care incredibly clear and well-spoken and been to her house for dinner and an excellent cook
4.0,W,excellent lecturer but i did sometimes fell a little lost the readings are only moderately hard but i recommend doing them if you want to get anything out of the class plus there is not too much grading was fair and she is incredible at office hours
3.5,M,i took him for intro to drama it was an easy class he does require you attend his class as well as two of the theatre productions and write a report over them but it difficult sometimes the plays are fun to watch overall i think the class was easy
4.0,M,a great man very funny but he does not care about political correctness which makes for interesting classes will assume that all students of asian descent chinese very wise knows extensively what he is talking about homework is intense and necessary papers take a long time to do overall a great professor

2.5,W,i did not like her so much as a teacher first day of class she told us that some of is will not be passing very hard grader and critical if you do not participate in class you will not get a good grade also hates disney movies i tried to talk discuss that and got shot down especially lion king
2.0,W,she is beyond awful she teaches the class in such a way that no matter what you say she will try to say wrong and when you ask her a question she will not reply with a straight answer she always replies with another question not very helpful unless you meet one on one and still not much more helpful
2.5,W,it is super hard to understand what she wants from you she is a nice woman though very tough

5.0,M,although i got a c in the class i must say he was a remarkable teacher nice helpful intuitive and efficient more professors should be like murdico

5.0,M,i had classes with him intro abnormal awesome really friendly encourages questions always happy to explain questions even during tests funny and makes class interesting he totally made me want to major in psychology i suggest attending every class because he sometimes has pop super easy take murdico
4.0,M,his class is pretty simple but if you want to get an a in the class you really have to try you have to read the assignments assigned because he gives daily online quizes visit him during office hours and help you with writing your papers
4.0,M,well i make chambers sound as easy as the previous person but doing good in his class is completely possible made an a on both tests and final i read all the the probs at the end of the chapters going to class is a must i never missed a single class and had great notes to constantly review it

4.0,W,no need to buy the book tests and quizzes are mostly matching and she gives you extra credit for drawing pictures on the sides of your exams she automatically gave all of us on our first essay assignment as long as we handed it in-even the people who handed it in after the one week grace period which applies to all of her assignments
4.0,M,buddy likes his flow charts those working for you at the lc there dave
2.5,M,nice guy but not a good instructor he is boring and has nothing interesting to say he is also an extremely difficult grader
5.0,M,an outstanding veteran of college professors professor philo class was very thought-provoking as well as interesting even when i had little to no interest in the subject prior to signing up the reading is supplementary as noted so take thorough notes when you take his class
4.0,M,great teacher really challenges your mind and point of thought funny guy as well critelli made class amusing and lectured in a way that kept his students interested the material is complicated but he is always willing to re explain if you dont understand i would definitely recommend him
5.0,W,kim is excellent and makes zumba lots of fun but it would be good if she would turn the volume down loud music is bad for our hearing and hers
5.0,W,kim fujii is by far the best yoga instructor especially if new to yoga she makes it fun peaceful and i guarentee feel the difference after her class
5.0,W,loved this class kim is great she is super friendly and really good at explaining things this was a great introduction to kinesiology which helps if taking any other anatomy classes

1.0,M,where i do begin this guy i think he is old and senial personally what he so called teaches in class makes no sense and he has these long random pauses in between thoughts he even explained a problem in a foreign language during an exam and looked at us like we had the problem only benefit is open everything for exams

4.5,M,amazing professor his expertise within the subject matter is beyond this world he lectures only for hrs and the rest of the hour lecture he allows for group work his teaching method is nothing that you will expect but even though he relies on a lot of independent studying and research it pays off this method is very effective

3.0,W,i definitely agree about her voice it was like nails on chalkboard to me a nice lady but you can tell she astronomy so much that her social skills took a back seat she would ramble on and on about the easiest topic leaving us to figure out the harder stuff ourselves she nit-picks to the smallest detail on the homework
5.0,W,i took this class because i was looking for an easy a and it was all that was left to enroll the class work is difficult but if you ask for help she does and makes it so darn easy once she even gave me a interest in the planets that im always staring in the sky saying oh this is what she was talking liked her

5.0,M,the best prof at york just read his notes and you will definately do well
3.0,M,alright prof classes were rather monotonous since a slide reader all important info is on the slides make sure you copy the slides in class as much as possible since some info is missing or different on the slides he provides online are useless and have unrealistic expectations but prof is willing to help with any issues
3.0,W,if you are going to take this class be sure to rely on your book professor shea is not always clear but she is willing to help you in office hours

2.5,M,i can recommend him if you just want to pass but if you need to get a and you are not good at speaking in front of ppl i recommend him he is tolerant to pass but intolerant to give a he is always smiley and looks easy-going but the professor who needs result not process overall i like him but i regret i took his class
5.0,M,where else can you find a teacher like him he is the best professor i never had before please chose him as your professor he is the best i guarantee

4.5,W,great teacher not very good at math and the material was challenging lectures go kinda fast but she always offers her time to help go to class because she gives daily points for being there and it really helps to go once a week she holds an optional hour long study session which really helps with test and quizzes

3.0,M,intermediate russian is definitely challenging he expects a lot from his students and the pace is pretty quick you do most of the learning from the textbook go over assigned work in class to clarify class is almost all in russian requires a lot of studying effort homework every night class participation
4.0,M,classes are tough he expects a lot from his students but is very knowledgeable about all things russian he gives you all you need to know in lecture so take a lot of notes do the readings to participate of your grade tests are a crap shoot of what will be there but if you attend class take good notes study you can do well

1.5,W,feth was the absolute worst professor i have ever come across at cscc she is boring rude and has a dry sense of humor bother asking questions because she refuses to answer anything her tests are insanely hard her notes rarely ever help with understanding the material my advice is drop feth instantly if you see her as your instructor
5.0,M,great really make sure you understand you if u have him as a professor
2.0,M,i could not seem to get an a with this guy on any of my papers i think its because i went against all of his personal beliefs he is kind of creepy and you will not be able to stay awake during his class bother studying for the quizzes because he tries to trick you anyways i never did open the book and i ended up with a b
3.5,M,prof was great he was interesting and funny the lectures went quickly he spoke quickly so keeping us was important but the class itself was fairly straightforward wish he retired now
1.0,M,one of the most arrogant professors i have ever had some of the most confusing lectures i have ever had was with him apathetic towards his students he is now retired
3.5,M,a fantastic history prof who approaches his lecture with a bit of a sense of humour
1.5,W,she seems very nervous when reading her notes word for word theres long awkward pauses she just really needs to learn how to how to read to us she giggles randomly which gets very annoying she only wants you to memorize info someone please help her the world doesnt revolve around just healthcare airplanes need to learn
4.0,W,workload was above average class time was a lot of lecture too much time spent on weekly group presentations dr mcfadden really wants students to get it and she is very very passionate about quality lot of memorization not an easy grader but if you put in the effort you will get the a textbook needed for hw could share
1.5,M,he honestly care about the opinions tell you that on day one if you disagree with him wrong he has this habit of looking around with closed eyes and then when he asks a question to stare at you incessantly he grades like an english teacher not been reprimanded by the school before the subject tho

4.0,W,her somewhat boring complex lectures are absolutely necessary if you ever hope to get a grip on the material the course is harder than most work hard on the first essay
3.5,W,great professor as knowledge goes but she is uptight and takes the fun out of the course this course is harder than political science just so you know
5.0,M,he was probably one of the best teachers had so far he was clear and enthusiastic however i heard from a professor that he had passed away a couple of weeks ago which i sadly confirmed through an online news article on that said he had passed on he will be dearly missed
5.0,M,great teacher very clear and straightforward he is very organized and answers question very nicely the tests are stuff that are covered in so just go to all the class sessions discussions and do the homework and be fine speaking of which the homework is not too difficult like it was in eecs with lin
1.0,W,this professor is horrible i spoke minimal spanish prior to this professor has ruined the language for me she explain things well and she expects you to be fluent she gets mad when you understand something friendly but not a good teacher for an intro class expects you to be fluent by the first week

5.0,M,best prof ever he is awesome and he will always help you his quizzes are easy just watch the news looks like he gets his news from cnn msnbc and some local stuff he will always make class fun
1.5,W,she is very difficult to understand and i think she understands the questions you ask either because she very rarely answers them correctly if you understand the subject you will be fine she scales all of the tests and drops the lowest one excluding the final very easy class but she is an irritating teacher

4.5,M,i took kojo class close to years ago and to this day he stands out as one of the most influential professors in my academic career i wish i had taken his advice and gone on for forensic anthropology at columbia he always made himself available for questions after class im not sure where the other comments are coming from

5.0,M,never had a a professor that opened my eyes and my mind like eli amdur did he invented this course and the century leader and the most useful inspiring and fun course i ever took his approach is so inclusive and engaging and he is a world of knowledge and wisdom i see the whole world differently now

4.5,M,zorn is such an intriguing and intelligent guy but the man is a little crazy high standards on the essays basis for your entire grade but his dedication to helping your writing progress is just unmatched difficult grader but really engaging discussion overall an incredibly helpful character who is amazing at what he does
3.0,M,i really liked zorn and found him funny he talks a lot about how he used to teach at a black college or high black population college or something i was very surprised to find that my grades on his papers which were getting increasingly better while i mocked conservative rhetoric and style went bad as soon as i challenged neocon thinking
4.5,M,zorn is one of my favorites wacky in all the right ways that makes coming to class worth your while the reading is manageable but the papers can be challenging and he grades pretty hard all in the name to make you a better writer but always there for help i learned a lot in his classes and that is money well spent here at scu
1.0,W,dr fressola is a cold vile human being who spews venom from her mouth on a regular basis not sure why bcc or any hospital continues to keep her on the gets her rocks off of making students cry you will not learn anything if you have her except how to be afraid good luck
2.0,W,does not answer any questions she feel like answering shows disdain and contempt for students test is crazy-stuff you probably know unless already a nurse if you have her for clinicals be prepared to cry
2.0,W,school is for learning and she makes it a horrible experience yells at you humilates you and makes you feel unconfident for no reason she said that she became a nurse for the money and it shows beacause she has no compassion at all i left the school due to the way she treated me and the lack of professionalism she displayed it was pure abuse
1.5,W,had this prof last fall she is an excellent lecturer however evil in clinicals does not care about her students read every nclex book you can to study most people fail test get upset over it just ace test or else operating on a deficit good luck
3.0,W,did not have her for clinicals as an educator she often stresses points that will not be on exams her exam is very difficult not the material but the wording of the questions and a lot of nclex and you will be fine try not to take her clinical group wednesdays
2.5,W,for the first weeks of class i wondered why read so many negative comments about fres however after that point she showed her true colors she was frequently aggressive and argumentative when students asked questions rather than help in cliinical she demeaned everyone unprofessional all around i got a b but give her an f for attitude
2.5,M,very boring liked to hear himself talk took attendance but assignments were easy and he was well organized

5.0,M,took as a summer class very very intelligent professor never learned so much from a week level class grading is very fair and you know he wants everyone to do well def take this class with this professor
3.5,M,attendance was so low for every class and fellow students constantly brought computers to surf facebook during lectures gordon could have made the classes dry and unbearable but he really made them fun as long as you study what he goes over on the exam review the tests are simple you have to do some simple research on your own sometimes
4.0,M,prof travisano is great he really makes class interesting he is paramount when it comes to the subject matter and he has great life experiences to match i think he is truely unique and wish he taught more courses in sociology he is brillant and down to earth which makes him exceptional
3.0,M,everyone needs a break and that where travisano comes in place hilarious well respected by other staff because taught at uri for so long he can teach how he wants too nobody should be complaining about him because those who are are the same ones who are so happy to get an a him
1.0,M,awful so ashamed i attend a university that allows this man to teach and waste salary on his schtick is being wacky and telling stories but this is ridiculous to be listening to in a classroom setting avoid at all costs

1.5,M,joshi is a rude man with a huge ego i can understand issue isnt his speech half of what he says is to the class he messed up my gpa and cares little about students while writing a important paper he used my laptop to answer a question he then told me to turn it off because i was distracting the class do not take

2.0,M,talks about everything buy geography give me credit for quizes and a test he forgot
4.0,M,this class is ridiculously hard with that in mind he tries to make it understandable the accent makes class worth going to a fun guy the homeworks and tests are completely brutal though
5.0,W,ms berasi was a very excellent teacher i brought in a dog for one of my speeches on teen depression she allows students to think with an open mind and i loved that overall have to do three speeches and bring in a poster board for each one it was not a hard class but time consuming
2.5,W,she deffinately has her favorites and makes that clear seen people do terrible on speeches and still get better grades then me just depends on what mood shes in spend the whole class pleasing to her wants and not actually learning the class is passable you just gota put up with her ranting and insanity

5.0,W,dr lenczewski is one of my favorite professors she gives power point lectures in class that are fun and very easy to understand exams with an optional final online quizes which are easy grade boosters and watch a lot of movies with easy reviews as well she keeps class super interesting and has lots of extra credit opportunities
1.0,W,worst professor i ever had she clearly needs to re-think her teaching methods but she wont because she is stubborn iftode if you are reading this consider your rating compared to other professors on this site and re-think your teaching methods because they work
2.0,W,not helpful tough grader on papers tests are impossible test your knowlede if your good at bs-ing you will do decent on exams if you contest her she will put you down her best friend and your worst nightmare is blackboard
1.0,W,i recommend her to anyone she helpful at all when you have questions plus she is very hard to understand
1.0,W,expects you to know material just because she posted it on blackboard her teaching style consists of rambling in front of the class in a manor that is too difficult to take notes she provides no review whatsoever for tests she expects you to magically know what she wants you will be forced to learn all material yourself tests are impossible
1.0,W,she missed half of the semester and expected us to continue on like nothing happened no one not even our subs knew what was going on and when you ask questions she tells you to check blackboard even if the question you cant be answered over the computer its probably because she cant explain it to you her blackboard is soooooooooo unorganized
1.5,W,missed a large portion of our class be bad but notify us twice and the other times had different substitutes expected us to continue work incl labs without missing a beat and frequently told us just check blackboard when ask her about assignments everything i learned from her i could have learned by reading wikipedia
2.0,W,iftode is a good teacher as long as you have some sort of background in genetics if you have a solid background i would recommend taking this class if not go elsewhere her blackboard is confusing and due dates are never really clear she is really nice and when you ask her for help she is very helpful
1.0,W,a nice lady and all but seriously cannot teach for anything she is bad at clarifying things her blackboard is all jumbled up and confusing and does not tell you what is due until the day of if you want to be stressed and bored definitely take her class i advise not taking the class
5.0,M,truley one of the best if not the best professor ever had absolutely brilliant no matter what teaching you he will find a way to relate it to your every day life so that it makes sense i recommend him to everyone
4.5,W,her exams were so you pay attention and study the review sheets she gives you for every chapter you are set she is very informative and as a prior poster recommended be fooled by her hard demeanor early on she will tell you that she is not your friend and expects to be respected as a professor if you have valid reasons for m
5.0,M,dr sumner is a great teacher i have an aversion and mental disability to intro to statistic was so easy with him he jokes to make you feel more comfortable and always there if you need a help definitely recommended gotta love this guy

5.0,W,i love this professor she is awesome definitly take her
4.0,W,dr white is scary and can be rude she knows what she is talking about but intimidated me to death wants people to join in the discussion and will call you out in front of the class if you made a mistake i did learn a lot but would have rather had a different professor if you have to take her you will be fine i got a b for the course
4.5,W,i took spanish like years ago glad i chose to take prof campos she is so sweet and helpful and tries to make everything as simple as possible she consistently says this is too hard about examples in the book and simplifies them so the class can understand i will probably get a b in this class and years ago i made a d in spn
4.5,W,she is the most boring teacher i never had god
4.0,M,i love jc obvious that he loves what he does and is always really excited about it i know sometimes it seems that he wants to implement his ideas on the students but he really does know what talking about he really wants his students to do well and always there fore support and guidance i find him hilarious he does too
4.5,M,at the lower levels form and space jc was confusing and frustrating to have as a teacher however i found him to be a great guy and an even better professor when he is teaching a smaller and more advanced class although boring at times he teaches technical aspects to sculpture that cannot be matched if you do the work you will be rewarded
1.0,M,a really arrogent person thinks he knows it all not interested in helping students only interested in keeping his time with you to a minimum
5.0,W,one of my favorite teachers she is fun to be in class with and is very helpful with all the questions i would defintely have her as a teacher again
5.0,W,i had fun in her class and suprisingly enjoy the essay part make sure you stay on schedule with the essays because they can be overwhelming if you become behind her personality is very interesting she can be a little airheaded at times and just laugh at her jokes as if they are actually funny
5.0,W,dr baylard is the coolest teacher ever really understanding and answers all your questions very promptly she is also very easy going about attendence and class behavior but you sleep here hilarious even lets you turn in paper weeks late some grade her down on showing up but had unavoidable family health problems
2.0,W,this teacher is not effective i graduated with a computer science degree from denison and work in the industry now she had no grasp of the material and if she did was not able to convey it clearly when she retires i will begin donating money to denison
1.0,W,she is not helpful
2.0,W,all she does is stand in front of a computer moniter and reads off the class is not interesting
4.0,W,i had ms hampton this past spring and i must say it was quite a challenge i can see why people may say that she really interact as much with the students during on the other hand i have to say that she is extremely smart she definitely knows her info i received an a but it did not come easy overall she was a fairly desce
3.0,M,very intelligent guy but has trouble teaching it to others he got off topic easily we used three books that seem to be above what students can comprehend students really have to think to connect what the books are saying to web design hated the tufte book exams are pretty easy if you have the slightest idea what talking about
4.5,W,okay true this was a very demanding class she gives a lot work for you to complished in the semester i felt very overwhelmed sometimes but she is truly just trying to teach us a lot of material in one semester she is a very nice lady and keeps you on your toes in class im glad i took her but i am also glad that i never have to take her again
1.5,W,teague sucks made me feel uncomfortable in every single class and there were days i wouldnt even go i couldnt put up with her forces you to participate treats u like a grader papers are grammer and citations not material study guides did not help at all very vague thinks all students have memorized every word from text avoid teague
3.0,W,very hard grader especially on papers and she can be very sarcastic if you do the ids then you will do well on the tests
2.0,W,definitely too much work for such a simple class she feels everyone is taking this class because tehy are interested in it not because its a requirement her study guides are pretty vague but somewhat papers are about grammer and citation not content the presentations also pose a problem since she gives no direction on them
4.0,W,homework is mostly gave tests plus the final also papers and you could rewrite the first one and two presentations tests were not that hard she scaled both test the papers are the most difficult but not the worst class in the world i would really rewrite the first paper if you get a or lower worth it
1.0,M,he is great for none science majors who want to learn some science but if you are a science major i would suggest you find a different professor he spends the whole class talking about his idea of science but he actually teach it when he does he dumbs it down to an insulting level
4.5,M,my favorite professor i recommend him without reservations
4.5,M,i took all three of his classes they are pretty difficult however he is very helpful and will even help you with the questions during the test sometimes gives answers i would recomend him to anyone
2.5,M,it was my favorite subject i never skipped a single class read notes and textbook did my assignments and always visited his office the only patterned grade i got throughout the semester was c if i do all of the above i wonder if i would end up with anything higher sometimes hard to understand what exactly he wants from you
1.5,M,i had him last year he my favorite for sure i find his class boring he was mostly his class i was confused to want he talking about although i did read the me he lack a lot to be a professor but my opinion
4.5,M,i became addicted to this class subjects of discussions are very interesting a few written assignments most of the grade depends on your performance on the mid-term and final about each and two essays he is very nice toward his students and will take in consideration your effort and dedication to his class so your final grade raises
4.5,M,i have never thought of sociology as of subject of my interest since i started attending his class it seemed that this semester flew in one second bottom line class is awesome written assignments hard at all rather intriguing and challenging in a positive way it is not likely that you regret if you take it
5.0,M,great teacher very helpful and very determined to help you pass expecially if your math background is not strong he sticks by his office hours so visit him whenever you have a question he has an easy-going kind of character word to the wise make sure to brush up on your trig because your going to need it
3.0,M,very enthusiastic about teaching however he doesnt allow the use of for any of his exams
5.0,M,easy teacher great to work with if you do the homework class will be easy take it from me im a c person in math in calculus i have a a take him he is worth it

3.0,M,professor delamater is great he is very tough but he makes you work hard and you learn a lot this is not an easy a class but if you think you are smart enough to read a book you will have no problems
2.0,M,lectures are boring and information is unclear he is very unprofessional and treats you like an idiot if you are not understanding the info he plays favorites and ignores the students who have difficulty in class
4.0,M,professors need to have a lot of knowledge and know how to teach and kozbelt is very good with both for psy quiz every week helps keep things fresh for the tests just take good notes listen to how he outlines to course and read the textbook hes really smart and a good teacher
4.0,M,he obviously knows his stuff but his teaching methods really help either only theory without showing how to apply to any problem or he gives an example problem with a solution method that only works on that problem i found that going to tutoring was a better way to learn the material i would recommend him over some other teachers
5.0,M,loparo is a great guy and a great professor he talks and writes clearly and tells you what you need to know easily one of the best professors at cwru tests and projects are difficult but he does curve the class oh yeah he gives extra credit for the browns winning and for going to class
1.0,M,this is the worst class ever taken at cornell hirschl hates economics as a consequently economics majors like myself and is the most boring lecturer ever even the books he chose were biased perrucci and wysong thought was a conspiracy to distract the masses from social inequality i got an a but learn much
5.0,M,i am an applied engineering physics major and i had a until i took had to pull all-nighters every other day to keep up with the class ruined my more importantly my triple integrals he puts on the exam are ridiculously hard to a graphing calculator to the some extra batteries just in case
4.5,M,this guy is amazing but if you become his friend his class will become even more amazing and he will fascinate you to no end he is a great person who knows a lot and is willing to share but only if he likes you and you get to know him so get to know him and it will be a great experience class was pretty easy not about the grade with him
4.0,M,he really wants us to be educated and goes out of his way enormously to help his students a great professor and a great advisor funny too take his class
4.5,M,sweetest class ever a mad nice teacher you get to redo every paper he grades if you choose only way to loose ur grade is if you attendance mandatory but you should go if you want an a and not a class in a weird well worth time
4.5,W,swiss-educated background challenges the dominant cca graphic design philosophy that been perpetuated by groupthink students who embrace her method of teaching typography will benefit tremendously from a pedagogy that is rarely found on the west coast and enriches otherwise one-note graphic design curriculum we are lucky to have her
3.0,W,this instructor is slightly insane but i think in a good way you will have so much homework you want to die but she is fair about giving extensions and cares deeply about teaching and the subject matter you will learn a lot
5.0,W,great prof energetic and imaginative i think she could make any lecture bearable if not outright enjoyable
4.5,W,hard grader but her comments are very helpful very friendly and approachable lots of reading and critical analysis of the text took the class during summer and had to write papers no midterms and a fairly difficult final lots of in-class writing i would recommend her if you want to improve your writing and analysis skills
3.5,M,i took him for speech and we wrote like or speeches all tests are from the book he grades real hard and if you have a heavy schedule take him he gives out lots of work
2.5,M,he was not an easy teacher but i still pulled an a you have to practice practice for your speeches tests are all open book so that was nice final was an essay
5.0,W,great teacher if you go to class and take notes she outlines the assignments extremely clearly to make them easy to write dont really need the book if you have an a at the end of the class you need to take the final

5.0,M,chris is a super nice guy and a great teacher he is really fun but still wants you to learn at the same time i would reccommend him to anyone
3.5,M,i think he was a great teacher he was arrogant and some say gay i had a crush on i have no idea
3.5,M,he doesnt use blackboard or powerpoints and is pretty hard to follow while taking notes you kinda have to adapt to his style
3.5,M,he is hard to hear so sit in front willing to help you outside of class if you understand fair multiple choice tests grades on a curve lets you use one page of notes for test hey guys this is accounting expect it to be fun
5.0,M,daniel is an amazing man and a brilliant teacher he is the only uvic visual arts teacher who is not conceited anybody who dislikes him is bitter because he challenged them into understanding themselves he is always available for extra help and goes far out of his way to do so you must take his class if you care at all about learning
1.0,M,helpful at all during lab he was gone from the classroom most of the time if you need extra help during labs i suggest him i was glad that the class was finally over
1.0,W,this is one of the worst professors in devry she know how to teach and she is not fair when it comes to grading very bad and inconsiderate i think she qualify to be teaching at all all she talks about in class is her personal problems take this professor for the class
5.0,W,best professor ever you can tell she is incredibly passionate about teaching and really wants her students to learn the material incredibly friendly and very approachable and when i had questions outside of class she was more than willing to help take this professor
4.5,W,she rocks
5.0,W,very good teacher you be bored in class she makes learning fun and easy
5.0,W,great person with genuine interest in her students no nonsense which is defiantly needed at a place like devry also wicked booty no matter what age

1.5,W,honestly in the beginning she seemed like a nice woman but upon further discovery she was very cold didnt really answer questions thoroughly always believed she was correct not a really exciting class at all
1.5,M,try to avoid taking this professor yes college is supposed to be challenging his grading system is ridiculously hard and unconsistent he is not an understanding professor and his methods of teaching should really change he needs to learn how to be a good professor be prepared to take a test every week in his class
1.0,M,he was a bad teacher mad us feel like we where in grade he is useless he makes fun of you when you screw up during a speech
3.0,M,if you want santa to give you a lesson take this class one of the toughest classes taken at uci only because you have to do lots of work outside of class he talks to us like we know the material because its trivial to him there is a lot to memorize powerpoints and study guide are useless just record lecture go to class study hard
1.0,M,test was easy but lot to learn though and he seems to do all he can to make learning hard ppt are slides each blank deleted book figures the rest are outlines ditto for study guide loves to make new names for things and teaching things not in book ie he puts z membrane on the study w no explaination turned out to be z-line
4.5,M,my favorite professor so far you have to read but you will learn more in this class than anything you have taken at bentley this is not a class that you take as a fluff course though he expects you to work hard and his tests show that expectation
2.5,M,no labs and no assignments which makes learning linux challenging keeping good notes is imperative as he imparts all of his knowledge to you via lecture this is an advanced class and you are on your own for developing hands-on practice strategies and methods i did learn a lot though
4.5,M,he was a great math teacher and his enthusiasm for math really showed i woils warn future students his accent makes him hard to understand it took me about two weeks to be able to understand him
5.0,M,honestly i am appalling at this professor is great and makes the class really fun he is really helpful and understanding and is prepared to take time to go through the problems and help you get the highest grade you can
5.0,M,mr qureshi is very clear and precise he clearly enjoys math and really wants to help you understand and love it too extremely funny and playful when it comes to numbers unless you come to class and care about getting a good grade you should get an a
3.5,M,honestly i need sometime to understand what he said because he got pretty strong accent but it a problem to listen later on most of the test are mc and even final the questions are straight forward what u need to do is just keep up with his though he did not really check then u would not have any problem in class
3.0,W,i agree with the above comment that this class teach you anything new it reiterates the same material from previous pols classes the prof asks way too many questions but she makes her lectures concise and to the point
5.0,M,one of the best teachers ever had has a wonderful teaching style that makes going to class very worthwhile he truly cares about the performance of his students also a very funny guy
2.0,W,i took another con law class in undergrad that covered the exact same stuff but mccluskey really butchered the topics she was pretty much incomprehensible so i relied on my undergrad notes for this class she means well and is nice but really deliver
3.0,M,yes he erases problems fast but he really has a heart if failing he will try to accommodate you if in there the first week and keep up with him drop the class because he gets better
5.0,W,dr sinning is wonderful she cares read the notes golden must attend class to take notes do not buy the textbook
4.0,W,prof sinning is awesome she makes tax accounting much more understandable than reading the book my advice do not buy the book and go to class all of the time warning she will throw information into tests that you have never seen before to trip you up so be careful make sure that you know her notes all of them or you will fail
2.0,M,not fun not recommended at all you can take the same class learn just as much and not have a nightmare semester thanks to dinero not helpful not understanding gives no slack class is interesting but he is a
4.0,W,she was a very very nice person and extremely helpful class was never the full time period and she gave a good amount of time for all assignments four papers and class work is graded it is important to go to class i would take her again
5.0,M,good professor for honors micro the tests are pretty easy if you study and keep up with the reading willing to help with anything you have question on not recommended if you fall asleep easily his voice is a bit monotone
5.0,W,this is my favorite professor at ut i loved her anyone who is an english major needs to take her just for the experience she allows you to love the subject without being a jerk about grades i actually learned from her
4.5,W,greta was very helpful she can come on intimidating but has sincere care and concern for her students she is tough for our own good i came away from the class wtih an a and am positive that taking the course will be my reason for many to come let the other comments scare you
5.0,M,web-based i wish most teachers designed their web-based classes like mr unger he was thorough clear and creative in how he got us participating as a group i learned morea about my classmates in this class than in a traditional class read study interract and take the open-book quizzes and tests you will pass a with a little effort
2.0,W,i have never met a professor who is so rude and condescending to students she would humiliate students in my class on a regular basis obviously thinks the world of about herself constantly very harsh grading and gives tons of very dry reading i would never recommend a class with her
4.5,W,prof neves taught this class in the summer the daily format led to a challenging class with a huge amount of reading but the class was wonderfully stimulating prof in-class discussion format causes students to think take her class if you can you will learn a lot if you do the work needed to learn
1.5,W,she is completely rude and difficult to understand she is not helpful nor gracious
4.5,W,andrea neves was one of the best professors i ever had she taught me that if you have high expectations get high performance she is a fighter for students who are disadvantaged because of their socioeconomic backgrounds she is simply an amazing woman
4.0,W,i know why everyone seems to hate her i liked her yes she is a hard teacher and yes she requires quite a bit of writing but this is college not primary school and as far as an a being impossible that is so wrong i got an a maybe honor students are held to higher standards or maybe you were just too lazy to do all of the work
1.0,W,you mean still there i had her back in late and was a nightmare then i dropped the class and took a different section later on
3.0,W,morna is great she is extremely knowledgable and pleasant an excellent resource inside and outside the classroom
2.0,W,okay but she assumes that you already know what to do for stuff when you and acts disappointed when wrong really confusing but if you catch her on a good day nice pray to god that you have a in her class or screwed though
3.5,W,morna is one of the nicest most interesting ppl in the world she has good stories but they dont always relate to what youre doing she doesnt always make it clear what she wants but if you dont give her what she wants she will tell you and help you make it better do your work and care about it and she will be nice during crits usually
5.0,M,there is a reason grout is so loved on campus he is a kind man with immense knowledge and passion for architecture and teaching while he is one of the easiest history of arch professors students are happier and generally more interested in learning with him than in other classes a wonderful man who every teacher should aspire to emulate
1.0,M,coleman is a hugely influential teacher and is very knowledgeable but he is very unclear about his assignments his final for this class was horrible and he still given back one grade from the beginning of the semester he is intimidating and nothing you say is ever good enough
4.0,M,there is no doubt in my mind that coleman was the most influential professor i ever had i was a student of his yrs ago still in awe of the learning experience i had in his courses anyone afraid of hard work thinking critically or extremely needy should probably forget about this dynamic prof
3.5,M,look past his bully act and find someone remarkably intelligent and genuinely caring think rationally keep your emotions in check open your mind and put serious thought into the things that bob says and you will benefit tremendously from him only those who put true and honest effort into their studies succeed with bob
2.5,M,coleman expects to much from his you are a full time student i do not suggest taking any of his was not expecting an easy a from his class i do not expect any english class to be easy i spoke with him multiple times during his office hours instead of helping me he demeaned my intelligence
4.5,M,while bob class was undoubtedly one of the most difficult i have taken with high expectations and a large workload i can honestly say it was one of the best classes taken at ssu i am more proud of the work i did in this class than in any other bob also puts an incredible amount of work and effort into his classes
3.0,W,totally out there shes funny she she will call you stinky and ramble in but shes great
5.0,W,she is the best math professor you need to take math take her and you would be fine
5.0,W,she was a very helpful teacher and anyone who wants to pass and graduate obviously has to do the work so why not take her and enjoy it give her a break a math teacher how easy is it to teach math and still maintain the attention not easy but she does it well
5.0,W,she makes math so fun and out of her way to make you understand she is a wonderful professor take her and you will be you take her you will be a dum ass
3.0,M,great if you are the type of person that likes your work back right away stay away from tim he does a great job making the class interesting but is not very good at keeping the class on topic you have to be willing to read all the required material and also go see him in his office if you need help i suggest this class
5.0,M,cool class very interesting take notes on all of the items in lecture and study the syllabus handout and you will make an a he is a great professor you will really like this class did i mention no book yeah save some money
4.0,M,he is very smart and knows what he is talking about o-chem was something i knew nothing about but i left loving it his only downside is that he chooses favorites and is very arrogant he was also very unorganized in handing back if you can deal with that it is very worth your time to take his course
1.0,M,the worst teacher i have every had i took him for engineering physic spends to much time going over the note that he did not even write himself and do no help does not explain himself well his test are super hard no one got higher then there were students when the semester started and only people were left when the semester ended
3.0,M,his class is boring but how can anyone make english law interesting especially during the and class his test are diffcult so are his papers but he does give you a clear direction of where to go
1.0,W,this teacher is usless if you are trying to learn she is very smart i giver her that but as a teacher useless her lectures were nothing to do with the test most of the time the notes she handed out were very confusing and useless you never knew what was going to be on the test basically she just is not teacher material
1.0,W,this professor is useless had her for the online portion of micro and it was hell you know whats going to be on the test and it an online class but you do all the test in labs lab test and she put your grades up on blackboard after the test take her run
1.5,W,very frustrating teacher had a hybrid with her and she respond to e-mail no phone calls back we only got our grades after ms thompson got on to her for not grading tests not sure what it is doing behind the scenes but she needs to use better time management or work less teaching avoid her ms thompson rocks
1.0,W,i would not take her again she taught the online portion for the hybrid class but not the lab this makes it difficult because like different classes she never responds to emails and doesnt answer her phone you never know what is going to be on the test so you have to study everything since you cannot get ahold of her to find out
3.0,W,this is a hybrid class she will e-mail you within days of you sending are multiply choice and given at the beginning of class and then you will take the lab quiz the reference materials are too numberous making it difficult to gauge what might be on the test absorb as much as you can or be sorry on test day
4.5,W,she is so amazing she really pushed everyone to think and act like scholars and not just students she is way encouraging and super friendly this class was the highlight of my educational career i could write novels about how much i like prof siegfried
4.0,W,i remember reading all the postings before the semester started and promised myself i would not let her scare me off after the day what everyone is saying is right she is the best professor at byu never been pushed this hard academically i usually average low high i just got a b on the midterm if i can do it anyone can
5.0,W,oh my god i made a c on with shelton and an a in her class she got me interested in history awsome teacher the best too bad she will no longer teach at san jac was her last sem to teach
4.5,W,she was a great teacher i took her in a mini over christmas break she was good i would suggest her to anyone
5.0,W,very nice teacher her class is easy sit there and dont even have to take you will pass quizzes are extremely easy as well i would take her for all my other classes as well if i could
5.0,W,i dropped hist three times before i took her class and i got a highly recommend to someone who do not like to read too much
4.5,W,i was nervous about taking history in a mini but wow no book she gives you fill in the blank notes and her tests were so easy that you not get an a i learned stuff too telling her
5.0,M,fun teacher lots of discussion no reading definitely knows the subject well as he has had a lot of jobs in the field
2.5,M,there are quizzes every other day and assignments every other week the questions are ridiculous he asks things that make any sense this class is boring however he lets you take the tests in class and lets you talk to students in the class avoid this class at all costs i learn anything
4.0,W,great teacher a fun subject and she is organized and clear about what she requires the midterm and final are extremely straightforward just do the readings at some point the research paper is work but the fact the subject matter is interesting so it goes by fast i would definitely recommend this professor and class
4.0,W,very nice and she knows what talking about make sure to take good notes bc the tests rele come from paying attention to what she says in class a lot of rdgs pretty lecture based but with very fun enjoyable tv clips cool
4.0,W,awesome very knowledgeable has a clear plan of where she wants to go with the class concentrates a lot on radio in the beginning so expect a lot of historical readings very good about answering questions and clarifying when you are confused highly recommended
4.5,W,she is a very good teacher very knowledgeable about art history her lectures are very thorough and you have to able to take good notes her exams are hard but she curves and there is extra credit so its not too bad
5.0,W,an amazing teacher and a great human being knows a lot of the subject matter exams are challenging but great art historians have to take al least one of her classes you will be able to keep waht you have learned for teh rest of your life great class
4.5,W,wonderful she talks fast but you can always ask her questions very easy to talk to she is cute and a sweet heart you forget her take her if you are interested in art
5.0,W,i took two courses with her in the same semester-i loved it i have been more excited to wake up at am her teaching method is to tell a story sometimes making implications its like going to listen to your favorite aunt and have her show you pictures and tell you stories about them great professor fair grader
4.0,W,definately not the best at nyu but she knows her material yet she is so nerdy and laughs so much at her own dull jokes that her class is not really what you would call fun her quick facts are cool though
4.0,W,i have prof wallace for advertising and society and i love her she obviously knows a lot about the subject and has a lot of interesting educated opinions although she object to discussion she has a lot of visuals necessary for this kind of class and plus just adorable but she take so give her any
3.5,M,he is a good prof who tries to ensure he is making each point with clear he is hard to approach however as he always seems busy make sure you have questions prepared prior to speaking to him or treat you like your stupid
5.0,W,i had sue for language thought and culture it was at in the morning and her great energy made it a lot of fun the class literally changed the way i view the world and role in absolutely everything it also was why i decided to go abroad
4.5,W,although she may be intimidating i can honestly say i learned more from her than any other professor if lazy then search elsewhere sue is a lively force she pushes you to produce your best work and gives you the education every student should hope for definitely a professor dedicated to her students and their educational well being
4.5,W,i know what nyu students who complain about the difficulty of a given class expect from their education one thing to recognize a challenge but quite another to characterize such rigor as a shortcoming of the professor sue collins is an excellent prof who fairly challenges her students lazy individuals-please spare us your thoughts
2.5,W,i had to drop this class she assigned literally three times more reading than the other professors for the same class also there is an incomprehensive quiz at the beginning of the class which asks random and trick quesitons almost half of the original class was gone within the first three classes
5.0,M,this man is a genius he was by far the best professor i had at western his lectures were insightful meticulous and often times hilarious best of all he tactfully and efficiently poke fun of idiots his grammar lectures after an essay test
3.0,M,this class is the easiest i have ever taken he is a little boring and rambules a lot but he gives all take home quizes and all the questions for the mid-term and final are from the is a sweet older guy
1.5,M,horrible i stand sitting through his pointless lectures that even pertain to the material being covered he mumbles on and on and he gives out too many take home quizes that are extremely time consuming
3.5,M,i took his health class online it is so easy pretty interesting too you do need the book to answer the bi-weekly which are easy only a couple of questions and open book u dont need to read the book the discussions are based on your own opinions the only projects are diet analysis and one paper on any health subjec
3.5,M,he really does know what talking about and a really nice guy but he really know how to teach he goes through a lot of slide shows that pretty much copy paste what the book says you must work hard in this class because you get too much from the lectures just too boring take him if not interested
4.5,M,i took him for an online class and have any issues there is a lot of reading assignments but the class was interesting and kept me focused assignments were pretty straight-forward except for the diet log which some of the instructions were a little unclear he is a fair teacher and made my first online class a breeze
1.5,M,an excellent professor extremely strict and the majority of his testes are extremely challenging take him only if serious about biology
5.0,M,the best math teacher ever had he is so good at explaining things really easy to understand what talking about
4.5,M,i had so much fun in this class i looked forward to attending every day he really made the class interesting and funny was also very good about working with the class on due dates and helping with papers great teacher
3.5,M,he is a terrible professor some girls think he is hot while some guys think he is cool however he is a rigid marker a boring lecturer and a cranky person as if he gets off on trying to strike fear into some of his students
4.0,M,fascinating lectures great material and an incredibly smart man hard as hell but he is generous with extensions beware the final exam
3.0,M,amazing take his class he is crazy and a hard grader but good for the mind and really teaches a fascinating class
2.5,M,honestly he is one of the most eloquent men i have ever heard speak however it proves to be hard for him to stay on track lectures are extremely hard to follow due to his presentation in other words so smart he needs to hold it back a little bit he is very emphatic about the new testament and extremely stringent with grading
1.0,W,the class is really boring and she is no help at all i went to her office a few times and that was just a waste of time the final project is kind of interesting tests too bad if you knew your stuff
3.0,W,her class was interesting and well structured but is covering a very difficult subject matter so it was understandably difficult at times extremely nice and knowledgeable woman
2.5,W,nice lady lectures are dull and pretty repetitive it hard to keep track of terms because she doesnt go in chronological order she grades pretty hard and points out very trivial mistakes but gives flexibility with paper writing
5.0,M,funny guy he really knows his stuff if you read the textbook you will be fine for the tests make flash cards and do the essays before hand and see him during office hours he will give you answers and help for the tests very laid back wait to take him again
3.5,M,he is a super nice guy and loves history but class is very hard used to be that he had quizzes once a week which were a pain but the tests were impossible so at least you could count on them to help you got rid of quizzes so now just the impossible tests very hard for a ger i would recommend someone else
3.0,M,a good guy genuinely no more quizzes and really difficult exams but he wants you to do well so if you see him he is an extraordinary resource he will go out of his way to make sure you are doing well if you just show you care you dont have to read the book but it does help a lot he goes over everything in class id take him again
3.0,M,to everyone considering taking him heres a totally changed his style no more quizzes or matching on the tests the tests are all fillin and he gives no specificity on who to concentrate on so u have to know who over people are for a test on top of at least essays which he grades hard cool dude but be cautious
3.5,W,she is an ok teacher but i think she should act more professional and keep her personal life personal
2.0,W,really is not a process oriented teacher at all if you already know what questions to ask take her classes nice person who tries to help if needed but not a great teacher

5.0,W,she is a wonderful professor i enjoyed her calss and learn alot from it take her course
3.0,M,had him for spanish and he comes off as arrogant hecause he likes to boast about his education and his successful friends try to pay attention to the things he emphasizes as they show up on the tests at least in although he is pretty arbitrary in his grading he was sometimes flexible and willing to negotiate points on exams

1.0,M,the proverbial one trick pony typical never built a thing to see his work its laughable
1.0,W,the bigest problem with her is that she picks her favorites and if you are not one of her favorites you are the the earth and she makes it very clear to everyone what your social status is along with grades she will give you tests but you will never know what your grade is because she forgets to grade them
5.0,W,she is an amazing teacher

4.5,M,i had kwag years ago and still remember his classes you have to go to every class and do the work he is an outstanding professor and notices who shows up and who does not extremely smart and you will learn a lot from him more than willing to help but if you keep up with the work it will run you over

4.0,M,i think that everyone of you that has written a bad review about mr pouncy should reflect on why you received the grade that you did if it is hard for you to figure out what he wants from you then you need to take his advice and visit him during his office hours just like he tells you if writting is hard for you then take someone else
1.5,M,his class is super hard what you call if you want an a your a will turn out to be a c or if he really really does like you a b a good person from the inside but not a great teacher
2.0,M,he expects you to be at his level of knowledge regarding literature and the world in general he would be off teaching at major university with his phd this is a community college not harvard
3.0,W,mrs laidlaw was an extremely resourceful teacher considering she teaches a subject more people would rather die than have to perform take her once a week class she tends to cancel some of them the final speech was optional also a really fun and interesting person and makes speech worth your while and money fair grader and gives good criticism
1.0,M,yeah as we all know chem is really hard i have gotten in my o chem classes but dr berg is just purely an incompetent professor if anybody who knew how to read english and write english with the help of periodic table thats him doesnt know a thing about teaching his exams are from the voo doo run from him
1.5,M,time for an honest review i got a b in goes way too fast when explaining the lectures how r you supposed to get ahead when you have no idea where in the book he is teaching from he covers random sections in the book and uses different methods to teach material i absolutely do not recommend this office hours avoid at all costs
3.5,M,ok class he often made jokes no one would get but he was a nice guy

5.0,M,i hate statistics like a foreign language only specialists use it but tarski is clearly a statistical expert because he taught me stats and i actually understood a good amount of the topics the course seems extremely hard but i pulled through with an a
1.0,M,worst teacher ever he not only has a thick accent but speaks to the board he assigns a used car project and explains nothing about it no help what so ever do not take

5.0,M,he is a very good professor all you need to do is do the assignments and make sure you turn it in on time the exams were multiple choice and short essay the essay questions are usually given out a week before the actual test i think if you do all the work you should be fine excellent professor and very helpful
4.0,M,miss his but do not worry he warns you in advance we had to buy different novels i suggest getting them early because many student had a hard time finding the end of the session i got a b his are easy just read the books his mid term and final consist of an essay and questions
4.5,W,great professor she is really helpful and knows how to teach spanish real well as long as you come to class and do the assignments you will do well i highly recommend her
5.0,W,mrs martin was by far one of the most engaging most dedicated and most valuable teachers that ever had and i have had some very incredible professors any student that goes through her classroom is the better for doing so
5.0,M,mr trentam is one of the funnyest and easiest teachers i think i have ever had he makes class fun and gives you all homework answers he will help you with a test for sure just dont ever leave a blank on a test if you fill it in with just any thing like a smiley face even count it lol awesome
5.0,M,great teacher there is a reason all his classes fill up very quickly take him you will regret it if you
5.0,M,still the best take him if you must take accounting i urge you
1.5,W,if it for the fact that she took attendance i might not have made it considering it should be an intro class in a subject i normally love her lectures are the readings and as for grades she gives you what you probably deserve minus one letter point when discussion happens she lead and it quickly becomes repetitive
2.5,W,all she did in the lectures was summarize the readings if you did the readings the lectures are extremely boring and useless chantal does not encourage class discussions or participation we also watched quite a few movies a nice person but a lazy professor
1.0,W,she is annoying
2.5,M,roda can be hard to understand since he talks really low so you might want a seat in the first rows he is a harsh grader but he looks like he have a curve on most quizess and test everything is based on the reading which can be hard to understand themselves somethimes he will go overthings that wont be on the test overall its a hard class
1.0,M,hated this class although he may be a nice old man he is nearly impossible to understand is the most unfair grader i have ever encountered does not care how much effort you put in studying wise there is no chance of extra credit his advice do better on the next one i would never take a class with him again if you paid me
5.0,M,took ethics with him basically yoda i would kill anyone for roda awesome

4.0,M,tests are hard but he gives review sheets with exact questions on them he is hard to understand but if you do the reading and ask questions the class hard he will help anyone who wants it
4.0,W,this is an incredible teacher however you must be ready to work with no book that is very unconventional for us older students but you will make it she will go above and beyond her calling to make sure you get the lessons you just have to ask her if you are really struggling she will help you outside of class i highly recommend her
3.0,W,as a person she is wonderful and kind i have taken the week class since it went too fast i was there everyday and did my best but transfered out of her class and into a full semester of elm alg i now have an a i like the fact if you finish checking your work because you see it in your head mark you wrong
5.0,W,this teacher is extremely helpful she move on to the next lesson until everone understands the course is weeks long and moves pretty quick attendence is key to everyday class the previous comments by people who like her more than likely go to class regularly and they fell behind she knows her stuff
2.0,W,this is the most horrible teacher i have ever had she wont allow you to make up tests she makes your final counts double or though i had a doctors note and a field trip for another class recently she has been behind and has taught around lessons in class this point only around people are passing her class
4.5,W,she is wonderful
3.0,M,i took lawson for college algebra and i must say that at times his teaching methods can be confusing hes a little irritated by somethings but only if class gets out of hand a bit he recommends to only use the website and not the book i learned more in the math lab
5.0,W,i just love her she is so helpful understanding i hate math and she tries so hard to make sure you understand everything she takes her time and puts math on a level that you understand i cant say enough great things about her take her class
4.0,W,not sure but i do think that shelly tests are easier i took this class at the same time that a friend of mine was taking and her tests seemed easier ms johnson is awesome though i took this hybrid if you ever have a problem and your work is going to be late just tell her homework due every couple of days
4.0,W,this was a online class you do all your work tests at you ever needed help ms sowell would work problems for you or offer to meet you online she seems real nice and i would take her class
3.0,W,i took her online elementary algebra class she was an okay teacher the videos and notes were very helpful but she really that helpful she took forever responding to emails and she let you make up any work she the worst teacher but she the best either
4.0,W,ms jones is an awesome professor she is really nice and if you pay attention she makes math easy to comprehend
5.0,W,i really liked ms jones i thought she was a great teacher and i would recommend her for people who are afraid of algebra and need extra help
2.5,W,took the class on video i will never do that again all material came straight from the book only two tests so they covered at least chapters each the text was a horrible read i recommend not taking her especially not during the summer
2.0,W,she liked to single minorities out and ask them things about their culture i would have felt uncomfortable it were me
4.0,W,she is very hard i ended up changing teachers because i was spending more time outside class doing the assisgments that was required she also requires you to turn in everything online and take every test online so if you do not have a computer and do not want to spend your entire semester on this class only do not take her
1.0,W,mrs lawson is out to brain wash all of her student into thinking like she does she insists that you agree with her and if you she might throw you out of class do not waste your time
1.5,W,she is the meanest womman ever met she needs to retire and you wont learn a thing
5.0,W,fantastic teacher very helpful she only required to read the chapter and take a quiz
4.5,M,prof d martin is a absolute gentleman open book quizs multiple choice exams lots of extra credits lowered bar he does everything to help you pass the class there is one minor thing about him though sometimes he spends too much time helping out students who falls behind some advanced students may find this little boring
3.0,M,his analogies are a little off sure and old so he likes anecdotes also on be as precise as possible he took off for using abbreviations on diagrams that he used although since he did explain what they stood for some might say they were common knowledge for cpe majors you say wholly unfounded cut corners
5.0,M,omg simply the most amazing person i have ever met in my life i truly love dr wise i wish he would have waited until i graduated to leave though so very talented omg i am so at a loss for words
4.0,W,awesome teacher one of the funniest teachers ever had assigns a lot of reading but not an overwhelming amount definately try to take her class
4.0,W,very sweet a little absent minded sometimes but to a minimal degree without too much interference to her teaching her critiques were nice because she could usually point out a projects merits but balance it with constructive criticism enjoy her class if you enjoy a lot creative freedom

5.0,M,while i profess any real interest in geology i appreciated this passion you will learn alot despite your best efforts the perfect model of what a good teacher can accomplish he really sets the bar high for his coworkers
4.5,M,i have never been that interested in science but bob filson was one of my favorite professors he made the class fun and his lectures were actually interesting the tests were hard but easy to make up for in other areas i am totally amazed thinking back on how much i learned from his class i actually looked forward to it every day
5.0,M,this guy is a great teacher with extreme passion he cares very much about you learning something his explaining ability is a top notch complex and incricate concepts come to be easily grasped after his explanations definetly recommended
3.0,M,i hate him it was a hard class so if you are not a slacker and like geology then this is the right class otherwise find an easier science class and more interesting teacher to fill your credits
5.0,M,best math teacher i ever had highly recommend his class i would take him for every math class if i could
5.0,M,is a great teacher he comes to class ready to teach and will do all he can to make sure you understand the work
2.0,W,lets just say she is boring all she does is sit at her desk and read off her notes the class is based off of attendance three tests and two papers it was so hard not to fall asleep in the class if you have to take this class save yourself and do not take her
3.5,M,i thought his class was really hard the astronomy labs were really easy but i thought the tests were hard i took notes every day and read my book and still never made an a on a test
1.5,M,he is a boring teacher to listen to he reads everything straight off the powerpoint his tests are incredible will put you to sleep during lecture i would take mann over this guy for lecture
4.0,M,pretty good teacher he will tend to teach more to the pretty girls in the class and does waste a large amount of time flirting but over all not bad at least he grades pretty easy
2.0,M,scatterbrained is the best word to describe her i probably caught her class at a bad time because her dad was about to die and she probably should have taken the summer off to be with him instead of trying to teach also hard tests boring lectures pointless labs nice lady though
2.0,W,scatterbrained is the best word to describe her i probably caught her class at a bad time because her dad was about to die and she probably should have taken the summer off to be with him instead of trying to teach also hard tests boring lectures pointless labs nice lady though

3.0,W,if you have to take her keyboarding class take the hybrid class i thought it would be awesome only meeting once every two weeks but she clear on how the homework should be turned in i missed one thing in a lesson and i received a zero for the whole thing very sweet not right for teaching
2.5,W,i wonder if vol state monitors instructors teaching methods five points off for each mistake--one mistake and you go from an a to a c if you have all the documents turned in you get a zero if you must take her class read the syllabus every week and take every opportunity for extra need it
3.0,M,i had him for chem hes alright his teaching methods are kind of confusing he gives multiple choice quizzes which is helpful at times although i myself didnt do very well i think that if you pay very close attention to the first few chapters then the general material will begin to make sense hes also got an extremely northern accent
4.0,M,i really enjoyed having mr neilan as my professor he is a sweet man he knows his stuff and will help you as much as you need just ask the class isnt easy but if you study do the recommended work and pay attention in class you will do fine he really likes to make the class interesting and keep the class involved
3.5,M,his class so bad but his tests are difficult if you dont work outside of class on it you pass do the extra problems if you want to pass
4.5,M,he is brilliant in his field and an excellent professor who is more than willing to help i had him for lab and he was easier than dr snelling in lab the only problem is he is slightly difficult to understand due to his bostonian accent my major is chemistry so i understood it well take him if you can

4.0,W,nancy is a nice person and really wants you to understand the material in regards to the comments on her being mean and rude i did witness that but i think it is one of those things where if you nag her and get on her bad side you stay on her bad side just do the work be nice and ask questions and remember she is a person just like us

2.5,W,her class notes are easy to understand but when she assigns the homework its not what was explained in class notes i feel that she should do some of the even homework problems in class with us so that we can understand the homework better
5.0,M,mr carter is the man he make class very interesting and easy to understand if you take his class your crazy easy a
2.5,M,he is a very boring professor in the way that he teaches he thinks he is very funny while at times he very well may be made us by our coursebook and we did not use it one time not even out of class to pass you really have to read over the notes on his site if you read the notes everyday you will pass quizzes are weekly mostly a monday
4.5,M,i thought this would be a scary course but he made it really clear
3.0,M,dude is huge and i mean huge and is a rude guy but he knows alot about politics
2.0,W,lana carnes is rude and is now over the marketing department if you have any problems with your teachers go straight to the dean and bypass her she is unhelpful and judgemental she will also take the side of her teachers even if you provide evidence of grade discrimination
5.0,W,this class was extremely easy if you do the work this class should be an automatic a in addition dr todd is great about letting you know about scholarships and other opportunities definitely stay on her good side
2.5,W,her actual class was not bad we had interesting converstaions and lectures were interesting attendance is of your grade so if you plan on attending class thats a plus you have ten page papers in this class the rubric is not great she is impossible to get a hold of and if you do poorly she gives almost no feed back or reasoning
2.0,W,if you want to turn in a page paper every week then take her class her grading is very hard lectures were so boring so plan on getting a lap top to pass time she never looks at the students when she lectures just at the ceiling or at the wall behind us take her if you have a choice
4.0,W,excellent class good information for everyone to know the first class is hard but then the second half is easy with only two papers and she grades them easy as well so let failing your two tests lead u to drop the class because an a or b is attainable as long as you do the two papers
4.5,W,she is very nice and helpful but i feel like the material that she covers is very repetative and elementary
5.0,M,the guy is very very smart probably the smartest professor at the school when it comes to his subject matter wants you to really engage and understand the subject if your looking for an easy a like most people at bentley instead of learn pick another teacher who will teach you nothing you will look at the world differently after his course
1.5,M,terrible teacher i expected better from the head of the department but every class he decides to display his knowledge about the topic and branch off to random topics after all that he expects you to know what he meant to talk about also a mean guy in general very inconsiderate when a student was very sick and needed to switch final time
1.5,M,it was horrible he is such a hard grader and he help you if you need him try not to take this class
1.5,M,this class started off pretty well he seemed funny and at first seemed like he was going to be a great i did everything i could to stay awake and study and do well but i still got an awful grade my friend was the smartest in the class and only got a yea
4.0,M,boring class grades kind of hard but if you put in the time you can do well in this class he knows what doing and is always willing to help
4.5,W,i do well in the class but this was a wonderful teacher my grade was not a reflection on how well a teacher she is super nice much better than the other math teachers she knows her stuff i hope i get to take her again
3.0,M,it is a more difficult credit class but in the end your grade could be better than what you may think he can be very helpful but you must approach him you should have some interest in the atmosphere biosphere and lithosphere
3.5,M,a funny guy he started out every class with a half an hour talk about stuff not related to class at all and often made it seem like the world is ending but i guess it kept the class interesting course content gets confusing but grades usually end up higher than i thought they would be
5.0,M,a great teacher and his classes are fun you just have to pay close attention and never get by if you go to class
3.5,W,really nice and makes an effort to get to know you her class is definitely challenging but the benefits are great i had an okay time in her class it the best time but it horrific either
5.0,M,awesome teacher i looked forward to going to his class funny helpful and caring you have four homework assignments which are just a paragraph each you need to do a ten minute presentation you have to read a good book and write a summary about it thats the final his class is easy such a nice man his class is fun
5.0,M,meanest professor at jmu at least thats what he wants everyone to think really nice guy great teacher knows his stuff i hear he can give a lot of work but for this class much i looked forward to every class especially halloween birthday and talk like a pirate dresses up
1.5,M,extremely rude publicly embarassed students on several occasions without legitimate justification i will never take another class from him and would not recommend him to any other students
4.5,M,professor rose was great his intro to media class was fun and i actually looked forward to it he does give a lot of work but some of it is not that bad gives quizes which are not that fun and tests are alot of writting rose is a very helpful professor and cares that you do good in his class take him if you want to learn and have fun
5.0,M,i really enjoyed every class i had with him very informative relevant and fun his presentations were entertaining but be forewarned-the class is a ton of work
1.0,W,do not take this class it is extremely boring and attendance is mandantory she will bore you to death and the test are hard no matter what you study
5.0,M,great teacher you will learn more in his class in one semester than any other history class available i highly advise to take his class
5.0,M,he is incredible he teaches u through the drama he creates and then with his incredible observation and knowledge abt hist he make you interested in the subject and everyone pass his class p
5.0,M,best professor i have ever had he made me interested in things i think i cared about he changed the way i looked at education anyone have his e-mail
1.5,M,not a very good prof his notes are very confusing and all over the place definitely preferred the other profs plus his exam questions straight forward at all very tricky
4.5,M,such a nice and caring man he reminded me so much of a grandfather his tests were a little hard so make sure you study he gives you different options for tests so you can choose what works best for you his lectures were boring at times but you feel bad not paying attention since so nice i would definitely recommend him
4.5,M,a very nice man a really good class could get a little boring at times but overall i would recommend him as long as you read and do all the assignments you will be fine he is also a big disney and harry potter freak a great guy
1.5,M,he is absolutely ridiclious he only grades you on tests but assigns written work that only counts as participation his lectures are boring and his grading is really unfair avoid him at all costs
4.0,M,he is extremely intelligent and tries to be fun and entertaining with his mickey games and reviews for tests he can be kind of boring during lectures but what lectures boring he tries to balance it out with other fun activities you really learn a lot in his class you definitely need to work hard for good grades and be sure to study
2.5,M,overly inflated ego pointless in-class discussions typos in his own book and extremely hard tests way too complex for college-level material horrible teacher
2.5,W,you might as well throw out the syllabus because she spent so much time talking about her life that we made it through about the first four lectures obviously intelligent but she never stays on topic so you learn anything she covers nothing from the book but expects you to know it her actual words and tests very very hard
5.0,M,awesome and crazy he will say anything easy a i think we only had one test besides the final just come to class you have to write a page journal but it is very easy because it can be about anything and i mean anything such as the pizza you at last night very caring personality likes to talk about hot dogs and doughnuts
5.0,M,dr wolf is hilarious you have to take him unless you are easily offended he says anything and does anything he makes you keep a journal but besides that done any literature lol read one story so far
5.0,M,he is the man i have had him for every class he teaches and he is my favorite teacher at eku he is hilarious and very smart and has some great stories to tell
5.0,M,by far the best teacher i have ever had he is a wealth of knowledge on law enforcement and makes even the most boring subject interesting if you comment that his class is hard you must be braindead if you go to class and pay attention you will do very well wish he taught graduate classes
1.5,M,he is an ok teacher but needs an attitude ajustment
5.0,W,i love dr wiliams shes a great professor always willing to help you in anyway she can the best
5.0,W,dr willimas is always helpful she makes tcf fun always willing to help in any way she can you can even call her at home as long as you call before pm excellent professor

4.5,M,a great teacher he really does want students to do well he has an accent but honestly i can understand him better than any math teacher ever had very logical listen to his advice and do the hw
5.0,M,one of the best math teachers ever had he runs through the problems in a logical order and the homework is really similar to the exams as long as you do the homework problems the exams and quizzes will be really easy
5.0,W,one of the fairest teachers ever had always explains what she wants out of you she has a great personality and she is very beautiful i reccommend her to anyone her class is intersting too
5.0,W,she is a very good teacher unlike some teachers she teaches you how to write and spend a whole class period talking about nothing she is there to help she even fuss if no one goes to her office to get help she grade hard at all i got a b in the class
3.0,W,she had a quirky personality but in a good way not what i expected from her appearance or from someone so young let her looks fool you very intelligent expect a good grade for mediocre work either i advise planning your papers ahead of time a bit monotone but otherwise a good teacher and pretty down to earth person
2.0,M,i say he is a bad prof once you get the hang of his class he is a bit arrogant and its his way or no way when it comes down to it his class hard if you read and attend his lectures he is all about his research i got a c in the class with minimal effort however an a is possible if you participate and pay attention
2.0,M,horrible horrible horrible never take his class he is such a mean guy and loves to make students lives bad also he takes it out on the whole class if students miss or walk out i know it is rude to walk out but i dont blame the students who did with this guy
1.0,M,worst class i ever took at nt all he does is listen to himself talk boring will except no opinion but his own not a hard class just hard to stay awake tries to piss students off because even he gets bored with his endless slide shows an idiot with half a brain read the book and taught the class
2.0,M,if never had prior programming experience expect to understand scripps lectures having said that he is very nice and a fun prof
5.0,M,he is a great guy extremely helpful and actually makes class fun
3.0,M,make no mistake about it if never had programming before this class will be very difficult that being said jerry is a really nice guy and i ended up with a b and should have gotten a c his car examples are a bit lame but we does try to communicate the best he can
5.0,M,i had prof smith back in although we had different opinions politically and they were discussed at length in class he was one of my favorites the way he conducted himself and the class was wonderful
2.5,W,in person its an online class but we had a mandatory orientation for an hour kind of hyper a little intimidating the online course is somewhat confusing if you look all over the place for clues on deadlines instructions etc gonna have problems she is a bit unclear and that is why i prefer to actually go to a classroom
2.5,M,he comes in sits down and talks for hours straight nevermind if you dont understand off on some random tanget by the time you get a notebook out
3.5,M,he is not my favorite teacher he goes off on huge tangents and honestly hard to pay attention a nice guy and very enthusiastic but i really recommend him the first english class ever had that i love and saying something
5.0,M,he is just awesome tough professor but wonderful
5.0,M,excellent professor i thoroughly enjoyed his lectures and look forward to future courses with him he is very knowledgeable and well published in his field
5.0,W,i her she is an awesome teacher very important the assignments if u make note n ur book ahead of time the in class essay do wonderful she always gives a hint bout the topic the essay besure to have all ur pages marked think bout what u can agrue w the text and comeup with a few sentences memorized before ur essay
1.0,W,she basically care about our situation the worst english professor i have never have in pcc
5.0,M,he was a great teacher and really hammers home the fundamentals he teaches a student as if he knows nothing learning from the ground up i continued to go for repeated semesters because his love for music and teaching would rub off on me he is the best classical guitar teacher at pcc hands down
1.5,M,apparently for a beginning classical guitar class you must have been playing and know to read music i took it for winter intersession for an intro guitar course but from day one he already has the intention of weeding out those who play suggest avoiding him if trying to learn it for fun
1.5,M,this teacher is hard he to trick you on tests there is a lot of outside homework i wound not take this class he makes students feel dumb for asking questions and there is a pretty big paper you have to do
2.5,M,overall tough class lots of group work and has you read a lot of cases back end loads the course so that most the points are at the very end if you work well with others its not hard to do the presentations but he does like to favor the girls for participation points he was an ok teacher but grades very harshly
5.0,M,only b i ever got in math should have gotten a c but i still ed at him about not giving me an a very tough subject calc got a clue
5.0,W,i have had her for three classes and all three she has been a wonderful professor she cares about the subject matter the students and is up to date with current facts and knowledge i would highly recommend her her tests that hard and easy to pass if you try i would take another class of hers in a heartbeat
5.0,W,this is the best professor i have ever had she is extremely knowledgeable and does everything to give that knowledge to her students information i learned there has lasted throughout my entire college career she is a great friend and cares about the lives of her students both in and out of the classroom take her class it will impact your life
4.5,M,very funny other people have said it say it too keep an open mind if you like to argue you better come very prepared you do learn a lot about his personal history which i found motivating rather than offending i learned a lot and would take his class agian
3.5,M,i have to comment about his pipe collection as well he is the man that lives in a pipe other than that take him if you want a professor to actually teach you a typical class starts with him complaining about how poorly his stocks are doing and then he might call roll followed by a quick scan of the chapter and maybe draw a picture
3.0,M,this guy is def the man you dont need to go to class but make sure you show up for tests and do the papers the tests arent that hard since he tells you the essay questions and then the online quizzes help a lot
3.0,M,very nice prof with a warm shy smile i hope he talks louder and clearer i am not a native english speaker and have no idea what he talks about of the time he does try to be funny as i can see my classmates laugh from time to time but since i understand him i know what they are laughing about p
1.5,M,you go to class to hear the same lecture worded differently discussions on fairly easy books simply touch the surface and nothing is in-depth i think stupid although he acts like well-read and intelligent i hope he gets fired all you need to know is read across the globe i just saved you tons of and time welcome
5.0,M,after semester w paulo decided to major in wl i have never met such a dedicated prof who is so passionate about what he teaches that students automatically become engaged in discussions i understand the nasty comments about him cause in the that had him none of the students in my classes ever felt that way about him
1.0,M,prof horta is mean spirited his jokes are often not in good fun and he puts down students indirectly such as by mentioneing that he knows more langauges or something or how they read hamlet really etc ego and arrogance combine for a nasty effect but his course materials can be interesting and he marks fairly overall
1.0,M,horta is a nightmare the syllabus is he manages to make you hate coming to class as they are excruciating and boring as hell he blabbers on incoherently about everything else but the books flirst with students and gets most of his facts teach just parades his ego although an easy class avoid if you value your sanity
1.0,W,she makes one mistake per minute on her videos what a waste of space extremely rude and full of herself plan to learn anything
1.5,W,most of this class is online if you take the in-class version still mostly online work is hard but she is enthusiastic about it and understand that we share her passion i will avoid taking any more classes from her although i worked my butt off and got an a
1.0,W,she is indeed a very pompous lady whose class has absolutely nothing to do with the use of statistics in education if you want to figure the average number of tissues per box and can meet each of her tedious mandates for posting assignments you will pass she is not open to communication and is highly judgemental
1.0,W,has anyone mentioned what a waste of breath she is as an instructor she has no idea what she is doing is arrogant and pompous for no reason and needs to go back and take stats again herself
1.5,W,avoid her classes if at all possible i took her anova class and made an a yet i can tell you nothing about how to do anova try to take the stats classes in the psych dept or with godfrey instead
4.5,M,people told me their english classes were a waste of time but this class was not like that at all i learned a lot of useful information about different writing assignments the instructor explains how to do an assginment and he answers all questions until you know what he wants i recommend inman because he cares about what you are learning
4.0,M,geez that guy left the art institute over years ago i heard that he had heart trouble and died dude let him go he was an ok sociology teacher but his expertise was in video
4.0,M,classes are boring but all the powrpoint presentations done in class are also available online his tests are directly off of the study guides word-for-word and there are no assignments outside of class extra credit is easy to recieve as wll
4.5,M,i have dr haynie for both american history and western civ right now i absolutely love his class somedays boring but other days way interesting i would recommend him to anyone he puts all the powerpoints online and you print off the study guide word for word questions on study guide as the test easy love it
2.0,W,if you miss a single class than you have to take the final if its excused she give a flip so just go
5.0,W,easiest class i have ever taken this lady is so funny and engaging that i never even thought of skipping until i completed the course work about weeks before midterms i would defiantly recommend this class or any class she teaches for that matter

5.0,W,this lady is amazing the most accommodating professor ever sometimes to the point of being a little too easy on her students however at the same time she provokes students to participate in very intellectual thought and conversation i highly recommend her
4.5,W,adele rocks not surprising that most intro students like her she use powerpoint and makes you think out of the box she can be scatterbrained but she knows what talking about and she loves what she does if you put effort in you will be rewarded
4.5,M,tulovsky is the best teacher at st johns teaches really well easy a take him if you can

4.5,M,he is an awesome teacher that is passionate about the subjects in class he def knows what he is talking about he is helpful when it comes to writing the papers for the class papers are hard but it is a level class so that is to be expected also for a is really hot
5.0,M,dr hoyt is very intelligent and familiar with the class material the material is not easy but he takes time to discuss and explain it until you get it he seems like a very kind and sincere person i think he is a great professor
4.0,M,very cool teacher that you can relate to his test are hard and you must put alot of effort to pass the class and understand the material
1.5,M,do not take him if you can avoid it a deans list student great gpa and took him and it dropped my average significantly if you just need a lab credit do anything else to avoid this so mad the reviews didnt warn me enough people are right he is quirky and sometimes nice but overall his tests are impossible and he is not helpful at all
5.0,M,great class he never said hed curve the grades high score earned in teh class sets the top of hte scale and its down from that for each grade totally fair but science majors set the top i did ok xcept for the final shouldve studied more cuz it killed me learned a lot tho makes you think
4.5,M,very very smart basically knows everything about history and can answer any question give quizzes and assigned homework so if you bomb a paper or test then you are done for participate in class because he likes that a lot he will grade you on that and he will call on you even if you arent raising your hand pretty funny too
2.5,M,really a nice guy taken him twice now and just had a blast socialism was very difficult a lot of the theory material was waaaaay over my head but he will stop class to explain all material and some side stories as well those are the best i feel like i learned more from discussion than actually reading really a great professor
1.5,M,all busy work with outdated reading and over loaded tests-there are only two shameless self promotion of his wife and god has yet to respond to any of my emails and his do all the work i considered changing my major-but this is the general opinion of others involved in this major
2.0,M,when i drop the class like he asked me to he treated me with sarcastic politeness he is unorganized unreasonable manipulative and basically a jerk he acts like he wants to help the students but he is never genuine his lessons are fine but i will never take another class with him as a teacher
1.5,M,he will hold a grudge if he disagrees with your views of what is taught in class really did not pertain to the entertainment industry today was not prepared for class and when i went to his office hours for help he brushed me off saying you need to go research this more i had to go to another professor to help me work though the problem
4.5,M,he is a teacher that makes class fun interesting challenging intellectualizing stimulate and entertaining at the same time he balances his class between lecture style and class discussion based
5.0,M,he is an amazing professor a hard grader but doing well in the class makes you feel good about yourself he is helpful and easy to talk to i highly recommend him as a prof
5.0,M,amazing professor honestly one fo the best ever had polisci my major i signed up for the class because i needed a fourth class i went to meet with him before and he was great nice and passionate about teaching as well as the topic itself easy to ask help kept my attention learned more than any other class taken
1.0,M,he was an hour late for our final and i had a plane to catch a majority of the class left and had to get an n grade until taking the final once spring semester a lot of the material is on research done himself so no way of getting around having to know everything read the book it do you any good take
1.0,M,hes a very nice guy but honestly the most boring class ever he talks so quiet and slow you understand anything he says and he writes on the board you wont be able to read any of it his class makes no sense because he just throws things together and no one has any clue what hes doing do not take him as a teacher
2.0,M,avoid avoid avoid very unorganized and allthe time lucky if he shows up for the final exam talks way too low and slowly lectures do not coincide with the readings grades exams harshly he makes things more difficult than they have to be and only a class
5.0,M,the best earth science teacher at brock he really challenges you to think a lot of readings in his courses but you come out having learned a great deal

4.5,M,an excellent prof can take complex concepts and teach them with clarity insight and without the academic technobabble or high-browed esoteric philosophizing good sense of humor answers questions thoughtfully knows his stuff and is straightforward inspires interest in the subject highly recommend
5.0,M,he is a brilliant teacher makes the class really interesting the tests seemed easy because he tried really hard to make sure everyone was prepared and fully understood the material
4.5,W,she was really helpful over email most instructors are horrible at that so props to her for that
2.5,M,he started out motivated and interesting but after mid-terms barely taught at all leaving the majority of time for lab time uh in-class wow im and facebook anyone and general skipping his notes are a dump of information which he mined for obscure things not over in class for mid-term and finals
1.5,M,dwayne can be a total jerk and i found him to be unreliable and disinterested in actually helping students he tries to be intimidating but just laughable his giant ego live up to his imagined greatness
4.0,M,totally nuts but an amazing teacher had him for classes and want to take another with him
1.0,M,this guy is odd kinda mean sometimes when you see things his way like how he interacts with female students weird acts nice like your good buddy and then can zap you out of nowhere material is interesting but he can be off the wall be careful of him is my best advice
2.5,M,i thought taking a hour long class would be difficult to get through each week but salloway is so interesting and intriguing and always looking to make jokes he is very smart in general and has a deep passion for what he teaches but he is very judgmental of his students and a strange grader with unclear parameters
3.5,M,this man loves what he does sometimes a little too much class lectures include personal stories which are sometimes refreshing but most of the time have nothing to do with the class topic on the exam he actually wrote you will not know all of the answers on this exam then why ask the questions
1.0,M,he made interesting subject kinda boring which is hard to do if you try to get things clarified by him he will make you more confused since he does contradict himself all of the time disappointing you can pull off a b pretty easily an a is attainable if you study and can get lucky on some confusing questions
1.0,M,omg hard understand he seems kind of unreasonable as a teacher i would not take another class with this joker ever again terrible overall
5.0,M,snider is one of the best teachers i have ever had pretty funny and he learns your name very quickly the work is not very hard and he gives you a lot of extra assignments to make up for less than desirable grades

1.0,M,he is very selfish and arrogant on one occasion he threatened to put a curse on everyone not kidding in my opinion he puts a black mark on capital i would strongly advise anyone considering capital summer school to avoid arrey
3.5,M,i had dr arrey for a year for ochem and i think the class is very challenging but he works very hard to help you and i enjoyed him as a person as well
4.0,W,gadbois is a wonderful professor she knows her stuff she is very personable and explains things in non-psych terms so it is easier to understand
5.0,M,paciocco is one of the top professors at the law school and one of the best ever had he has high expectations for his students but he teaches well and sets out his expectations his lectures are completely stimulating there is a reason this man is so popular even though his courses are relatively difficult
4.5,W,excellent teacher provides all the necessary resources to succeed as for me i hate economics i basically just memorized the material and regurgitated it back out for exams not the fault though she tries very hard to make the subject digestible i just have a hard time with econ stuff
5.0,M,dr borders makes literature come alive he allowed me to see depth in passages that i would never have seen myself excellent professor
1.0,W,she was so nasty to students and embarassed everyone whenever she got the chance terrable teacher why did she become one if she hates students
1.0,W,this is by far the worst instructor i have ever had she takes for ever to grade assignments but yet she never takes the time to correct her typos like she leaves them on purpose her tests are really hard and most of the things she tests you over are not in the book or lectures
1.5,W,dona fletcher grades unfairly she is closed-minded isnt willing to accept differing views i found her docking me points undeservedly she has a discouraging teaching style all-around professing for the wrong reasons she focuses on her intelligence rather than helping students adjust to her style i strongly discourage you from taking her
2.5,W,i feel bad here but all i can say about the online class i took with her is third time is a my fault for not studying as much as i should she all that helpful either
3.5,M,don is very much what you will find in the industry very much ego driven if you in his click know it i believe don is a good teacher but what he taught was sometimes wrong and overall cover what i needed to enter into the real world of production if you can conquer don do well in the industry
5.0,W,i am now in the real world of journalism and i credit her for helping me build the right skills and encouraging me to see that i can be successful in a tough business i say this yrs later she is tough but worth it not sure how she is in telecom but if similar at all take the class
2.0,W,the assignments were extremely easy but she tried to trick you for the tests which made them impossible
3.0,W,very hard class organized posts helpful class notes tests are hard she finds a way to trick you assignments that hard but the take off points for no reason and all those missed points really add up not many people get although she uses videos as examples alot i find myself staring at the clock the whole time
5.0,W,she is passionate about her subject and it comes through in her teaching breaking down readings in class encouraging students to voice their interpretations giving clear instructions and guidance on her expectations for each assignment are just some of her strong points fab professor approachable great sense of humor prof parameswaran rocks

3.5,M,a great guy a nice teacher and his class is kinda easy if you take notes and read the book i took him for lab and it was really easy as far as for lecture really nice and will take time to help you out of class but he is a theorist and most of the answers for the homework in the book he made are wrong very unorganized
1.5,M,difficult to understand and he wrote the text so the book becomes useless as well tests are hard attendance is needed to get a grade for clicker problems and homework tends to be complicated as well difficult to know your grade thus my entire class was left wondering whether or not we were passing with an a or completely failing

1.5,W,she knows writing but not how to teach it i think her new personal life is getting in the way of her job and she is not able to successfully teach her class everyone talked to about it her class because her grading is ridiculous and she is sometimes unorganized and unprepared she loses some of your assignments as well--no mercy
4.5,W,she exudes grace even in the midst of difficulty she will stretch and challenge us but the outcome will be worth it hse is a class act who knows her stuff
1.0,W,i have an idea shake up a magic eight ball because it will give you more accurtate responses to your questions than she will and i agree with the rest the anti-christ was more polite than her did i mention she lied to every question i would of chosen a different nearby nursing program if i knew this one was so messed up

5.0,M,words cannot describe how wonderful harris is if dreading the eng req just take any harris is teaching he spends most of class teaching you about life but he knows how to incorporate the important english basics participate in his class he will never be a jerk and allow you to formulate your ideas i love harris
4.5,W,she makes chemistry sound easy she teaches slowly straight from her slides the tests come straight from that but be careful with math mistakes if you have the choice of professors for this class take her

2.5,M,he looks kind of like a young einstein he was a good guy really nice and very passionate about his material but i know what was going on half the time he talked about a lot of stuff that had nothing to do with lecture i was ready to be out of that class
1.5,M,qc is a terrible lecturer so boring and all i did was go on my ipod touch the whole time really nice outside of class though tests are so annoying but i ended up getting and a in the class because i did really well on the final avoid him compared to other profs much harder
3.5,M,qc can be difficult to follow in lecture occasionally quantum is definitely his specialty but he is a nice intelligent guy is organized and helpful when you ask his tests and expectations are very fair all mc average if you can use the book well or have a good basic knowledge of chem worry about it do fine
3.0,M,is a nice guy who explain concepts the best however he does try to answer questions and he is approachable the exams can be somewhat difficult but if you read the book you should be fine since the class average on exams is around i would recommend him if you are able to understand just by reading the textbook
1.0,M,switch professors now qc is an intelligent person but he cannot teach this material at all lectures are absolutely useless read the book and pray
2.5,M,bad professor for chem do not take this course from qc he is brilliant but can not teach the fundamentals of chemistry he wants to be teaching quantum stuff not what an element atom or molecule is
2.0,M,he is horrible
3.0,M,cui a bad guy at all he clearly has knowledge but dumb him self down to teach exams are not that bad i got an ab on the first two and an a on the third exam unfortuneately no curve but he does make a reasonable scale as an and up will be an a depending on class average which he wants to be a b
2.5,M,unable to teach chem a lot of people in my section stopped attending lecture all together because it is just so completely useless he seems to mention the key concepts in lecture but forgets to explain and teach the main concepts better hope for a great ta
1.5,M,professor cui is very unclear in lecture and is incapable of completely answering questioins i would reccommend not taking his class exams are not curved if you are unfortunate enough to have him pray you have a good i reccommend brian parker
1.5,M,horrible as said early he is unable to dumb himself down to teach he may be better to teach higher level chem classes quantum chem is obviously his passion but he is a terrible teacher for he never explains things thoroughly and his tests are extremely difficult and then confused when many students fail
1.5,M,absolutely useless seriously he should stick to research i am barely staying afloat in a subject i have no interest in because i have a decent ta but if not so lucky be prepared to teach yourself chemistry btw i counted rights in one of his most recent lectures keeps you awake in lecture
2.0,M,good guy but a horrible chem professor he does not tie concepts together i recommend him to future students brilliant man but unable to dumb things down
2.5,M,he was not very helpful and is not recommended as a teacher for chem
2.0,W,while she seems to have a genuine interest in the success of her students she seem to know how to help her students her expressing concerns felt more like nagging and less about trying to help me in the class the class is dangerously unstructured and it is often difficult to gauge what she expects from the students
4.0,M,he is a very talented and committed teacher lots of fun too
5.0,W,she is great she has the best personality and is always busting out into characters i learned so much more than i thought i would from this class

1.0,M,very hard to understand you teach yourself basically the first day of class he picks on students he rambles for hours about nothing however if you survive the semster he becomes bearable and if you ask for an extention he might allow it other wise try to avoid
2.0,M,worst teacher i have ever had in my entire life if you want to learn anything about accounting do not take this professor during class he rambles on about pointless stories and tries to cram in the material the last mins of class and expects u to stay after the class is over you basically have to teach yourself the material he is useless

1.5,M,as an a student this class ranks as the most difficult class i have ever taken due to this wants to fail are multiple choice but very were lucky because he injured his foot so dr sanchez took over sanchez was the exact opposite of is still hard but sanchez wants you to sanchez
4.0,M,fascinating thought provoking still thinking about the things i learned in his class in class essays if you take one or two you can make your final of your grade take him
5.0,M,lol all the bad comments came from frosh taking bus i took classes with tim not easy but i learned and survived i graduated and appreciate him very much now he cares about students and wants them to be independent by learning on their own it is his job to maintain the quality of mis grads one of the best professors at sjsu
4.0,M,dr uzman is a fun-loving professor and i think he wants you to have fun while learning the class is not very hard maybe it is because we fall so far behind schedule that he cuts us some slack that said expect to read and digest some specifically assigned reading material on your own because dr uzman is likely to fall behind schedule
4.0,M,this class was extremely hard he expects a lot from like grad school he really knows his stuff and if you ask a question you almost always get an answer in the form of another question his tests are really really hard be prepared to work your ass off
5.0,W,easily one of the most intelligent professors you will ever meet classes are difficult but certainly not impossible dr ball is helpful and wants her students to succeed put in the effort and she will make an effort to help you if you come prepared for class and take notes dr classes should be one of your best experiences at alma
5.0,W,she is a great teacher her tests are hard but you will remember what you learned
4.0,W,knows her stuff and can really make it interesting but cross up with the reading cause she can figure out who is not reading
3.0,W,subject matter is tough but dr eng knows her stuff tests are hard and her project is very time-consuming if you put a lot of effort into the class do the reading and ace the project do fine you will work for your grade in this class but you will learn a lot i would take her again
4.0,M,definitely not a creep dr caspi is a great teacher and i learned so much from him you have to go to class and the work is fair and reasonable he likes students that make an attempt to speak up in class and give their input overall-a great professor
4.5,M,i had caspi for research and child in the community i dont know what everyone is talking about he is so good compared to the other research profs he doesnt give huge reports bc he honestly doesnt wanna have to sit and read fluff which is awesome for us people say he is a hard grader people dont understand he just wants the facts ta
5.0,M,this class was challanging but it was also a level class anyone who thinks they are going to float through this class without doing work is wrong he is a tough grader but a great teacher work hard and you will do well
2.5,M,nice guy who seems akward in class if the class actively participating his group project was easy but i was put with someone who pull her weight and our group suffered he said it rarely happens but i got a b instead of an a because of it he enjoys the topic but the class i had was long and boring never let us out early
2.5,W,nice guy who seems akward in class if the class actively participating his group project was easy but i was put with someone who pull her weight and our group suffered he said it rarely happens but i got a b instead of an a because of it he enjoys the topic but the class i had was long and boring never let us out early
3.0,M,he is a good guy i think he is just misunderstood i am unsure about the grading i am hoping not to get low balled with an a because it will kill my he takes fractions of points off of things which seems unfair it should be right or wrong there is no way to know the exact answer he is looking for biting my nails hoping for the best
2.0,W,she gives a lot of work and made me hate writing method sections i changed my major after having her but i blame her entirely she is really sweet but she gives a whole lot more work that i expected for a level class she is kind of condescending when she says things too it gets a little annoying

5.0,M,he is by far the best teacher that i have had at siue he is extremely helpful and very talented i know he was retired i guess he came back to teach my class but so glad he did if you ever have the opportunity to take his class do it
5.0,M,the dostoevsky preceptorial in the bell tower with mr verdi ranks as the best class i have taken his opening questions brilliantly demonstrated the effectiveness of the art of asking questions and how it is an indispensable preliminary for a close-reading of texts especially incomparable novel the brothers karamazov
4.5,W,jennifer was a great teacher she relies a lot on her ta but none the less is very clear and interesting you need to buy the books just go to class and almost everything on exams is right out of class

4.0,M,seriously nice guy helpfull just read the book gives extra credit points oportunity throughout the an easy class just the usual guidelines plus powerpoints are on line but remember to read the book do not understand what the others commentators rated him low
5.0,M,from day one everything is given online assignments are given and even the essay questions for the exams and final are also given on day one he lectures a lot about what to write for the exams so this class should be an easy a or b if you skim the book and go to class also gives extra credit opportunities professor kaminsky is a nice guy

1.0,M,one of the worst professors ever taken at csulb uses powerpoints from years ago lectures are completely useless counts attendance but no point in attending class study the book for the tests because his powerpoints explain anything since probably using them for different classes cancels class a lot

5.0,M,is a great guy he makes you understand the material and that is his first priority exceptional knowledge he is a gift to devry yet some do a disservice to themselves by cheating because he is not a stickler one of the most valuable classes i have ever taken
3.5,M,you not love this guy loves teaching and is always willing to help you has an old-man-endearing and innocent nature to him always means well and works hard for his students his class is interesting and not too challenging i took world regional geography with him and enjoyed it

4.0,M,homework mandatory which is nice does a lot of examples on the board but makes a lot of mistakes is not a fair grader taking off more points than necessary for small mistakes especially considering how often he messes up on the board overall he is a nice guy though and i would definitely take a class with him again

3.5,M,his lectures can get boring but you dont really have to show would recomend it since on all exams he had questions regarding his opinion on a certain subject the tests require a lot of reading and understanding of concepts covered in the text even though his lectures are boring he would make the class laugh at almost every lecture
3.5,M,the class consists of just exams which are each multi choice he care if you are there or not he only cares about your grades on the exams lectures can make you fall asleep textbook is needed there is a lot of reading for the exams he is a really funny guy and definitely makes some interesting jokes if you catch them
4.0,M,we need a revolution edge is the coolest old guy ever he is so funny yes he does ramble on about current events but he challanges his students to think outside of their own little boxes show up for class and use the study guide for an easy a he has inspired me to become politically to make this world a better place doc

3.5,M,if science your strong subject mr ebert may not be the teacher for you he is extremely nice and wants you to learn and succeed however he expects you to really know every detail and yes the labs are rather looong and un-exciting there was choice and quizzes for each lab great teacher but overwhelming

4.5,M,he is a great professor willing to challenge conventional means of teaching and he is extremely brilliant granted he demands you know a bit more than you should coming into the class but it is a level course after all very lenient and enjoys teaching he constantly makes you realize that you are capable of my more great class overall

4.0,M,loved him in this class he made the philosophy class what its supposed to be wish i could have him as a teacher again sadly i already have ethics done he uses his own books that he wrote for text books so if you have any questions about the reading he knows exactly wht it means

4.0,W,this class bad i enjoyed some of the readings in the reader did not realize it was cross listed with english before i took it too much literary analysis involved for a crs major like myself i got the english gsi so i felt like she graded my essays strictly get the gsis if more science inclined and vice versa
4.0,M,professor sposito is fantastic he makes environmental studies fascinating and painless for students who necessarily excited about science he also brings in some amazing guest lecturers
2.0,M,i hated this class he was very fast-paced and not a good teacher grade was based on tests only no homework attendence or participation taken into consideration

3.0,M,having graduated years ago now dr chinn is one of the trinity professors i look back on ith the most fondness i took intro chinese phil and logic from him and always found him to be kindhearted and humorous
3.5,M,he was an interesting prof i loved his lectures but if you keep up with the reading you were in trouble the marking very fair because it was in such big chunks but he was still one of my fav profs this past semester even though i got one of my worst marks in his class and he also brought in the most amazing guest speakers
1.0,M,ignore recommendations if you take him be sure you can drop the class want to he is an extremely intelligent man but we never once covered more than the first item on the board interesting but not acceptable he is so quiet you can barely hear him this man should teach privately he just does not fit in the academic environment
2.0,M,he is a brilliant there is an amazing amount of information in this head however he is nit-picky about stupid things we read the bible the entire semester but it was an easy a
1.5,W,be has her favorites are unfair if she makes a grading error on your exam you must challenge it in writing even though it was her mistake stay away from her at all costs
1.0,W,this teacher has high expectations of students but moreover has to be right all of the time careful what you say regarding disagreeing as it will bite you in the end try not to stand out she likes to be the one who shines she is very calucating
1.0,W,unfair standards singles people out and picks at them setting them up for failure difficult to comprehend what she is asking for
1.5,W,she talks to fast she doesnt help her class is boring as heck and i just dislike her class in general the material is not very hard but the way she teaches it the book is all that you are using to learn from
3.0,W,i can go ahead and say she is a very good teacher but for the gender comm class i would not recommend taking her she is so pro women it makes taking her class as a male akward and disheartend one would think a class on gender bias wouldnt be so centered on making everyone think the world is out to get women the text book is awful
2.5,W,it would be nice if she stopped talking about her self and teach for a little while how many times do we have to hear about how many awards she has won
2.0,W,needs to her of the worst teachers ive hade thus far at the bac
5.0,W,she was one of my best professors her classes were memories i will keep for life thank you
1.0,M,many know that the world was created in six days and on the seventh day the flying spaghetti monster rested what is unknown is that on the eighth day the flying spaghetti monster realized that all of humankind understood the concept of significant figures so he created donald linn hood
5.0,M,many know that the world was created in six days and on the day god rested what is unknown is that on the day god looked down on his kingdom and was displeased so he created don hood
4.0,M,he is actually a nice guy even though he appears to be tough
1.5,M,and not only that his instructions in his lab manual are horrible not much clarity and you basically have to figure out on your own and out of the blue how to solve some of the post-labs absolutely ridiculous his exams have the most random questions a lot of which is not even from his notes confusing and unclear questions
1.5,M,mr hood is very unfair with his grading policies he is one of those teachers who try hard to take points off of assignments and with lab worth only pnts each point counts slu overall seems that way now trying to weed people out especially in chem lab don is not of any help nor is he courteous when students have questions arrogant
5.0,M,he is such an amazing person he is always willing to help you out he like freshman very much but he has always been more than helpful and his knowledge is spread out throughout all the chem classes he helps me with organic and analytical as we
3.5,M,nice to have a believer teaching in a dept philosphy that has knothing but secluar instructors if your christian take him
1.0,W,she is the worst teacher i have ever had in my entire life she marked me wrong if i did my math vertically instead of if my fratcion lines were diagonal instead of not joking she wont allow you to have scrap paper and then takes points off if there are scribble marks on your paper sucks
1.0,W,it is a huge discredit to ccsu and to dr craine that this woman is allowed to continue teaching she is horrid both as a teacher and as a person what goes around comes around and this woman is surrounded by bad karma
1.5,W,lame professor she only has one way of teaching cant explain the material in a different way no help outside of class and she told me maybe i should drop take a different professor
2.0,W,um i can sum this professor up in two words she sucks nice lady but that doesnt cout towards her teaching ability she focus way to much on the culture and not enough on what we need to know to pass her class she just expects people to know any ding dong can read the book but she cant really help explain what it is that we are learning
5.0,W,profe shea is a genius seriously she is brilliant try talking to her about how she learned spanish she is an exceptional professor and uses a combination of activities powerpoints cultural things and the textbook to teach i absolutely loved taking spanish with her and learned so much a fair grader and likes to tease her students

5.0,W,she makes you work if you are serious about becoming a great writer take her if not find a different teacher
5.0,W,mrs bruce is a thorough and helpful teacher i gained more from her class than i expected to she is quick witted and can be difficult but will go out of her way to help any student pass or make an a

4.5,W,she tries to scare you at first but really eases off at the end of the semester she gives alot of work but if you turn it in on time you will get a decsent grade never had to write so many papers in one class though overall i had a great time in her class and she is fair on grades
5.0,W,very helpful teacher teaches a style that will help for years to come for years writing has not been my thing she essentially tought a formula for writting essays i followed it and topped out the test if you research the test in ga you will find a high failure rate amongst even the best colleges take her and you regret it
3.0,W,definitely difficult to deal with lose points in each gramatical mistake you make i am not kidding freaking points she grade from the scale of she grades from a to b no in her class i like her so far but gotta do well she is good at what she does but tough and condescending enough to ruin it for you
5.0,W,outstanding instructor very passionate about subject and exhibits strong desire to assist students in becoming sufficient writers enthused understanding caring and suggest she teach teachers how to teach more proficiently
5.0,M,dr chapman is a highly educated gentleman he knows history very well and teaches it even better take him you will make an a if you take good notes and come to class he is extremely flexible and work with you as much as possible
4.5,M,mr chapman is a great teacher but you have to study for the tests take good notes read the chapters and pay attention in class easy a the project is fun presentation in front of class willing to help any student he loves history and cares about the students
4.0,M,just remember read the chapter before class and the cd rom helps i am selling the textbook for he is a great prof but he tends to forget that his students are not on the same level he is when he is explaining the material his test are easy the questions come directly from ex in the book

5.0,W,oh felt i just love her she is supper sweet and definitely wants her students to do well sentence translations on tests but she gives practice ones ahead of time not a lot of hw just a workbook that comes with an answer key or oral presentations but pretty easy and she a hard grader take it with her if you can
3.5,W,very good professor explains everything well if you need help she will do well at making you understand the concept spanish lab sucks but you have to do it overall pretty amazing
5.0,W,amazing professor very thorough i would love to take more classes from her
5.0,W,profesora felt rocks she has been one of my favorite professors since my attendance at sonoma she really wants her students to learn the spanish language but also the latin american culture i would most definitely suggest to take her class

5.0,M,had mr salvo for au community band and he rocks so funny and really makes the hour and a half go by fast i encourage everyone to take salvo if possible a hoot
1.0,W,this was the hardest teacher i ever studied my butt off and still didnt understand her or pass the doesnt put what you study on the test
4.0,W,dr manas is probably one of the best professors had she actually expects us to you know learn and apply things her classes are extremely complex but genuinely cares about her students and wants them to understand the material
5.0,W,excellent professor goes out of her way to make sure everyone understands the material that mean easy
4.5,M,he was a great professor he definitely knows what doing like everyone else says he can be harsh but its definitely well deserved if you do what supposed to and just make an attempt to participate find that you have no problems with him overall his class is extremely amusing and he may just be my favorite professor
4.5,M,gerry is seriously my favorite teach ever if you like him probably because kind of boring and lamecity i was not a particularly great student gerry grades very harshly but he was very encouraging and personable i got many bunk grades in his class but because i was kind of a up in my opinion he knows what
3.5,M,his command of russian is excellent for a non-native speaker and he is a very effective recitation instructor however he has a very harsh personality which takes some adjustment
1.0,M,avoid this professor did not grade according to his own stated criteria very late in returning work very limited participation in required online discussions
1.5,M,the most frustrating class i ever took you could never see him during office hours he never replied to e-mails and he was a perfectionists on the assignments i would probably spend about hours a day for weeks in the computer lab for assignment tests really test on what you learned how am i supposed to remember what the photographe
3.0,M,ryan has a very high opinion about himself often name drops the various famous people in the industry he has worked with or interviewed you have to have the book-which he wrote-for his class or you will fail since of the on the test are found in the text he has an unhealthy addiction to kayaking which he brings up at least times a day
3.0,M,first he is the most arrogant professor i have ever had he uses his own book inwhich you have to read to pass the class with better than a c we watched movies about kayaking and if you dont do what he wants on your projects get a bad grade even if your project is good an ass
4.0,M,i enjoyed class though he puts too much emphasis on fonts and his tests are annoying the assignments are fun he loves kayaking we are still friends until today
4.0,M,at first i was very encouraged and found him to be very interesting and intelligent then i got sick of him showing his award winning work with all the famous people he interviewed in his book i ran into someone who said she was in the j school years ago and dropped out because of the arrogant teachers like ryan
4.0,W,at first i was very encouraged and found him to be very interesting and intelligent then i got sick of him showing his award winning work with all the famous people he interviewed in his book i ran into someone who said she was in the j school years ago and dropped out because of the arrogant teachers like ryan
1.0,W,graduating this quarter from cscc and am transferring to another school and from all the teachers i have had so far professor feth is by far the giving a bad review on this teacher is right she will not answer your questions and will talk to you like you are stupid the point in taking a class is to learn and to be guided not
3.5,W,despite what other people have said i think ok her teaching style is not particularly entertaining but you always expect that she does not suffer fools and can be a bit grumpy but she teaches the material in a straightforeward well-organized manner just make sure you think before you ask questions
1.5,W,this is the worst teacher i have ever had in my life and if you have her i would suggest dropping it immediately she is the most miserable women i have ever met she talks down to all her students and if you ask her a question she will either laugh at you or embarrass you in front of the class i hope columbus state will get rid of her soon
1.0,W,this has to be the worst teacher i have ever had between her dull put me to sleep lectures to her egotistical i wrote the text book attitude all the way to her absolutly miss one symbol and you fail grading she is the worst i have ever seen she doesnt care if you fail and wont help you if you are if you are in her class drop it asap
1.5,W,she will not help you with any questions you have she will only tell you to re-read the instructions and do nothing else she treats you like you are still in middle school and always talks down to you she tells you that you have items like laptops even though it is allowed in the cscc school policy
4.5,M,he is really down to earth guy he understands english with a passion this is good because you will understand the class topic we read and write about is pop culture so its never boring discussions are really long and intersting keep you coming back for more
3.0,W,she is really hard she writes the textbook she uses and expects you to know just as much about the subject as her
3.0,M,it was really boring i did everything i could think of to stay awake in that class and never could the quizzes were horribly misleading because of the way they were phrased and he seemed to prefer the papers i wrote the night before they were due to the ones that i worked on ahead of time but he was always willing to help during office hours
4.5,M,took this course as an honors class that bad but he can be a bit of a hard grader on the papers make sure you do the readings and miss quizzes and be fine a nice guy with a good sense of humor and will help you out
4.5,M,awesome prof speaks quickly in lecture but if you pay attention the lectures are very informative a lot of essays but they are intended to improve your writing for your future university would love to take another class taught by him
3.5,M,he tends to rush his lectures and it can be pretty hard keeping up his style is rather theatrical but he reads off his paper in front of him which sort of detracts from it i loved him the one time he covered for our ta laid back and with no notes he joked around answered questions and imparted lots of info his lectures should be like that
4.0,M,the best prof i have had at york his lecture are fast-paced so it is best to have a laptop for taking notes he presents the material in an exciting often humorous way be prepared to work hard there are lots of readings and essays still if you keep you with everything an a is possible
4.0,M,very interesting can you hear me in the back ok and thank you again for turning off your cell phones today we will be talking about he goes pretty quickly but is easy to follow course is tough for first year and to bad he teaching it anymore
4.5,M,haha hotness level zero prof irvine was definatly one of my influences to continue my major in history i agree with alot of what was already written he keeps the attention focused during lecture keeps a fast pace speaks with alot of tone and inflection and tries to make jokes here and there i loved the way he pronounced r-r-russians
5.0,M,prof irvine is the best ever i thoroughly enjoy every lecture even the most boring topic is fun in his class his dynamism also has considerable effect on you in lecture truly loves the material and is eager to talk with you before and after lecture or even just around campus in closing turn off your cell phones
4.5,M,one of the few professors who can keep the attention of the class throughout partly due to the need to write down so much of what he says interacts well with the class through humour and catering certain lectures to student interest if time permits extremely knowledgeable and lectures are well-organized talks fast and expects you to keep up
4.5,M,excellent professor knows his stuff excellent sense of humor does expect students to have an open mind show some interest in the subject and spell check their papers
3.0,M,he is a nice man and will try to help you although he gets frustrated easily the material on his tests hard he just grades them wayyy to picky he will mark off points for spelling errors go over your test many times before handing them in and everything on lab is on the test but labs are easy
5.0,M,dr ryan was one of the best professors that had i do not rate how good a professor is by how easy they are that said he forced me to learn a lot of material that will help me with my career you must study a lot for his class but it definetly pays off he is also very accessable and helpful if you have questions
4.5,M,dr anning is a great prof he is monotone and loves to talk your head off but is also overly willing to help he pays attention to the little details so take the time to cross your and dot your there is no text book so you will have to keep track of your handouts they are used for an open note final
4.5,M,great teacher the course pack is helpful and he gives his students multiple opportunities to learn the material he makes practice worksheets for help and practice quizes you know exactly what to expect he try to trick you and genuinely wants you to learn he is very fair and helpful
3.0,M,he has a few senior moments but theirs tests and you need to study from the book and do the problems o you will have problems i would recommend him
2.0,M,i recommend you take this professor for business stats in the is unclear about the information given in the class he may be better in a regular quarter
3.5,M,i got both quarters i took him so it is not impossible you just have to read the text i enjoyed his class it was boring at times but you can tell he is trying and he really enjoys history he is a little scary but once you get to know him he is actually very understanding he was a lot better than any of the other history teachers
4.5,M,he is a very good professor when it comes to learning but if you are looking for an easy class he is not it he does not let anyone fail no matter how late an assignment is and he is always willing to help out when you struggle he does have a mean side sometimes
1.5,M,he was terrible he just rambled on for his lectures i read the textbook and still do very good on the quizes
1.5,M,he was terrible he just rambled on for his lectures i read the textbook and still do very good on the quizes
1.0,M,horrible class you only were graded on test and a paper both the test were essays and the paper had to be at least pages long and that include the foot notes or resource page he was a hard grader and he had his favorites in the class i would never take him again
5.0,M,easy class if you do the reading and take notes great professor knows his stuff and makes it interesting relates it to current events i will definitely take him again
5.0,W,awesome teacher very knowledgeable very experienced very easy just show up to class and get an easy a she gives you take home exams basically open book the final was open notes so tremendously easy you cant fail this class get out of class early almost every class awesome
1.5,M,beyond incompetent and basically phoned-in every class really could care less about the culture of design or the world we were getting into belongs more in an avant-garde art exploration class then one devoted to design and its history is openly antagonistic rude and disinterested in his students
5.0,W,great loved her would take her again
1.0,M,sohng is the worst professor on campus he may be funny at times but if he would cut out the bs and just teach this class would only take minutes because thats about how much he teaches everyday stay away from him for sure unless you are some econ genius this guy quit teaching a long time ago but yet still has a job weird
1.0,M,this guy is the worst he makes all the students rewrite nova made a bad choice no wonder why hes at a different college every year
3.5,M,i like this class so the he my favorite teacher but i heard he was ok for other classes
3.5,M,eierman is a nice guy he loves what he does and obvious however this class is hard and his tests are the most difficult i have ever seen this course is definitely geared more towards chem majors than any other very helpful when you ask so be afraid otherwise pretty much on your own good luck
3.5,M,eierman is a nice guy he is willing to help and answer questions all the time hard to follow most lectues in class so reading on your own is essential to get an a or b overall good teacher if you are willing to put effort in
2.5,W,you must attend class otherwise you will not pass the class pay attention in class because some questions on the test come straight from class her tests are quite hard and she really tell you what is going to be on the tests other than the tests the class very hard its mostly being in class and you get the points
1.0,W,she lectures you take notes in the notes is hardly ever on the test if you want to have to read every single chapter sign up for her class

3.0,M,the class was pretty boring but the material covered is pretty stimulating dr kinney teaches directly off the slides but he is very knowledgeable not a hard class at all if you read the study guides and go to class not much class interaction at all
1.0,W,unless your a native spanish speaker avoid her she seems unsure of her own language confusing too you never know for homework or on an exam and she likes essays very very clearly outlined thesis support etc otherwise she understand it she directly answer quesiotns either
4.0,W,seriously do your ask her what will be on the very specific about that to class and just be prepared because she does tend to pick on people ask lots of detailed questions at the end of the course because a lot to learn at the very helpful and went out of her way for me many times
2.5,W,a nice prof really very understanding and kind as a person but she marks so freaking hard groans and she expects you to show up for every class and puts you on the spot make sure you do your homework and read the textbook because the course is heavily textbook based if you do your homework she will hate you and pick on you d
3.0,M,too much information overwhelms students with the amount of information and do not give out any lecture notes lectures have some organization but for the most part are all over the place he is very intrested in the subject and gets excited when he lectures which causes him to talk fast while lecturing
5.0,W,i love her my boyfriend is in the navy and when i asked for a week off she told me this class is all about relationships enjoy your week with your boyfriend my favorite teacher by far she is amazingly kind-hearted sweet and caring not to mention interesting hands on projects clear instruction and manageble work load

3.5,W,okay prof i really didnt like her too much she loves to hear herself talk and take into consideration others ideas and point of views she wants you to notice what she notices basically nothing is open to interpretation and the whole point of taking a film class in class exams and a bad want an luck

1.0,M,some one should teach him the material before they let him teach it also some one needs to teach him how to teach it
3.5,M,again ashame to see so many disgruntled students in fact this is a good professor misunderstood at times yes if you take the class properly and open your mind up learn a lot rusty on the details of program usage but what your textbook is for go to him with macro-environment computer questions and teach a lot

4.0,M,take his class if at all possible i feel that any artist who does not have a chance for the experience is really missing out too many teachers set creative boundries and steve does not know the meaning of creative boundries he will give you more information than you can handle if you complete the work and show that you have not held
3.0,W,dr kahan is different from most professors in the psych department she makes you think she expects most students to be able to integrate material unfortunately most other psych courses dont train you for this with multiple choice tests
5.0,M,professor downs was by far my favorite professor in my four years at the university he cares about his students is a great mentor and his passion for writing and journalism inspires his students i took every class from him that he taught if you get the chance take one of his classes
4.5,W,she is an amazing teacher maths have been so interesting she has a great knowledge about the industry she treats you as an adult and does not believe in spoon feeding which i challanging class
1.5,W,surprisingly i got a is unfair and is not the best professor for this is knowledgeable and knows the material but she does not communicate it to the class in an effective is not the end of the world if you get her but expect an a be willing to teach yourself everything and make sure you memorize those formulas

5.0,M,he is a huge nerd but very funny and entertaining there is a lot of reading it is a socratic class so you need to talk and therefore do not need to do the reading all of the time however if you do the reading it will bite you in the ass when it comes to the final he is an easy grader if you do what he says i recommend him
4.0,M,very good teacher very interesting class and very interesting to talk with him he will help you out if you are in need and also makes class very enjoyable very clear with what he teaches and what he expects i definitely think one of the better teachers had at scu even need to buy textbooks he puts them all on angel
3.0,M,dr colcord repeats everything at least times i reccommend that you buy the book because he rarely uses it he takes attendance randomly throughout the semester for a grade i found the material taught interesting but how it was delivered was very very dry
2.0,M,ugh he apparently graded himself times on this because he is not wonderful his tests have questions on it so you can imagine its each question you can retake but if its hard the first time dont expect much the next times overall dont expect leniancy its just an illusion if u messed up on the test its over for you

3.5,M,very nice and generous professor considering he was also submitting a major grant during our class term he is very clear about what will be on midterms does not offer review sessions
1.5,M,he needs to slow down let students ask more questions he thinks cramming you full of mechanisms will somehow make you understand it has hardly any office hours and just impossible to reach if you email him exactly the way he tells you to he respond the questions on the tests are fair but the grading is ridiculously harsh
1.0,M,he is horrible do not take him if you can his tests are very hard and nothing is multiple choice and he has other students grade his work because he he has even lost students work
1.0,M,he was a horrible teacher he never helps you also all his tests are do it yourself no fill in the blank or multiple choice its all on you own he always relies on attendance and he has other students grade his work for him because he does not have the time to do it himself i would not recommend anyone to take him as an instructor

1.0,M,he is really arrogant and unfair not a very good teacher avoid at all costs
1.0,M,extremely unintelligent though well-intentioned the hunger class was a breeze if you read the books but expect to learn anything whatsoever from sanders he spends most of class time showing videos and telling personal anecdotes easily distracted and incapable of clearly answering simple questions easy a if all you care about
5.0,W,had her for intro int loved her been dancing my whole life and i know a good teacher when i have one takes time to correct you individually and answer any questions very encouraging as well caters to all levels as well some readings and short papers but very easy attendence and proper attitude is a must though
4.0,W,gel is very nice when coming to class make sure you dress appropriately she tries to make class fun and pushes you to do your best work out and stretches along with combinations of jazz a few handouts at first that you have to read and respond to but after that you just dance hard but worth it good class you will definetly learn new things
5.0,W,gel is incredible you will learn life lessons as well as everything about dance other professors should take teaching lessons from her she is one in a million love you gel
1.5,M,this class is basically smo with a little more description into hr practices i hate this class with this professor because it provides generalized material with a teach who can not decide on a steadfast and concrete answer once you question his analysis he holds a grudge take with someone else
2.5,W,the reading for my class was out of control and she give very good feedback on papers so i feel like i got that much out of the class
5.0,M,alvin is incredible please take him anytime you can

2.0,M,you will not learn anything from this teacher he can not clearly explain a concept or stay on track with a thought he can not engage the class and he will tell you to prepare for exams in one form and then change it without explaining his test are not fair and will ask questions which are opinion based then mark it wrong
4.0,M,he is a wonderful and very intelligent man he knows the subject very well some people do tend to get lost though because of the way he explains things he might be too smart
4.5,M,was very frustrated first week or so because of his accent but you understand it over time he makes the class easy to understand helps on homeworks quizzes and gives a test review that basically comes from the test amazing teacher to take for calc
4.0,M,has a heavy indian accent after the first week or so he becomes more understandable gives hw assignements as part of the grade he does a lot of examples on the board and relates problems to other classes like physics or to real life situations he is a great teacher and i learned a lot
4.5,M,difficult to understand his accent at first but it gets better gives homework about once a week and helps you if you have problems the day due prepares sample tests very similar to the actual tests which helps a lot
4.5,M,one of the easiest teachers on campus very lenient laid back very helpful when you go meet him in his office has exams a final but the final is optional so if you do well in the exams the homeworks you are good if you did exams bad he replaces your final grade with so that you can get a better grade i recommend you take him

5.0,M,dr shirani understands the field and illustrates his professionalism in class both the midterm and final are extremely challenging for being mcq tricky yet are easy for he specifies the material to study though he has a passive personality he cares about students learning and is approachable read the book and practice sql
1.0,M,he is the worst teacher i have ever taken at sjsu only midterm a final hw assign a lab and it before the final you only completed of the class unfortunately he is the only person teaching this class i learned nothing from him this semester better off skipping class and learning the material on your own

4.0,W,i liked her but i struggled a little in her class at times her lecture was hard to follow but there was time in class for her to help the students privately which she was more than willing to do
4.5,W,without a doubt the best prof had at university yes a lot to read but typical third year reading load so i complain her lectures were insightful informal and a lot of fun great to talk to about the course material during office hours even if you understand it already i wish i could take the course again
5.0,W,great teacher very helpful and cares about her students she gives assignments that are worthwhile to class
4.5,W,kate teaches political science from a liberal point of view in one of the most conservative places on the planet as such she gets a lot of resistance from her students but if you go in with an open mind you will emerge enlightened this class really amped up my interest in politics warning do the readings or you will incur her wrath

4.5,W,small readings due every class not long tho short word essays but she grades them easily she grades on how drastically you change your paper from the draft to the last she really likes a lot of changes no tests final-essay
4.0,W,i took her for fiction writing i and she was really good attendance is mandatory but she is easy if you have an excuse very nice and helpful but dont take her if your looking to get an easy wri grade or if this isnt for your major you do do alot of writing assignments you have to read a couple short stories for every class overall good teache
4.0,W,good class she really cares about your grade you get what you earn and do the reading
1.5,W,this class was ridiculous i usually enjoy my psyc classes and teachers but i cannot say the same for peg she is odd repititive hard headed and very dull just avoid this teacher and you have a problem spending on a book was because we never used it and the semester project was annoying because she is so damn picky
4.5,M,dr liff is awesome really helpful i had him for a summer course and it was really easy able to be exempt from every test including the final if you took physics in high school be fine one of the funniest teachers ever had definitely need to take him as a teacher
5.0,M,professor unger was very clear about his expectations and good about communication the material was laid out in a manner that you could work at your own pace for the most part the journal was tough but that is because it required a lot of introspection study guide for final was awesome i enjoyed the class a great deal
5.0,M,taking the online class it is really well structured the first quiz to take is a quiz on the syllabus so he assures the student has a clear understanding of the expectations for the class repeatable quiz an a is quite attainable so long as you let yourself fall behind follow the suggested timeline great course
5.0,M,marc is a great instructor with a true passion for philosophy they class i took with him but marc commas are your friends and your students too
3.5,M,web class hardly used the sucky book just lookedup the answers online really do much but post a discussion which he loves as little as possible and guessed my way through the tests he answers all your questions promptly
3.5,M,whoever is saying he doesnt offer extra credit is a bold faced lie its even on the prbly never showed up to earn any even read admit i struggled but he always said come to office and he showed exactly where the answer was on our outlines he printed been outta high school and got a b
3.5,M,mr daniels seems hard at contrary to what you read you can easily get a b or an has no homework only tests final that is the same weight of the tests drops the lowest test points extra credit that he adds to your grade so if you have a add those points u get a extra credit is simple he is corny
5.0,M,wow ok of all the people that say a bad teacher are just dumb people plain and simple you probably could just read and look at the outline and still get an a in the class he is always willing to help you breaks the material down so a grader could understand and above all an awesome guy my favorite teacher at tcc byfar
4.5,M,he anything special that for sure sits there and reads everything from a powerpoint i showed up on the test days and thats it studied from the book the grading is pretty easy there are five tests and a final all worth points and you get to drop the lowest test grade for a total of points so you can bomb one test and be fine
1.0,M,bottom line dont take him an idiot and you will know less walking out than you did walking in grade is all test no ec or hw give a crap about his students you will be teaching yourself
3.0,M,every test we have taken i went to his office and he was able to show me on the outline where the answer was true there are no assignments but there is optional extra credit if u do all of them it will raise your final grade a whole letter grade u have to study that why in school it is not an easy a but he is more than fair
4.5,W,it was a lot of work especially the outlining and her tests and quizzes were pretty hard but she was super helpful and very nice though it was hard i loved her as a teacher i am horrible at history but i actually got an a in this class you just have to be willing to put in the effort and you can get an a most in my class also got an a
1.5,W,she never gives constructive feedback only negative feedback i learn anything from her class so if you want to learn take her
1.0,W,the worst teacher ever had she even challenging just rude completely unfair not understanding and judgemental emphasis on mental i loved design and accelled in it but her class ruined my passion she needs to retire desperately take her class old and fake
5.0,M,traveled all over so classes are cool because actually been where talking about passionate about what he does and ramble fair and friendly as far as his tests you have to know your stuff so study and do fine def the model professor
1.5,M,coleman is fascinating to listen to but unfortunately he is extremely unclear about assignments he is not useful when you ask for clarification on assignments and just expects you to know what he means on his obtuse questions very intelligent man but needs to learn how to support students as much as he challenges them
1.5,M,coleman is challenging students basically argue for a whole hours other will say that he is not worth putting up with he does come off as belittling so if you are up for a challenge take this class if not avoid it because you will be put on the spot other than that he has a lot to say and numerous interesting heart wrenching stories
1.0,M,bob coleman is not a teacher he gets off to embarrassing his students if you take this class raise your hand because if your wrong he will belittle you he will spew useless amounts of random knowledge to make you think he is a genius a teacher is meant to guide his students not destroy them
5.0,W,she is an incredible math teacher and an incredible person she cares about each and every one of her students and she will help you as much as you need it she is fast at responding to emails and she is funny too one of the most wonderful and the most memorable professors ive ever had
5.0,W,she is absolutely the best math teacher ever had i have always struggled with math and with her help i passed the class
4.5,W,not a fan of math myself but she explains things in a helpful way
2.0,M,tim is very passionate about whatever class he is teaching but if you are not diggin the class then it gets annoying and old fast pretty easy grader quizzes every week three paper and a final way too much reading at way too fast of a pace
5.0,M,tim is amazing he is always there if you have questions he is a prof that truly has the best interest of his students in mind his class was always interesting and insightful
4.5,M,he wants people to learn but it can be difficult to learn what to do
3.5,W,she really teach mostly watching movies on the chapters and the movies are boring she grades really easily the assignments are easy
4.5,W,i took this class over the summer cuz i heard you have to do less speeches and you do only i was so scared going into it but it really wasnt that bad like i said speeches and tests right out of the book she can be pretty harsh but she still gives you a good grade as long as you have the written wrok done how she wants it easy class
3.5,W,cool teacher funny and you may actually learn something in her class if you play attention and participate i got a grade from her yet so my fingers are still crossed
1.5,W,i had her for class and at first she was cool but then i had to miss class for health reasons and she went bullistic i would not suggest her unless you think u can turn in every assignment be on time to every class and never ever miss a class
2.5,M,the professor teaches in a boring approach its all powerpoints he wants your work to be done exactly how he does it i like physics but im not learning despite the hours spent studying there are only students left in class he gives out a lot of handouts which he revises constantly i do not advice anyone to take him
1.5,M,homework may be miss of one question lose even wrong just show your work or work a different way than what was the class doing problems only to almost from the class tells him what he did wrong and he starts than the class dropped before the test
1.0,M,i am a junior from tsu and he is beyond a doubt the worst prof i have ever heard thinks that he must teach at the mit level takes his responsibility way to seriously and truely just doesnt know how to explain the subject i mistakingly thought i could just teach my self and go to the tutoring you have to be a master to pass
5.0,M,took him back in the early for english legal history courses and one other i forget at the time loved the classes at the time got some of my best undergrad work out of me then again his courses inspired my ill-fated and short lived law school career so not sure if i should recommend him or not
2.0,W,this class was absolutely horrible took her over the summer as a hybrid class no one could ever get ahold of even our lab teacher when the tests were actually graded they were graded by her assistant and graded incorrectly im still waiting on my final grade to be was due yesterday by noon
4.0,W,she was a great teacher and would help anyone on her own time
4.5,M,he really gets down to buisness class always got out a few minutes early and he always got everything in hes very helpful if you need help just go to him the only thing that can be a downside is he went very fast but if you ever missed something in the notes he was willing to give it to you after take all the notes and you have no problems
3.5,M,pretty laid back class no use of textbook and we pretty much ran through test material because we got off topic so much always got out min early and always told us what would be on the test mult choice and lots of short answers also there are observation papers that he grades harder than you would expect interesting guy
4.0,M,burge is the man loved taking this class with him there is no assigned textbook for this class so all material is straight from lectures has a tendency to wonder at times during discussions but overall very pleased two exams two observation papers one final project his expectations can be somewhat vague but great guy overall take him
5.0,W,love love love her the only professor at campbell that has never shut me down when i have ask for help she is very helpful and inspiring wish she taught more classes
5.0,M,professor matheson is a very smart and nice guy he is more than willing to explain any question you have until you understand the concept he gives difficult homework and test but grades it very graciously if you do the work you will get an a in his class
1.5,M,professor matheson is an extremely nice man but makes no sense whatsoever because his lectures were so hard to follow most of the class was left reading the textbook going to the physics lab and studying in large groups for hours upon hours
2.0,M,adorably dorky but not a great teacher what he teaches in class you understand but his assignments which make most of your grade you understand if you must take this class from him be sure to come together as a class and start a study group only way i have survived the semester
1.5,M,easy going nice guy but class was really boring he lectures the whole time and its hard to stay interested plus the subject is very difficult lots of homework reading and test reccomend for a general requirement class
4.0,M,fairly easy and grades on a curve a pretty mellow and nice guy even though you have to go to class much i think it helps because he does a good job at explaining concepts in the book
4.0,W,bvb is a lot of fun and truly understands the hard parts of being a student i make you do readings i used to hate that she has extensive knowledge though i wish she would focus a little more on the art and less on the politics and royal affairs if you take northern be ready to study many french chateaus and royal portraits
4.5,W,you have to know art pieces for both the midterm and the final as a result you remember much from the course but she does give alot of extra credit and she seems to want people to enjoy the course her spanish art one course was the best because you really get to look at art from a perspective it is easy to dote on her
5.0,W,bvb is a great teacher she tells you a lot of information in each lecture but she will repeat things that are likely to be on the exam take notes and remember artists more famous works extremely nice take her classes
4.5,M,is a tough grader will get really snippy if tardy more than once will get snippy if you are absent more than twice will get irritable if not enough people participate during class even with all his moodiness he was very good at critiquing papers and always wanted his students to progress you have to do the work and come to class
3.5,M,okay fruscione seems like a good guy definitely not an easy or generous grader his moods seem to change frequently sometimes really friendly other times he essentially will tell you have no concept of the english language class was a lot of work for uw
3.0,M,took his intro class and when he offered business of media i jumped to take another class he taught even though it was on a friday an amazing teacher and really supportive if you reach out to him need to use the text book much and he was a pretty easy grader if you generally participated and did your blog entries
4.0,M,this is a larger class that feels small because ted allows students to take control of their own learning he brings in great speakers from his contacts and the blogs long-form sector analysis projects are useful to show future employers
4.5,M,marks easy in first year courses but in second and third year such as cart and geomorph he expects a great deal more although if you go to class and study high marks are quite possible
3.0,M,wiseman seems to really know what talking about always willing to help even if he seems a bit aloof only complaint is that he has a tendency to assume his students know the materials as well as he does good attendance is reccommended but his tests are never very difficult
4.5,W,if you are interested in successful professional and academic work in the not-so-distant future this is a realistic professor to take a class with you can decide how much you can read and handle from an assignment standpoint professor collins is an excellent teacher who challenges her students to be the best they can be you ask for more
4.0,W,beautiful woman she will challenge your mind until you ache from thinking but she is a genuine interesting and brilliant scholar she treats you like an adult meaning she is totally on your level but expects nothing less than professional work and vigorous discussion she is amazing and really disappointed that nyu is losing her
4.0,W,professor chen generally knows what she is talking about but sometimes she is learning how to use programs as you are be patient and she will make sure you understand what you are doing do the case studys and you should get the a
5.0,W,very knowledgeable of the material and extremely helpful she will go out of her way to make sure that you succeed in her class
4.5,M,i had him for history of comm and he was so knowledgeable his essays are really particular but as long as you follow directions get a good grade what he talks about in lectures is good info for his essays overall a fairly interesting class
5.0,M,i had terry for mass persuasion and propaganda and absolutely loved him and the class i definitely recommend it
5.0,M,definitely the best professor i had while attending evergreen and art school incredibly helpful and knowledgeable about the art world and a fun professor i feel he really helped my work grow and pushed me as a woman i find him to be anti at all his retirement is a huge loss to the evergreen students
3.0,M,very nice guy his class is just made up of attendance and take home quizzes that are questions for each chapter just do the quizzes during the lecture and show up very very very easy a
1.5,M,is a very dull instructor has practice questions on blackboard which are actually on the tests lets you use a card with notes for each test which helps alot most of the questions come from lecture notes also on blackboard i would not recommend him unless you have no choice he does take attendance via sign in sheet
2.5,M,i would not recommend this teacher to my worse is very boring and to me he does not know what he is talking you ask for tells you that he went over it already and that the notes were on the will totally put you to you have to take this class please do not take this guy
1.5,M,i am sure he is a nice guy but he does not know how to teach he graded one of our lab tests and then i noticed that he had graded unfairly on my test that was the beginning of him being on my bad side he is not prepared whatsoever he would say something and then do another do not hold him to his word drop his not take it from him
2.0,M,doesnt really seem to know what hes talking about he is very nice but the class is unorganized you never know what the test is going to be like you even know what to study you never use the book and he gets off topic and starts talking about his life frequently
4.5,M,was one of the easiest classes i took at chico state for those who complain they must have been really lazy i skimmed chapters and wrote blogs those are his assignments and got an a rob is easy going guy and shows a lot of videos in class open to different opinions
2.5,M,i thought he was a good teacher he explains stuff really well and is available to help
3.5,M,found this class irritating everyday he would tell us to read something and then the next day he would make us discuss it exam was hell he wanted you to memorize specific non-important quotations it seemed found him arrogant but i doubt he has great analytical skills which i picked up in the class too much content on race issues for me
4.5,M,i found dr eberts to a very helpful although at first he may seem hard to approach once you talk to him he is fine his second and third year classes are much better than the first year ones as he is more interested in the subject he is teaching
4.5,W,great teacher gives an easy quiz every class period that is only or questions and she goes over it directly before you take it gives weeks to complete hw assignments very helpful easy
4.5,M,a good teacher class is somewhat boring just listening to his notes but the class is easy we only had one paper three exams the exams are kind of hard but he makes it very clear what you need to know im taking him again next semester because i really liked the class
5.0,W,dr gubacs is a fantastic professor she is a great athlete and does a good job teaching and relating to the student very kind woman and i look forward to taking another course with her in the future
3.5,M,the class is very interesting with movies you would probably never have seen otherwise dr bell is very knowledgeable about the topics but it gets a bit boring his lectures only last about minutes though because you watch a film every class period quizzes are very hard make sure you read
1.0,M,this is by far the worst spanish professor i have ever had and trust me a spanish student i was beyond fluent prior to taking this class and i love this subject he is rude arrogant cuts you off he cares about maintaining his image as a hard professor and all his grading is arbitrary and highly subjective do not take this class
3.0,M,he is very knowledgable quizzes that he really prepare you for but the midterm and final are both in paper form so you can make up for your grade there definitely not an easy class but it is interesting material and the films arent bad
1.5,M,he made me dislike interculural films he is rude cuts students off when he agree with what his students said i would not take this class he does not explain himself well enough for students to understand there are online chats and discussion board topics that are due every class also weekly quizes and page papers due each class
2.0,M,i would not recommend this first year seminar to anyone although the material sounds fun and interesting too much busy work is expected from the course and its a struggle to get a decent grade his lack of clarity when it comes to assignments creates numerous difficulties throughout the year consider this a warning
2.5,M,this class was definitely not what i was expecting for a seminar bell is definitely a hard-ass but if you follow the structure for this class you should be okay just and moan along the way you just have to regurgitate his opinions and if you like a film he want to hear about it so keep your mouth shut
2.0,M,a nice man but old and stuck in his ways he talks soooo slowly that you can barely pay attention and he reads from movie review essays he wrote years ago a nice man but makes film boring and a film student
4.5,M,very pretentious and demanding yet it works out to your advantage he expects you to follow instructions and actually think about what reading his class will make you a better reader and student
3.0,M,panzeralla is focused on his own text books that he has compiled he has no time for students nor helping them i have no idea why he is teaching at all when he has no interest in helping students at all he does not respond to e-mails and if you want a response it is best you cc the dean or chairperson take him
1.0,M,worst professor ever told me i was bound to get a f when i could not withdrawal from the of the students could not do the work due to blackboard outage how am i suppose to pass it with no work to be graded do not take him
1.0,M,do not i repeat do not take this class the professor is the worst i have ever encountered in my life and he has the nerve to call himself an educator he is no help at all i took it online big mistake w the text is very hard to read the discussion board and quizez are set up ensure you get a poor grade blackboard has constant outages
1.0,M,avoid this class might prevent me from graduating never thought a multiply choice test could be so hard or a undergrad text could be so difficult the prof refuse to help if you have any problems and will refer you to the syllabus if you ask him a question the class is a gpa killer
4.5,M,pretty easy tests are questions and one essay he gives hints about what essay question will be dont have to buy textbook short readings no quizzes uses canadian grading scale b etc
5.0,M,an awesome teacher and so nice and he grades on what he calls the canadian scale where start at great
1.5,M,he is very boring and he loves to tell jokes that are not funny it is not helpful at all even if you ask him questions the class and the tests are hard
1.0,M,worst professor i have ever had he answer questions correctly and is useless when it comes to out of class help he is disorganized and does not know the material he teaches
3.0,W,she is an extremly nice lady her teacher is clear sometimes and not others she doesnt teach everything in the homework so get it done before to ask questions she lets you use a cheat sheet for her tests overall if you just do the homework and spend a little time you can easily get a b not to bad of a class gives extra credit to help you
5.0,M,loved this prof he was one of the best i have ever had
2.0,M,milner is not clear at all i would not recommend taking an education calss with him he knows what he is teaching but always changes dates and does not tell you what you need to for the class
3.5,M,hes pretty clear and patient with his students hes a very serious guy and you cant talk in class or that will deff sway your grade trust me is it an easy a no but if you pay attention dont talk go to every class and show a lot of interest and get the moves the way he wants it then it will be
5.0,M,so helpful oh my goodness he finds ways to help me in between lessons i was struggling with my tremolos for months and he said like sentence and that fixed the problem great teacher

4.5,W,i recently finished taking a course w prof is a very good professor who is well prepared for class and brings interesting material to be discussed much of what she teaches can be applied after walking out of class her accent does not effect her teaching ability overall great helpful and understanding professor class recommende
5.0,W,she was very prepared thoughtful and stimulating
1.5,W,understand a word she says i attend any of the classes and manage a b on the exams i suggest not taking a class with this professor if you would like to understand the material the first time its taught

1.0,W,she is awful you will not understand anything from her lectures you will only sleep
3.0,W,the teacher was overall nice but she expects everyone in the class to be going into a journalist field and as such grades quite harshly if you have a strong opinion of your own writing chances are it will be gone by the time done with this class take another english writing class to offset this if this happens
3.0,W,she teaches in a high school style she tends to be unclear yet unrelenting while grading
4.0,M,i took him for both my and good the best professor in sha just go to every class and take notes he told you what the problem will be on the exam before hand the might be a bit tricky tho i managed to got a perfect score on my last exam for he only taught the basic stuff in the textbook recommend
5.0,M,hes great a funny and interesting guy his tests are tough and you have to study hes really personable though and looks out for his students well being hes really friendly and his class isnt too hard
2.5,M,yes he often repeats himself and the class becomes repetitive and boring his lectures are poor he notify students when rude with no reason at you want to learn business take classes somewhere else
3.0,M,i took him for business intro and earned an a now that im taking him for finance and marketing noticed that he often repeats himself and thus the class becomes repetitive and boring at times he has a sense of humor his lectures are fun but never there for office hours and he notify students when absent

3.0,M,this guy knows his stuff for sure but this class is very hard you have to be on top of all the reading and pay attention to every word he says in order to do well on exams the exams are tough and composed of tricky multiple choice and essays he can spot if you unsure in your essays and you will be marked down
4.5,W,laidlaw was an awesome teacher she is very enthusiastic with teaching and brings energy to class every day she grades fair and easy i would take her again if i had the opportunity
5.0,W,i loved this teacher she made the classroom enviornment so comfortable i have never looked forward to a class before i took this one and i hate public speaking the final is what lowered my grade to a b but she gives you a heads up on going to be on it so make sure you study i think she graded the speeches completely fair

4.0,W,nice lady but takes art to an extreme do not take her if not a master in writing papers she acts more like an english teacher than an art teacher at times test are easy if you study and go to class rarely used the book you will learn a lot from her but needs to understand that she is not an english teacher
1.0,W,this woman is extremely rude and hateful the first day i ever attended school at vol state i was lost and sent to her to ask her where i should go for my art class i knocked on her door and she proceeded to rip the door open and tell me off in front of her class for interupting her lecture i was mortified she ruined my first day of college
1.0,M,alright let me justify my rating true a nice guy but where the benefits end sure he gives you test questions but often change them or put new questions you never studied and if you word it correctly wrong lectures are pointless if beyond the first row the books are not easy reading stay away
1.5,M,this class is horrible i am in i right now he does not teach he expects you to read these complicated ethic books and teach yourself and make your own study guides so if you understand it you will fail the tests like half this class hard he is useless as a teacher and clear with what you should study
1.5,M,avoid he may be very intelligent but only someone with bionic ears would be able to hear him speak yes helpful he gives test questions ahead of time because it would be impossible to pass otherwise take philosophy with another professor
5.0,W,mrs mcvey is one of the best math teachers ever known math can be difficult for lots of people but i watched mrs mcvey help even the dumbest person understand what they were doing she is very detailed and picky but it is beneficial to the student she is very fair and respectful of everyone period
4.5,M,mr conrad is a great teacher i am terrible at math and had to take developmental courses all of which i took with conrad he helped me figure it out and as long as you go to class and do the work he gives you the benefit of the doubt a great instructor in college algebra now and when i ask questions he always helps willingly
1.5,M,makes you feel stupid he expects you to already know all the material and does not teach you anything you couldnt read off a powerpoint no book work all online and test are percent of the grade
4.5,W,i think mt johnson is an awesome teacher and is one of the few that really care if you get it or not if you understand speak up and she will help you anyway she can to make sure you understand i say enough good things about her i hate algebra and she helps you get it even when it is hard for got a b and i suck in this area
4.5,W,mrs johnson can get carried away at times and leave the students confused but if you ask questions she will clarify things for you she tries to read expressions but no one is a mind reader if you take her and understand speak up there were tests and a final the lowest grade is dropped
4.5,M,listen to the slackers if you enjoy cj and actually want to learn something novel and challenging and different take his classes he can be challenging but he helps you and attack you like other professors his classes usually mean a lot of reading and discussion but well worth it also his graduate classes are rocking
4.5,M,simply put dr arrigo is the man common sense in a sea of lunacy intelligence in a world of stupidity and someone not afraid to think outside the box instead of grazing with the sheep every graduate class should be like his read or lecture grad students get them to think for themselves dr arrigo gets it
4.0,W,i really have a problem with her its just that she teaches in a very weird way and different from what been taught prior and she treats college algebra like its the most important class you will ever take i take her again
4.0,W,a nice lady but not the best teacher she gets off track and kind of bounces around in her lessons each question on her tests count for a ridiculous amount of points she also seems like one of those people who let things build up then will explode on you if i had to do it over again i take her
5.0,M,very nice guy he will go over everything with you step-by-step he does not give too much homework he is funny in a very dorky way
5.0,W,great professor had her in fall for online course very helpful and kept in touch with emails i would take her again if i could highly recommend her
1.0,W,a sweet woman but lectures were based on opinion and the actual work was online its not fair because if we wanted an online course we would have taken oh well overall dont take her unless you want to be forced into hearing her very biased opinion watching boring films from the and doing everything online
1.5,W,teacher was terrible made a b in the class but nothing of what she says in class will be on the tests or quizzes she has some computer program make them for her and the questions come out of the text she has a attendance policy but i could have made the same grade without ever stepping foot in her class
1.0,W,i hated her class so disorganized and would go off topic very easily quizes were nothing she had said in class tests are online and that was the only good part about it
4.5,W,miss mitchell made my semester i really ought to talk about her knowledgeability and the way she makes the material fun and interesting to the vast majority of disinterested students but all that pales in comparison to my huge crush on her shew yeah she really kills me leave it at that
5.0,M,professor martin covers the material very well and clearly has a passion for it after the first few classes it becomes obvious that he is a computer veteran with enormous amounts of experience he provides a great overall learning experience and many examples from his career for the practical reasons behind material covered great professor
4.0,W,she knows the history very well overall shes an alright person but at times she comes off as tough rude and strict but still her class is helpfull and you will learn alot
4.0,M,good professor not the best teacher but he keeps the class is plenty entertaining and fairly easy
4.5,M,he loves history his passion makes you pay attention in class i find that he assigns way to much reading we use three textbooks on a regular basis and will read a chapter from each throughout the week he expects you to do your work and all of your work so if you tests will be a challenge work is managable really helpful
3.0,W,pretty good assignments the course is laid out well crits are kind of unhelpful and sometimes make sense she is extremely nice however and is very lenient with project definitely a good introduction to have fun hard to go wrong if you put time and thought into your work
4.0,W,class turned out to be way better than i expected there were tough but she is such a nice lady and is always willing to help out students i am definitely taking her again for psyc
3.5,M,i really liked this class i thought the class got easier as it went on he goes over exactly whats going to be on the test the class before also he randomly takes attendance for extra credit and it can really help your grade points the paper is extremely easy definitely reccomend
4.0,M,mr mcgee is so straightforward he gives you all the notes beforehand you barely have to write anything down i never went but studied for every test and i got an a in the class the book project is kind of tedious but not bad once you consider a great professor but whatever you do take this class at will fall go
5.0,M,excellent instructor very helpful and interesting if you put some effort into the class ie attend do the homework do fine he wants people to do well if you are a slacker be prepared to be stressed with the workload i also recommend the fieldtrips class for an activity credit it gives a new appreciation of geology
2.5,M,bob is kinda cool for a older guy his class too hard if you go not the most fun class in the world but i definantly understand the earth a bit more really loves his subject
5.0,M,first let me state that i hate math bob however was the best math teacher i ever had he moves fast and writes a lot of i got it it is the way he explains if anyone get always would spend time after class explaining it until we did get it great teacher
3.0,M,there was an awful lot of him writing on the took up alot of time i thought he was a bit arrogant the only reason i got a c was because i went to a tutoring class with an awesome russian woman whose name i forget i would not take this professor again
5.0,M,awesome luved his class
4.5,M,great professor show up listen and study the work he is young at heart and very fun makes math interesting
1.0,W,i am a great student and and the most difficult time with her class she rambled on and on about nothing relevant her tests are ridiculously hard the class consists of tests a paper and attendance if you did poorly on assignment there was no hope for raising your grade do not take her
4.0,W,she makes attendance mandatory when not at all also the coursepack you need for the class i only looked at it once or twice the whole semester read the books and know about the authors you will get an a bring other hw to this class or else you will fall asleep
4.0,M,i really liked dr f he explains things in class i agree with the person that said he kinda expects you to already know it he put all homework and quizzes online easy class if you can put enough effort into the online hw
2.0,M,his class is very boring he does not teach you he read to you and you must teach yourself he does not read the lab until he get into class he will mark off for things he did not ask for on labs and tests he is unorganized and has lost labs
3.0,M,he is very monotone but he prepares you for is tests they key is showing up to class everyday printing off the powerpoint notes take notes as he is talking and study like crazy i got an a and his tests were mostly fill-in the blank as long as you study your heart out it does not matter who the teacher is you will get an a
4.0,W,this professor is extremely easy helpful laid back and considerate of students being adults with busy lives beware that she makes everybody be socialable and participate so if you prefer to keep to yourself quietly you might have tough time attendance affects your grade with her but other than that its a very easy class
3.0,M,very all over the place he likes to tell stories and unfunny a nice man and seems to care about the student he gives you study guides before the tests but some of the things on the test on the guide take lots of notes and read the text
3.0,M,he loves what he teaches funny teaches until the last second his lectures are scattered around sometimes very nice and always willing to help you or answer any questions tests are pretty hard in my opinion do not just study the study guide he gives you study everything notes diagrams and book info overall great teacher o
3.5,M,so i took him for several classes and i always dropped him he goes too slow and repeats the same stories in every single class he made sleepy he also skips around on the subjects too so i could not organize the info in my head you have to be there his tests come straight from the notes write down everything he says
5.0,M,dr frank loves to teach and it shows he goes at a pace where everyone can keep up if anyone has a problem he will take the time to help i had him for both lab lecture and would definetly take him again
5.0,M,dr frank loves to teach and it shows he goes at a pace where everyone can keep up if anyone has a problem he will take the time to help i had him for both lab lecture and would definetly take him again
5.0,M,he was very helpful but hard to listen to as his voice is monotone i do like him and would reccomend him
3.5,W,tough but awesome helped me realize i love biology with a passion too but be surprised if she picks favorites by the first test though how she weeds out her class and finds her star pupils
4.0,M,this class involves a lot of reading in class you grade yourself on how well you prepared for that day you actually do that quite often his grading scale is not the regular scale a is an a and a is a b he chooses favorites it was an alright class but i really get anything out of it
4.0,M,he is very passionate about his subject area and loves for students to be enthusiastic he wants everyone contributing in class discussions he definitely has favorites and even though i was one of them it made me very uncomfortable you do as well if you have a different opinion than he does which is not fair he really cares about the cl
1.5,W,gives vaugue instructions for the submission of assignments that may appear in vaious places will give over half the class a zero if her pet instruction followed futhermore there a clear grading ruprick so you will never know how she will grade not a pleasent experience
5.0,W,mrs moore is a great teacher she is always happy too keyboarding is a breeze for me i key apprx wpm making an easy a in this class the assignments are super easy but you have to do them everynight or you will get behind just like with any class study tests are easy love this teacher take her if you can fun

3.0,W,the world of chemistry comes easy to ms hunter and she give the impression that it should come easy to everyone she is fair to students but has little patience if you understand what she is explaining or if you are taking too long in lab for someone who is starting back to college after years out a tough teacher to start off w
3.0,W,she didnt teach much most of the class was spent watching a video or going through powerpoints then gave an in-class assignment based on them tests were the exact same questions as on the homework so just memorize them and you should get an easy a on the exams also allowed us to skip the final if we did well on the first tests take for ez a
3.5,M,i do agree that he did not really ever go over anything in the book and then his tests were based solely on the book extremely difficult not knowing what to look for to study however most of the semester is spent on obtaining actual speech experience expect to spend a lot of time in front of the class talking pretty good teacher though
4.0,M,i would reccomend him for anyone if you pay attention you will see the big picture of his class i learned alot of life lessons i would take him again if i had the chance
5.0,W,she was one of the best teachers i have had in a long time i really appreciated how she gives you an assignment schedule you will do very well if you read the chapters and do not procrastinate seriously when you get to midsemester things really start to move quickly
5.0,M,mmmmmmm he is hot fun interesting and easy class
3.0,W,yes she is very knowledgable however is also condescending at times is known for embarrasing students in front of entire class and i wrote more essays in her communication class than i did in both of my eng classes would not recommend her she teaches communications but does not communicate how does that work
5.0,M,oh my goodness if you get an a in this class you have no one to blame but yourself he is enthusiastic about the material and knows his stuff everything is very clear about what is expected and when--all you have to do is do it online practice quizzes make tests easy i recommend him to everyone
5.0,M,wow what can be said about mr e greatest professor he and i are good friends and i still deejay at wvcp
4.0,W,is really cool she is very nice but i think she requires too much busy work she told us we would only have presention and we had to do throughout the semester
1.0,W,she is horrible please do not take her she makes you take tests over chapters and you have to have a passport which is money down the drain so many people dropped the class and failed
1.0,W,she was a horrible teacher and always gave too much work and reading passport and chapters at a time for a test she is horrible
2.5,W,you can go never go to this class a day in your life and be just the same she uses my mathlab which i found to be very annoying i spent hours on homework in the semester which only accounts for of your overall grade i spent another hours on quizzes which are of your grade so unless you have a ton of time i wouldnt take her

3.0,W,she is kind of scatterbrained and unorganized but she will go out of her way to help you if you are having problems with the language
3.5,M,gives a rough first impression to be honest i hated him after the first class but as i got to know him he is a great instructor a little hard to understand as he is from nigeria but overall not that big of a deal as long as you try to write a good paper you have any problems with him he does not like flashy papers keep it simple
3.5,W,the easiest teacher ever she cancels a lot of classes definitely an easy a class is a joke highly recommend taking her
1.0,W,judy navas is under-qualified as a professor at ssu as a fine arts instructor a certain degree of literacy is expected and ms navas seems to be void of such ability constant spelling errors and grammatical mishaps in her essay prompts mispronunciation of words and a disappointing level of difficulty has made her class unbearable avoid

5.0,W,if everyone approached life as she does we would have a better world and minority group should be a mandatory class for every major maybe then we would learn tolerance for others and thier cultures and not be so closed minded we are in college where we should all have open minds to new things how else can you grow as a person
4.0,M,funny guy which always helps in keeping the attention of the students especially in lecture fairly easy grader but tough subject overall if you do your job as a student go above and beyond his job as a teacher to ensure that you comprehend this tricky subject recommended

3.0,M,a fun course but wow the lectures are dull too bad because he seems so into what saying but the vast majority of his lectures are from the textbook still he knows what talking about and posts the notes online thank goodness some slides hold multiple paragraphs worth taking his class but bring along a coffee
1.5,M,i once even saw his fall asleep and then wake up at the end drooling he puts everyone asleep

2.5,M,he gets bored with his own lectures and dismisses class early you only need the access code really no point in buying the book since you can get the code separately he tries to tell jokes i think he realizes laughing at him not with him but whatever overall easy class to pass worth putting up with strangeness
1.0,W,i took this class because it was suposed to be a fun class and you would learn alot about international business dr carnes made it not fun all you do in that class is read the text books and talk about it she will put you down if you get the answer wrong her tests are hard i was very disapointed with the class

5.0,M,he is a very great professor but very hard he makes the class very interesting if you have to take anatomy you should definitely take him for anatomy anatomy will be a breeze i love the class but have had to neglect my other classes to do good in his everything comes from the notes if you make note cards save them for the final
5.0,M,really really great professor he keeps things interesting and likes to gross the girls out if you talk text etc do his best to embarrass you if you want an easy a do not take this class if you want to learn this class is the best if you understand something work hard to get you to understand
2.0,M,he is not nearly as helpful as he thinks he is he is also not someone you want in your corner as he is two faced
1.0,M,i took this course in the summer and dr albright was terrible he was definitely not teaching at an undergraduate level i recommend taking ac with him
1.0,M,he is not a good teacher he helped write the text book that we used and he loved talking about writing it he did not teach at an intro level and was not helpful when you had questions i would not recommend him to anyone
2.0,M,he typically has tests the first test is literally over book adn the test over a book he does let you use a study guide with the test but in a min class the test would have questions meaning if you had to think about a question for more than seconds you had to turn your test in incomplete hated this teacher
1.0,M,he is ridiculous i always attend class and am still completely this research paper is the hardest thing i have to thus far in my yrs not for people who need a clear depiction of whats required of you
3.5,M,i thought he was ok and kind of nice yes he does come at the subject from a unique point of view that i agree with and it was obvious that he thought a lot of himself but he made sure the tests covered exactly what was learned you need to read the book to do well on the tests and you need to attend lecture to do well on the essays
4.5,M,this class itself can be difficult especially if you have no prior experience in programming but all around scripps is a excellent professor he makes the class fun and he is really laid back
5.0,M,the class is not rating the class rating scripps and he is the man
4.0,M,i had this course a while ago he is a great guy but expect to work a a had a little bit of programming experience before and still had some difficulty now years later i am good at java i can see how this class could be a blast i really feel like i learned from him until the end of the semester though
4.0,M,if you like this guy taking yourself and your studies too seriously completely avoids bs rules such as attendance solid deadlines mandatory class participation etc however he is a hard paper grader you just write a bs paper and get an a if you slack off get a b if you can write well get an a

5.0,W,great teacher easy homework assignments flexible paper due dates class is a bit boring and really no need to attend to get an she takes attendance everyday so i would def go everyday overall great teacher

4.0,M,by far the best professor i have had yes-there is a lot of work and yes the class is hard but he goes above and beyond trying to do what he can to help his students understand he gives lots of extra credit and help he has a great way of relating to his students he is passionate about what he does and his work reflects that
2.5,M,ok this teacher was extremely not helpful at all his powerpoint lectures provided would always have mistakes in them confusing the students on how to work the problem correctly teacher was easy to get a hold of but if you got a problem wrong because of his error tough luck

3.0,W,people seem to either love or hate her she knows her psychology but she tends to at her students and she know my name until more than half way through the semester she did bring in some great speakers though
5.0,W,this class was a tough one but if you were dedicated and did the work it too bad she gave detailed explanations on what you did wrong and how you could improve on projects she was also very helpful when i came and saw her she understood my problems with group members and worked with me to fix them beware-she will talk your head off

3.0,M,frampton is a great guy his class is hilarious and if you actually go to class an pay attention you will learn a lot his tests are multiple choice but you have to put time in studying for them the essays are really easy too all you need is pages and a really nice cover page and get an a
2.5,M,easy class attendance is not necessary at all he talks a lot n makes some jokes which can be disturbing sometimes but funny his test can be hard but the papers you have to write r a joke he grades them basically on the appearance of ur cover page if you want to learn anything about marketing tho this is not the class
3.5,M,alright prof he speaks softly so sit closer to him pretty boring but his exam is fair i did alright on his section he gets questions x weeks teaching i read textbook for his section as his notes arent fantastic

2.5,M,really really dislike paulo ego takes up entire lecture hall jokes around at students expense all class read arabian nights wonderful material however he give more than a c to anyone who mentioned in any of their work should be valid in arabian nights as almost all women are s picks favs very unfair avoid
4.5,M,i had from war and though it was occasionally boring it was still a good class if you fill out the study guides then you will ace the tests and the test is easy as long as you know the info he has fascinating stories to tell that add interest to the class he taught a class on revelation at my church and i loved it
4.5,W,i loved this class she is my favorite teacher ever i am taking her next semester as well she is always open for help and gives us more time if we need it she is a little silly but that is what keeps us laughing it is my favorite class to go to
5.0,W,her class is a little bit of a challenge lots of memorization but she is the coolest teacher she makes class enjoyable and humorous most of the time she even plays movies of some of the stories
1.0,W,page paper from is very biased and if she hates you give you a bad great dont waste your time in this class
5.0,W,she is a great she a great teacher her class is not hard at all very funny and extremely caring the quizes are every friday to review for the week and she drops the lowest grade you play jeopardy for extra credit she puts underlying theory to practice lol take her class
4.5,W,hebrew bible taking care of my ger and she is making it great other reviews are old so listen to me this lady is a real sweetheart slightly intimidating at first but that vanishes quizzes on fridays are straightforward two short simple papers as well has a sense of humor and is a little cutie take her again
4.0,W,i love this woman yep scatteredbrain but oh well amazing and really cares about the subject get to know her outside of the classroom and you regret it she is one of my fave profs and be taking more courses with her next semester
4.0,M,nice guy if you have questions just ask he is someone you really want to put in your the future so behave in class
4.5,M,if you can follow his classes you will remember them he does diverge but most of the important features of the discussion come through understanding these one sided his view is the other side and he does explain both not liberal just does not force feed you his views of the school are obvious obervations
2.5,M,i know how people can say hes good his tests are the review changed but its still not understandable at all nothing but tests count towards ur grade had no idea what i was doing in his class really brought down my gpa
4.0,W,sound informative and very interesting does bring family home life into class but always puts them in context of lessons being taught love her
5.0,M,prof colasurdo is an awesome professor i just loved his class he is a great teacher and he is definitely not boring has a great sense of humor
4.0,W,a great teacher she encourages class discussion and taught fairly well considering it was her first time teaching the course tons of reading real is a take home very fair grader when it comes to essays and always willing to help
2.5,M,i think he higher ratings because girls tend to think cute an okay teacher definitely not the best in the department but i think a bit full of himself and pretty rude
2.0,M,this prof seems great at first but ends up being terrible he has one funny joke a class but the rest is just rambling for he takes so much time telling stories when the test comes around you are clueless stay away from this professor
3.0,M,he is a great professor he teaches somewhat fast but is honestly there to help you he will make the class doable as long as you do your part by far best teacher in the economics department
4.0,M,he is a really nice guy if you try hard in his class and stay on top of the assignments he asks of you then you will seriously do well try to get on his good side it pays off he is a really smart guy and is very willing to help you out if you need go to office hours it makes him take you seriously and you learn a lot from his genius
4.0,M,take advantage of extra credit opportunities and office hours there is a lot of material but the tests ask about broad trends and general connections so just memorizing that helpful he is kind of a picky grader field trips are kind of random but fun and he has a lot of jokes and interesting stories so the class is laid back and fun
3.0,M,such a funny guy love him he is a genius and is a bit confusing when he talks about the subject matter he is really into what he teaches as long as you try hard in the class you will do well even if you do bad on exams show effort that you care about the class and meet with him though if you dont understand
2.5,M,the whole time i thought i was going to fail and even considered withdrawing after basically failing all the impossible exams however he gives so many extra credit opportunities that only require your attendance and he makes group projects worth a ton so i actually ended up doing well in the class his grades seem subjective just try hard
5.0,M,my favorite professor at cofc he is brilliant gives very interesting lectures and is an all around great guy i wish i had more history credits remaining so i could take him again
4.5,M,great professor his class easy but you learn a bunch which is the why you pay to go to school right really helpful when you ask him questions in and out of class has a great sense of humor definitely would recommend
4.0,W,i took her for intro to american studies she gives a mini-quiz every week and you have one pages paper presentation to do its not that bad she is nice although she does keep you till the end of class
2.5,M,you have no choice if you want to be an em major you have to have him as your teacher two times either switch majors or suck it up yeah he gives entirely too much busy work but easy you just have to memorize class work for tests just do what he says be fine
4.5,M,if you go to class and do the assigned work you will most likely get an a dr r is absolutely not as bad as everyone else is saying the class is fine he is a nice guy and not hard to do good
4.0,M,while he is the very image of the aloof professor he is fantastic guiding students through highly dense materially and demanding as much of himself as his students probably the hardest course i have taken on a day-to-day basis but also one of the most rewarding
1.0,W,everyone who thinks this woman is brilliant is horribly mistaken her lectures consist of run-on sentences composed of adjectives which are similes of each other this passage is strange mysterious illuding conspiratory if that is what it means to be brilliant then brilliant is the last thing i would ever want to be
1.0,W,she was never actually in the class the tas were good about helping but i had zero contact with prof iten all semester
1.0,W,she is rude and unwilling to offer any excuse being an international student i was totally lost in her class she is a strict lady which is nice but i dont think anyone feels comfortable in her class please avoid her class at all costs
1.0,M,i took several of his classes and i wish i had found this site found him to be extremely scatterbrained there were several times i had to go talk to him about an essay topic and he kept changing my topic and adding things until even i was confused he would then get upset with me for the changes he made he blames students for his faults
2.0,M,dishonourable treatment of students there should be punitive measures for his behaviour
1.0,M,decent enough for undergrad courses but an absolute nightmare for graduate work will constantly blame you for stuff he demanded in his revisions very unorganized have much knowledge on the graduate thesis process i have sincerely regretted choosing him as my advisor he will try to keep you there as long as possible for funding
4.0,M,awesome prof irvine is a very nice caring and passionate prof he is very interesting to listen to if you ever go to his office hours such a nice guy he is very patient and makes sure you leave his room happy and confident in the material highly recommend taking this course for gpa boosters and having him as a prof
5.0,M,you need to attend his lectures but if you have time you should check it out but if you read from the book and you should be fine the subject was easy and the quizzes were fair the average for our class was so if planning on getting some ez credits definitely recommend him
5.0,M,very good at getting his message across in class manages to make a relatively boring topic semi-interesting you really need to go to class though everything is in the textbook going to class does help to clarify
4.0,M,definetly knows his stuff go to class even though the same info is in the text midterms and final are hard study your butt off many people take the class many times will help you if you need help he makes the class interesting with his little stories
5.0,M,he is excellent he knows his stuff makes it interesting shows ads and example throughout the semester to make it interactive all-in-all he is great professor and i hope i get to take him again
1.0,M,on a power they run the computer labs like he does in redchina communism comes to the to his profession
5.0,M,hands down my favorite prof at snider is hilarious and he makes the material fun and interesting to learn for once i was actually looking forward to chem instead of dreading it
5.0,M,i am a senior now and taylor has been by far my favorite professor the classes are well structured and he gave up plenty of class time to get projects done instructor taylor encouraged me to develop ideas but if i was stuck he was always able to help his classes set up a solid foundation for any art student
4.5,M,he does a good job teaching photoshop and will give input when asked he does take role and you must attend the lab to turn in your photos
4.5,W,took behavioural neuro with her and awesome willing to help with anything not an easy course but if you work hard do okay
4.0,W,okay i am taking my third class with her got to agree with the majority at first she was my least favorite teacher and i found her you get the picture but i ended up with an a and a in the two prior classes taken with her and you really do start to understand her teaching methods
1.5,M,not a great all he is funny sometimes but it would be more useful to hear information on the class rather than how many friends we have
4.0,M,excellent professor focused and detailed in all of his lectures passionate about the field and expresses this in his lectures
1.0,W,uses intimidation to control students is more concerned about personal time than helping students most students in her class do not enjoy going because she is demonstrative and rude my advise is to take another teacher because it is clear that she is just collecting a paycheck there are much better teachers at the school
4.5,W,dr estrada is an extremely helpful teacher she keeps spanish fun and makes you want to learn the material although sometimes a little too peppy in the morning she always knew how to keep the class exciting she knows her stuff and i would recommend her to anyone
5.0,W,dr e is by far the best professor i have ever had she helps you understand the spanish languages so well and she is very very nice i high suggest taking her if you have the chance she spends so much of her time helping you its crazy
3.5,M,peters is a nice guy his office is open a lot if you need to ask questions his classes involve a lot of reading lectures almost everyday a short paper a research paper and about exams which are challenging but not impossible
4.5,M,you can tell he loves the material and it is boring sometimes but this class was definitely really cool he made the tests so easy you get a cheat sheet for every one so theres no way to not get a good mark he takes test material right out of the book and only does more challenging math on assignments which he will help you do if you ask
1.0,W,online her directions are clear as mud she counts off for seemingly random things with no explanation or prior warning does not respond to questions and is very rude if she responds to anything this course was insanely writing intensive essays a week and the tests were over unimportant details or not in the book at all avoid at all costs
5.0,W,great professor she did not say we should not critique the readings just asked us to do it respectfully
5.0,W,dr farrer is the best professor at cal i highly recommend taking any course you can with her she is very thorough and clear with what she expects excellent experience
5.0,W,i took an online course from dr farrer i learned a lot and she is very helpful i am working on a and would definitely recommend this program to my friends
3.5,M,staggeringly intelligent very funny and kind professor fogel is wonderful albeit very scatterbrained his grading varies from fair to hard expect an a on either of the papers he assigns sometimes hard to understand what questions you should be asking and his answers always make things any clearer but he is a great professor
4.5,M,words cannot describe the love that i have for this man-he is my hobby-horse but seriously his methods of teaching are extremely sophisticated and innovative and i recommend him to anyone who seeks alternative teaching methods especially in english
5.0,M,nice teacher and he explains everything
4.0,W,she is awesome if you do your work and come to class you will do fine she truly cares about her students seton hall needs more professors like her listen to the person who said awful because they are the type that probably didnt do the work and still expected an a
4.5,W,bottom line charisse is a great women her classes are fun but intense you will learn alot
4.5,W,absolutely love her she is so down to earth and will tell you like it is which some people like need gives a few simple assignments and is there whenever you need her had her for this class and orientation to edu and i will take her any chance i get
5.0,W,once again the bestprofessor ever this women is an amazing professor who gets her students involved so much in class that you sometimes dont even realize ur learning something i would definitly say that you need to take her classes because its well worth it definitly ganna be keepin in touch with her because she is such a great help
5.0,M,professor walker is awesome he gives good explanations and examples and he seems enthusiastic at every class before class he played classic rock music attendance is important and this class requires work but if you put in the proper amount of time you will do well in his class
3.0,M,prof walker is a good teacher i feel like really hard to understand what he is actually trying to say most of the time though however if you read the book and actually study and try to understand vs memorize the material you will be fine if you put effort into the class get an bc the tests extremely hard conceptually
5.0,M,walker is the way to go for econ clear explanations and his tests are much more straightforward than self or olsen who love to throw in trick questions i had econ prior to taking this class and thought he made it pretty interesting go to cl do the workbook questions and do well
2.5,M,great teacher funny guy and his workbook helps so much everyone who takes olsen regrets it take walker not olsen great class and pretty easy to get a good grade if you put in the time doing practice problems and practice tests in his workbook
2.0,M,everyone seems to give him good ratings but in my experience he been especially helpful or clear he obviously knows what talking about but moves too quickly and seems to be at teaching such a large class if you work hard in his class do well but expect him to be as awesome as everyone says he is
4.5,W,i thought that her poetry class was really fantastic-she really pushed us to do our best work and taught me a lot about understanding and writing poetry
1.0,W,just a very rude person why mrs greig fire her and find a better representation of the nursing program is beyond me sure good at what she does but there are many people out there that could do just as well with a better attitude
1.0,W,could not have been less helpful if her job description read completely ignore students or make them wish you had
5.0,W,loved her she was so helpeful and always gave me the best advice on writing my papers and how to improve them she was just wonderful her class was also really fun and i surprisingly enjoyed doing the highly suggest having her as one of your teachers really like her
5.0,W,very nice lady very helpful almost annoyingly organized but you can always know your grade if you send her an e-mail the way she talks is sometimes annoying but the class is so easy worth putting up with that
4.5,M,reimer is awesome his class is extremely easy he has no tests and all you have to do to pass the class is show up total work for this class is question quizes and labs easiest college class you will take i lifted weights every single class period a nice guy and care what you do at all strongly recommend him
5.0,M,i think i did really poor on the online stuff so i got a b but pretty easy class he sits on the bikes upstairs the whole time
5.0,W,wonderful professor smart as a whip and funny too material may seem impossible but she makes it easy to digest attendance is mandatory you can miss a few days grades are split between class participation blog posts and papers no tests
2.5,W,very dry took her class because of the good ratings if you are going to be taking english do it with her
4.5,M,i had a fantastic experience with prof harris extremely nice and i learned a lot about writing from him also had a fair bit of interesting life that always remember and helped his students maintain perspective overall an excellent prof and i highly recommend for
4.5,M,extremely helpful he expects a lot and digresses a lot but i learned so much from him take his classes if you can
1.5,M,for a guy who get his own poetry published this guy was pretty tough on other peoples art what we learned were his prejudices about poetry and how to write representational poetry he needs to realize that anyone who does the work is really trying to be creative and be sensitive to how hard it is to put personal stuff out there like that
4.0,W,the class was interesting learned a lot about different qc faculty research interests which helped me discover my own research pursuits she is extremely accessible by email or by meeting before or after class a research topic that interests you is chosen and a pg paper and presentation is based on that a great intro to the world of research
4.0,W,she seems nice and sweet but shde is really not very unclear about research useless class at all just need it because it looks good on transcript total waste of time
5.0,W,she is really sweet made it clear what she expected from students brought in department heads to talk to us about their research so that we could see what we would potentially be interested in i learned alot about how to conduct research i how to find a research mentor and start working in a lab final presentation term paper are reasonable
4.5,W,makes terms more easy she takes her time explaining the subject slow paced yet she tends to repeat herself a bit go to class and just listen to her she is great slides are clear textbook not so much but does help in dire needs she will make u understand chemistry like never before
5.0,M,superior teaching style much of the way i teach now is allotted to him
4.5,M,he is a very easy professor i do not think i ever made below an a he did have some health complications recently he was always helpful to me
5.0,M,dr s is getting a bad wrap i must admit i graduated a few years ago now fact is the reason he gave up making class managed is because he got so many complaints about his class being to hard it really broke his spirit i am currently a student in neuroscience and he prepared me well you have to get on his level and listen
2.5,M,physio--you need the book for any of his classes he posts study questions online and if you memorize them you will know at least half or more of the test he curves every test you have to attend class but every time you do and he passes a roll sheet around you get a of a bonus point added to your final grade and he is hilarious
3.0,M,very sweet professor he knows math analysis like the back of his hand his tests are not difficult at all he includes proof on his tests which i think is unfair because a lot of non math majors are required to take the class smart professor with an accent but it doesnt effect lectures he cuts slack for the programming quizzes every week
1.0,M,do not take this professor all his notes are word by word from the book not helpful at all assigns a lot of homework and then know how to answer questions about it
3.5,M,well i got an a in and i recommend this teacher i recommend someone on exams he drops the final if you need to take and there is no else to take just wait a quarter and take someone else he goes over the material well but the tests are harder not recommended
3.0,M,look im gonna be kind of weird yes but hes a pretty good ability to teach is not what makes this class his ability to is an extremely hard grader and requires every decimal point to be other users tests are harder then your not bad at math avoid
2.5,M,i agree his tests are totally harder than what he teaches in class and the homework he gives us
4.0,W,intro to myths and rituals is one of my favorite classes prof myscofski is fair engaging and knows what she is talking about spoiler alert we watched star trek in class whether interested in the topic or not she presents the material well and the assignments are manageable
3.0,M,he was an okay professor i agree there was really no point to go to lectures and most of the teaching was done in section if you can learn from the book then not that bad otherwise having a good ta helps i had jeanine batterton she was really helpful and i highly recommend her
3.0,W,he was an okay professor i agree there was really no point to go to lectures and most of the teaching was done in section if you can learn from the book then not that bad otherwise having a good ta helps i had jeanine batterton she was really helpful and i highly recommend her
1.0,W,creative leadership seminar absolutely aweful class was tense and stressfull as she was always yelling at peoplein front of the class making people cry and over all being very offensive take anything the wrong way and start yelling at the class didnt learn anything especially not about creativity or leadership
1.0,W,she needs a new career some psych help or both she bases grades on whether or not she personally likes you her classes do really stupid things and have structure she yelled at me in front of everyone for things like bringing a newspaper to class wearing heels and mispronouncing some random word f up your college career with this one
1.0,M,trust him he said kept saying not to worry about the first two tests cause if you get an a on the final then you get an a in class only problem where did that final come from study everything and for every test
2.5,M,well they dont call him chainsaw chambers for nothing not very clear on what he wants you to study he emphasizes not using the book and only listening to him but his notes can be kind of confusing got a on the first test a on the test and a on final walked away with a c class averages were similar to those grades
5.0,W,if you dont take this class with her you are missing out on so much class participation is a must so be prepared to do whatever wacky thing she tells you do all the assignments not a push over but not mean either tough but so sweet at the same time take this class with mcafee you will not regret it
1.0,M,wow i recomend everyone take a class with him for the experiance alone its amazing that they let this guy teach at a university scsu is a joke for keeping this guy i asked a question in class and he reponded did you read the book times
1.0,M,this class was unbarable i cannot discribe in words how horrible of a person this man is he is by far the worst teacher in the world i did not learn one thing and if you ask him questions in class he tells you that your dumb and a baby i lost my mind in this class litteraly verge of tears entering his class room please save your selve
1.0,M,extremely bad teacher know how to teach and makes fun of you in front of the whole class doesnt speak english very well either spends more than half the period talking about his life and yells at u if u waste class time on talking to a class mate for help do not take him very badddddd
5.0,M,take him he really loves what he teaches and very very funny never boring very helpful with tests and grades easy its helpful to read the chapters to understand his notes only do about segments from the entire book but seriously take him second guess it no homework other than reading take him
5.0,M,he is a wonderful professor very helpful and easy to learn from if you have a choice take a class with allen
3.5,M,took the online course and would recommend this class to anyone who needs it as long as you read your text you will do fine he gives weekly chapter quizzes and has four term papers to turn in all unit exams are given online so that makes it easy if you have a hard time going to campus study hard for his tests because they can be tricky
4.5,M,hard class but only if you study uses powerpoints and videos explains things well tells some jokes in class likes to give quizes over material covered helpful professor in this class which is lab and lecture he gives a break about halfway thru hr class very challenging class only cuz taking other classes
5.0,M,this was a hard class and i had to spend a lot of time studying but it was all worth it a wonderful teacher and i would take him again if given the chance as long as you study for this class there is no way you could fail
4.0,M,exams mid term and final take notes in class and read the text book days before exams easy a mid-term was so easy that i believe he curved down i see anyone getting lower than make sure you attend the two classes before the mid-term and final he will tell you what to study material he teaches is very theory
2.0,M,this professor is a total flake he barely understands economics his lectures are incomprehensible and he is just an overall joke if you go to class and then read the book you will be fine for the tests but beware if you get a between a and you will be getting a b my overall score was an and he said he had to curve down bs
4.0,M,he is a good prof but big on apa format you will have journal entries but can email him to look over handing in overall interesting class
2.0,M,he is a nice enough man he knows his stuff well he very interesting or very structured but he does teach the class as a college course should be taught no points given except for tests and quizzes but he does curve quite a bit i might say i liked him as a person but never again as a prof
2.5,M,extremely difficult gen ed for a non science-minded person he is very knowledgable but gets off track easily and his teaching style is not appropriate for a gen ed tests are very difficult with multiple choice options for each question he is a nice man understanding and willing to help outside of class but i would avoid this class
2.0,M,he knows pretty much everthing about the topic but most of the time you are just lost he gets of topic really easy if you like to study for hours before every test be fine if not this is not a class for you has about multiple choice possibilities for each question
4.0,M,easiest math class you could possibly take he gives you the test questions and then lets you retake the tests if you dont like your score he is really nice
4.5,M,a little quirky but generally a very sweet guy and great teacher not good at math but very approachable and will answer any questions you have over break or offce hours obviously very passionate about math take him if you have the chance
4.0,W,get me wrong i love dr lorden to death and a really sweet funny lady but the amount of work she assigns is beyond ridiculous every night you have to take quizzes as well as around pages of reading in addition to that frequent busywork assigned the material was not that difficult though
3.5,W,i know how she is getting all these great got an a but she is the most obnoxious professor ever had sweet as can be as a person but all over the place she is so hyper it really gets annoying after the first few lit review was the biggest waste of time of my have to do a million study write ups
2.0,M,this class was history intellectual thought and philosophy there is a reason his classes never fill up and of the class drops on week two you would think your in a phd program and not hist any other teacher is an easy a with effort you will not get an a in this class
4.5,M,i loved my honors seminar class with him the material we read was very interesting we had to read a lot and were writing papers every week a lot of work but the knowledge you gain is incredible really makes you think of course sometimes tell you a bit tmi but he really tries to connect with his class you read long novels
4.5,M,eric is a true intellect his classes show that history contains an interpretive aspect he is unique and enjoyable do the work be prepared to engage in conversation and listen all opinions and comments drive the conversation in different directions but dr ruckh has a way making all comments relevant i recommend his courses to everyone i know
5.0,M,mr opening questions were always brilliant case in point his opening question for the illiad why are these men fighting along with gisela berns the best tutor in st johns my only regrets at st johns not choosing his wittgenstein preceptorial and missing the chance to enroll in his nietzsche preceptorial ah st johns
4.0,M,dr hupp was great he made the lectures fun and really interesting gives great examples in the notes if you come to class and pay attention you will do fine exams usually have a few points i would definitely recommend his class
5.0,M,dr hupp is one of the funniest professors at siue he makes class fun and you learn a lot
2.5,W,she thinks very highly of herself very approachable and an extremely hard marker she also very obviously picks favorites would not recommend this class unless you have a strange obsession with century lit
4.0,W,i was not interested in art at all coming into class but now i love it she makes everything so interesting and has a sense of humor while teaching it shes really nice but you have to come to class and participate dont buy the textbook amazing class i recommend taking it but be ready to write essays for the exams
2.5,W,prof shaw was average in most areas however she respond to my e-mails and she seem particularly enthused about helping a brotha out it is unlikely that she will make much of an impression on you either positive or negative
4.0,M,he is tough but if you want to learn his the way to go he is very helpful outside of the classroom also one of two best professors had at rit
4.5,W,great professor always has a smile and is willing to help she does a really good job at breaking up material to make it easier to understand but easy to fall behind if you miss class do the practice problems from the study sheet before the exam
2.5,M,he is very specific of what he wants but tell you anything he grades with a letter grade and decides your grade based on how he feels at the time he has no legit way of grading
4.5,M,an invested and intelligent professor his classroom is casual and socratic his manner is relaxed and discussive he is a little disorganized but makes up for it with his passion for seeing his students grasp the material
2.0,W,extremely harsh and arbitrary grader she does lie in this case about provides little to no help despite student requests unclear about grading and assignment requirements despite seemingly clear assignment descriptions syllabus etc
4.0,M,this guy took me a while to figure out but after a few weeks i was completely sold his classes and wisdom actually helped me in my personal life and a lot of the reading he assigned is some of my favorite literature now he is the kind of professor that makes me feel better about paying a gajillion dollars a term in tuition
5.0,M,phenomenal instructor he knows contracts and he knows the ucc he just teach theory he teaches the class in a practical realistic way and he forces us to think the same way done more than most profs to show me how the law and lawyers work in the real world
2.0,M,contracts-had no book focus on the ucc and the restatement buy crunch time to follow the course and to do practice problems skim over the cases to understand what concepts and what part of hte ucc and the rst he will go over in class do not focus on the cases
3.0,W,yasger is a very liberal person and wants to have a good time she jokes alot is loud but makes an immpression unfortunately one day she was gone and we were told something happened and she left our class personally she teach an english class more like a debate class i recommend taking her if your looking to learn eng
3.0,W,sarah is a very enthusiastic teacher and she does let you get your thoughts out but she really has issues with getting off topic i get really frustrated with how little we actually end up covering in one class period i feel that if she could only get her style of teaching more disciplined she could be great
1.5,W,sarah is a great person and a very easy grader but that make her a good teacher although she did know what she was talking about she never really passed that knowledge on to the majority of the class everything i learned was through my pla in sections there was also a huge amount of difficult reading
5.0,M,super easy never thought i would get an a in stats tests are open book open computer plus he give a test review with all the answers test questions straight from review easy
2.0,M,for a lower division class he takes it too seriously tests are essays one essay about a book which isnt too bad quizzes on the textbook are ridiculous he has i believe and picks very specific topics which we dont even go over during lectures which are so boring his grades is a bit tough considering this is a ge class
1.5,M,he uses too many power points and then you get overwhelmed with too much general info and no clarity on specifics that you will be tested on
4.0,M,overall his class was not hard but it definitely be taken lightly he tells you ahead of time what the question are for the final so preparing is all up to you the quizzes are from the book so reading is mandatory he likes to reward those that attend class with extra credit points or a sneak peek of quiz no reason not to take his class
2.0,W,if you want an easy a take this teacher she a very good teacher but the material is pretty easy that you can learn it yourself homework is extra credit just take her

1.0,M,amazed at the good comments i had him a few years he was horrible rude to the students and just a huge jerk i would never ever take another class with him again ever
4.5,M,recommend taking japanese from avdulov if you are actually interested in learning the language and are willing to put in the time and effort that requires his classes are always fun and interesting and if you work hard you will learn a lot honest and if you do poorly let you know
5.0,M,is the best i think language is a thing that you have to work hard and he well helps to do it
4.5,W,great teacher really connects with the class and makes any topic enjoyable does require some work here and there but it is worth it to have her as a professor just do your work and go to class and you will get an a

1.0,M,this was one of the most boring classes ever been to i literally did not take one note except the class before each test he would simply read throught the tests and go over the answers if you mind the ridiculous banter and just want an easy a this is the class for you if you have difficulty attending boring classes do it
4.5,M,professor edgerton really knows his stuff he also tells us about his opinions on different matters which makes the class more interesting only exams but when you study the study guides and take notes be fine i got an a in this class

3.0,M,he was a great teacher for once you get use to his teaching methods there is reading for every class with a study guide the tests both lecture and lab follow the study guides and lab reports very closely so if you study it hard to do well on the tests but the tests are all write on and you have to be able to explain fun class

4.5,W,mrs leach runs the practical nursing program and teaches the harder classes sure she is hard on you but she expects a lot from you because nursing is a career where you must weed out those not cut out for the job as i am now working on my still fall back on things she taught me in class respect her not all care about you like she does
4.0,W,get ready for a hand cramp lynn is a great prof cause she knows her stuff is clear and organized but she post notes on ur courses or web ct and will fly through the slides in class there was so much material in this class chapters on the final and all comprehensive expectations for a level class were a bit high

5.0,W,this class was an amazing experience for me my bio background was beyond the intro level however the deep paper discussions were informative and her perspective as a geneticist refreshing her grading can be demanding but always fair she engages students with the material and i even got to work on a project directly related to her research
2.0,M,instead of v for vyse i accidentally clicked on b for boring no lie i suggest learning to sleep with your eyes open nice but scatterbrained and his classes i took and particularly hard
5.0,M,i took him for signals i must say he is the best the stuff really well this final was hard but the marking was him for any love his greek accent
5.0,M,i really enjoyed introduction to philosophy with werner he is very intelligent and has a lot of wisdom to share i would recommend taking his class to everyone
2.0,M,he mostly taught of whats wrong with plato and aristotelean views and why his philosophies are ignorant to abrahamic religions made me believe that he has never really read a bible or quran because he was off in his if you want to know his views hes had him his last semester so he must have already checked out upstairs
5.0,M,i liked this class a lot i thought that using movies to write papers on the subject matter was an interesting idea he used some audio cds in this class that were really good made us think about things we otherwise would not have
4.0,M,extremely tough grader and gives no breaks make sure you pay attention to that syllabus because he follows it word-to-word and gives no chances unless your dog died and you have a death certificate to prove it hard exams but the project is cool for the biological impacts of poverty class you will work your ass off in this class
5.0,W,a pleasant personality diligent and dynamic i thoroughly enjoy working with her on my project she is vesatile in all branches of computer engineering and always willing to give a hand when needed to sum it all up what an amazing prof
2.0,M,boring lecturer too much reading he was equally but the class hard study guides for all tests writing assignments were easy lecture was just horribly monotonous and totally useless rarely went
1.5,M,boring monotonous lecturer he could have made the material so much more exciting he always talked up the guest speakers to the point where it sounded fake too much reading but midterms hard
1.0,M,i had this guy last year and let me tell you that after every class i would go to my car and start crying he made me feel stupid and pretty much i was board but still tried very hard i was so frustrated again i left almost every class in tears
1.0,M,gillies is just a bad teacher plain and simple just bad horrible i was soooo unmotivated by his teachings i was just at a loss one of my first college classes and i wanted to quit college because of how bad of a teacher he is like if your a strong math or science student i think youll do fine he just created way to much anxity for me
5.0,M,very nice and enthusiastic professor his are pretty easy he is very helpful when you understand some questions even though he summarizes the textbook read and do the questions and you will be fine
4.0,M,definitely explains everything the fullest tried to be funny and make the class entertaining but like it is qms it never will be but good for trying tests are fair and pretty easy course cause he doesnt complicate things
5.0,M,best prof i ever had after failing qms i took the course again and got an a he is very patient and explains until you fully understand he would review the material learned in the previous class and give good examples if you attend his classes you will be fine
5.0,M,so surprised at the ratings this prof has recieved he is an amazing teacher he explains very well if you go to class and take notes you will do great he never tries to trick you and tests and exams are very easy great prof overall
3.0,M,mixed review as his explanations are hard to understand but he is a very dedicated professor who gives lots of support posts tonnes of stuff and seems enthusiastic he wont be a hinderance at all but the text pretty much teaches most things you need to know but i when he failed a basic stats question in front of the class
3.5,M,an airhead who teach well he makes mistakes during class and confuses you during class stick to the book sleep during class and be fine
4.5,M,a very good prof if stats is not your area of expertise take him he wil make you understand qstns on exams are diff from txt book but are the same as what he does in class attending class is recommended is a little condecending but whatever right as long as he explains things well thats what really matters
4.5,M,a passionate prof i could see how lectures could be dry if you were on fb the entire time instead of listening listen he has stuff to say he wants to know whether or not the class agrees with his open to controversy same with his exams if you work hard you will be satisfied with harvey
2.5,M,this class would be absolutely fantastic if it was smaller people in a class with an overwhelming amount of theories and case studies accomplish much i feel like i came out a bit empty-handed watch out for his exams they definitely overcompensate for lack of any all year
3.0,M,really nice guy who wants to be helpful and engaging but always successful it was massive class he crammed way too much information with no tutorials or assignments to help you along halfway the grade is split between the midterm and final exams overall a frustrating class disappointing considering the topics are very interesting
3.5,M,you can tell he is a really nice guy and very passionate about what he teaches his lectures can be dull but he is extremely accomplished in his field so it is overall a pretty good class despite the difficult subject matter
2.5,M,worst class ever stay far away from world poly sci class his lectures do not help you at all he has the worst reader ever made it is soooo borning and will costs alot of if you like borning profs who make you read boring expensive readers inorder to even pass the class harvey is your man stay far away from harvy and this class
3.0,M,incredibly erudite he has profound amount of knowledge in his head but he was too slow in lecturing and kinda old he used wolfgang behm as an assistant i talked w him after class alot that guy knows his plato and medieval philosophy like nobodys business and really helped cement what glanville was saying get wolfgang not glanville
5.0,W,took ms maleki for cna tough if you want to be a nurse take anyone but if you want to an excellent nurse take her she does pick favorites and will snap on you just blend in and stand out and just learn what she has to pass on to you
4.0,W,she is strict but she will help you if you ask she always has help material in her office if you are struggling with a topic she is willing to do what she can to help her students she tends to use other resources that are not required text but it is to benefit the students learning she has high expectations both of her teaching and her student
4.0,W,difficult subject but i somehow managed to get an a she is nice but gets mad if you talk in class she will help you any way she can attendance is only mandatory in that if you show up you have a clue what is going on the textbook is very helpful the only assignments are exams and term paper
4.5,W,i really like professor newhart she does talk quite a bit but overall i really liked her class i have never taken a philosophy class so some of the material was hard to understand you do have to write a lot in class and she always gives you good feedback on your papers i liked her
4.5,W,really good teacher provides many different points of view and life experience examples when possible always cheerful i wish more professors were like her tests are pretty easy if you read and do the study guide i would recommend to any one majoring in communication
1.0,W,she is ok as teacher nothing great i did hate dgoing to class because she is fake you can tell by the tone of her voice when she speaks its a put on she also needs to realize that comm is a required course and not everyones major so comm is not my life chem is a little more important tan comm to some people
5.0,W,she is a really great teacher and is one of the few profs i have had thats relates to students well she is very understanding and will give you test questions on a regular basis if you go to class i would strongly suggest her she does a good job at making class interesting and making the material understandable
3.0,M,he relies very heavily on his power point slides most if not all of his lecture is simply reading what the slides say he also moves too fast at times and says that the slides will be available on his website though they were not available until a week before the exam do the readings they round out the important concepts in lecture
3.5,W,she is very good
5.0,M,professario is an educated man you can buy the text book used online late edition but the book isnt necessary as he is a walking history time book and info is giving both accurately and from his gives a review before the two exams and with a recorder its a no brainer the presentation is easy you pick the topic
5.0,M,lwl meaning laughs while is an excellent teacher you learn alot and he makes it interesting
5.0,M,dr chapman is an amazing professor there is only one paper and the midterm and the final he is absolutely hilarious and he goes over everything you need to know for the the week before you take it best teacher had thus far
5.0,M,dr chapman was one of the most interesting teachers i have had at gpc his lectures are quite interesting and his lifetime experiences and achievements are quite an addition to his classes he does only offer two tests but he does his review with the test in his hand if you pay attention and take proper notes you will have no trouble passing
4.0,M,there were only grades short papers it get someone to help edit your paper go to class he will sometimes go over your head but read and write a well written college paper and you are fine i got an a and was pretty easy go to the class write your papers and read he is very smart but just listen to him and take some notes
1.0,M,i have never been so serious and honest in my entire years on earth about anything but i must say that this teacher is the worst teacher in history he lacks knowledge of this course he expects us to read and comprehend immediately during new lectures and he refuses to grant you extra credit if you fail poorly on the test omg beware pls
4.5,M,i found it rare to find a teacher like mr singleton who truly cared that his students not only did well in class but also progressed as members of society a wonderful mentor
4.0,M,did not understand well the class because of the language but what he talked in class was not hard the test is not difficult if u do homework even for international students

5.0,W,felt is a wonderful teacher and woman if i could have her as my professor for all subjects i would definately do it she gives just the right amount of work and always teaches the subject matter before assigning anything terrific i highly recommend her
1.0,W,i would not recommend her she rambles incoherently is unprofessional disorganized and condescending on top of all that she is not motivating or is depressing definitely not worth the time or money
5.0,W,hardesty is funny and her classes are straightforward and to the point write down what she writes down and you will ace the tests i never studied and i am getting an a if you can relate to the material or memorize you will do well you need a book well i use one

2.0,W,hard dont take her unless your really good in biology she is a very nice lady though
2.5,M,i hated this class i have never not liked a professor but i cannot stand this man if you have any conservative values run all he does is talk about how horrible conservatives are and how wonderful liberals are even when you can prove him wrong he will ignore any arguments against his teaching unfortunately i type enough for stories
4.5,W,great teacher make sure you go to class as she randomly takes attendance and gives you extra credit points very clear with her lectures teaches kinda fast but always has helpful homework posted
4.0,W,she is so sweet but if you get on her bad side she can be really intense she goes fast at times but over all she is a good teacher she reallyyyy cares about her job and her students she can seem kinda crazy if you appreciate her humor warning never leave class before its over unless you get permission before class to do so
3.0,W,if you are a fast thinker in math she is the best if not do not take her she is a sweet old lady but man she whizzes through everything so quickly inside of class and outside of it she goes way too fast and i was always lost if you think fast in math take her class
3.5,W,a good professor but she uses so many long metaphors to explain things do not come to class for attendance and leave without letting her know first seen her chase people out of class to get their names also buy the book and you will never ever use it not once
4.0,W,she is extreamly nice she will help you out as much as you need it if you are failing the class or falling behind it is because you dont pay attention in class or do the homework she is a great teacher and doing well in the class and not that great at math
4.0,M,a little intimidating at first but you get used to his style he throws alot at you and expects you to pick it up quickly the course was difficult at first but got easier when i got used to his style definitely read the books and go to class
2.0,M,very intimidating and impatient would not recommend him for beginners
3.0,M,very smart a truly impressive grasp on the language for a non-native speaker very difficult though and kind of mean he can be rude and expects too much in my opinion if you have to take russian with him you will certainly learn a lot but i recommend choosing someone else if possible
4.0,M,a little strange he barked at us the first day but a really good teacher and he is very good at explaining concepts in ways that american students will understand oral exams are really hard and expected to know a lot of vocab but the chapter tests are really simple just do the hw and be prepared for class and you will do fine
4.5,M,gerry was pretty much awesome the class was am monday to friday and i never thought about sleeping through it take him if you can
5.0,M,by the time in russian iv more is expected of you and once he knows you can do it treat you with a good deal of respect seems almost obsessed with covering more ground than just the textbook and is focused on all aspects of russian from pronunciation to paragraph structure great foreign language professor definite recommendation
4.5,M,ryan is a hard teacher and demands the most out of you but trust me in the end it will be worth it i discovered a passion for graphic design after taking his class and i am grateful i had a professor who only wanted the best from me and settle for meritocracy
2.0,W,where do i start feth is awful grouchy rude boring she disrespected everyone in our class and made us all feel stupid she was completely inappropriate at times bother asking questions or making light conversation good luck if you understand something i use the book at all just notes hardly went she was so mean
4.5,M,he treats his students with respect and likes to push them to think about their beliefs from all angles
5.0,M,simply would love to have a professor like him again if you get him truly lucky
1.0,M,i know where to start with this class you sit in your chair and you bang your head against the wall for minutes very boring and dull stecker is a nice guy and helpful but the material he covers really help you if you participate in lecture you should be alright the quizzes are misleading
1.0,M,this guy is impossible to understand online he gives more info than what is needed he could get to the point but take this class unless you want to work a week on it every class i have taken is easier than this one far easier
3.5,M,good guy but missing a few good teacher qualities great ways of explaining things but thinking of a concept slightly differently will be ridiculed he expects high levels of thinking even for basic ideas his grading is overly particular and will nickel and dime you to a lower grade past his corny jokes ego and aformentioned points ok
5.0,W,short story was great with colleen she is really the meow class was enriching but not hard doing the readings was fun two papers one presentation one small sweat but we still learned a ton about literature
4.5,M,took him for con law highly recommend the course his exams are tricky so be careful recommend reading treatise along with class readings if you are interested in judicial history he has some great stories oh and check out his wine blog
5.0,M,baude is a living legend a beautiful mind whose brilliance erupts in non-linear impressionist waves mixing history the law in a masterful melange no he give you an outline nor directly spoonfeed the info as evidenced by some of the inane comments posted but baude is a true renaissance man a gregarious genius who forces you to grow
4.5,M,really easy course had him for both lecture and lab never any homework he basically tells you exactly on the exams final cumulaive really monotoned though so have fun staying awake
4.5,M,dr anning is a great teacher his voice is monotone so easy to tune out but he always takes the time to explain everything if you need any extra help there are open labs at least twice a week where you can go and practice on the modles willing to help you outside of class if you need it he also gives tricks to remember the material
5.0,M,excellent professor humorous lots of energy and makes class interesting he is highly interested in ensuring that students understand the material in order to prepare you for the world after college he will explain things a million times if needed take him if possible
2.5,M,brilliant scholarly guy his seminars are really just lectures with fewer students but he can be entertaining to listen to and you can learn a lot from him had trouble keeping up with what he said sometimes though assigns tons of expect to get it all done be prepared for intense conference work
4.5,W,i took sipple spring quarter in i really really enjoyed her class so i took her again fall quarter of she is a very approachable professor her classes are mostly discussion but almost always interesting also willing to look over and give advice on students rough drafts of their final papers before due
5.0,W,i had sipple for english and took her again for because i really liked her she was really helpful and let you go back and fix papers before turning in your final one i highly recommend her especially if you are a strong writer
5.0,W,had her for winter and spring quarter very nice professor and helpful as well if i have a chance to take another class she teaches i will do so
5.0,W,impossible to not like her good talk down to students bad unfortunately now i want her to teach all my classes she is very likable and easy to talk to and while she keeps the line drawn more like a friend than a teacher bad only because hard to not want to have her as a friend great person
1.5,M,he is theeeee best stats teacher in all of uc i highly recommend him
2.0,W,i did not like this class at all the point value given to most assignments is not enough for the amount of work that you have to put in the instructions are not all listed but you receive a lower grade because she did not give all of the information gives chances to re-do assignments for a better grade but doesnt give enough points
5.0,M,he is a great prof
4.5,M,an awesome prof as long as you go to class do the work get an a most of all in class he even gives hints as to what questions will be on exams oh and you can e-mail him asking him questions and help you or take it up for the whole class really good i enjoyed his class
1.0,M,he is hard to understand
5.0,W,great class is very relaxed she understands things come up and is very willing to make it possible for everyone to acheive their desired grade funny can come off as a little arrogant but tells great stories cancels class a lot and lets us out early teaches what the class wants to talk about
5.0,W,i love mrs yancey she is so funny class notes come in handy for the tests but other than that her class is a lot of discussions she is from mississippi and makes fun of herself and her family a lot which is refreshing take her if you can
5.0,W,she is extremely easy not much work and only two tests all semester including the final
3.5,W,this class was very easy but boring we only had about grades and they were all simple really need to go to class she gets most of her information offline and just lectures from that if you want an easy a take her if u want an interesting class
5.0,W,i love love love this teacher she is very laid back yet she knows her material she try sugar coat it she states the facts there are test multiple choice and she your notes are your study guide this class is very easy if you come and do your notes and simply participate
5.0,W,she is so much fun hilarious she is very good and picking up the mood of the classroom and if she feeling well or if she could tell the class was just in one of those i want to go home moods she would totally let class out she gives study guides for tests and goes over them in class
2.5,M,this class is not that hard the only hard part is trying to stay awake listening to kinney lecture he is very boring but the material is not that dificult he reads directly off the slides and you can print off the notes i used the interactive website that goes alog with the book to study for all of the tests the final is not comprehensive
3.0,M,not a bad teacher just slightly boring possible to make an a in his class if you study hard for his tests complete the forum assignments and submit the page paper at the end of the semester
4.5,M,i would recommend this teacher the forum assigments do not take up much time and the papers that are due are not very difficult either all in all the tests are the hardest because it is timed and just definitions you have to understand the concepts he curves the grades too
1.5,M,i took online class py there is basically no work except on sundays when you have to complete a forum however the tests were hard u have read the chapters at least times to pass at least that is what he told me when i emailed him about my grade you have papers that are like pages long i suggest this class
2.5,M,this course is time consuming and difficult but the nature of the course content after done all the projects you feel a sense of real accomplishment arvo delivers the subj in sizeable chunks that are easy to digest he understands the inadequacy of some background and accomodates best professor period rewarding course
1.5,W,i actually loved spanish prior to taking her class back in i actually had one of my majors in spanish after her course i dropped it faster than you can say arriba not kidding i dreaded going to her class once a week for three hours it was torture she is not vey exciting we did everything by the not fun at all
4.0,M,buy a digital recorder you will need it take good notes re-listen to lecture re-write your notes trade notes with someone else and do great prof rose is straight up honest and helpful more chill if you get into the pm lab easy to talk to seems harder than he is do the work and get a good grade you have to earn i

1.0,M,worstttttt prof everr a waste of time he cant he is hard to understand he is not very open minded about other writing he expects you to write just like him all he do is go on you tube and watch videos and he grades hard
1.0,M,what can i say about this man he is nice but the course was a waste of time very disorganized and confused he only stresses your final paper in my opinion buy the books for some odd reason he grades too harshly if you write like him or agree with his points-expect a c what a semester i did learn how to master you tube though
1.5,M,really easy class take him if you have a lot of hard classes on your schedule and want an easy a requires a few papers but the rest of the time you just watch youtube videos in class more of a discussion class if anything i learned a thing from him only the videos
3.5,M,prof kojo is def unique he never had any lesson plans though we just watched youtube videos all class no need for the txtbook give any tests but just papers which were fair students use to always walk in after class and just sign the attendance sheet because the class would be in complete darkness while videos were running haha
5.0,M,great teacher really funny pretty easy all you gotta do is like reaction papers on a question in the textbook midterm final tests are a little tricky just study a little and you will be recomend him
5.0,M,if i had to dream up the best online professor it come close to professor delcastillo he is awesome answers emails very quickly and offers help if requested without a rude answer takes the time to write out key points of chapters and posts examples no midterm no final just perfect
5.0,W,quizzes are very important so you must read the one on john most helpful prof i learned a lot and enjoyed every text we read sometimes readings are lengthy but its college what do you expect at least she gives an intro to every text so your not totally lost
5.0,W,prof kaplowitz is one of the greatest lit professors ever had the pleasure of taking she is extremely clear she explains everything and she answers all of your questions there are quizzes every week but they be a problem if you read the book

5.0,W,very good professor she is very nice and has a lot of interesting information to share d
4.0,M,very entertaining prof he is willing to help very nice and laid back however he has no grading rubric and is not easy but it was a relaxing class with not much reading and only papers
4.5,M,he is a nice guy and his class is pretty fun he is a really tough grader though if you can take a different teacher for english i had professor king for english and did much better than i did in english with zorn
1.0,W,this class was terrible she explain anything she would be a great politician because every time anyone asks a question about what to do the answer has nothing to do with the question asked dont take her for any class not even underwater basket weaving
5.0,M,he is the best person to teach this course i hope he will be teaching again very soon
5.0,M,he was the best teacher i have ever had if fsu lets him go it will be one of the biggest mistakes they ever make if you have taken his class and you love him somethings worng
5.0,M,amazing awesome great teacher knows exactly what talking about take home quizes and test are in class are exactly the same as quizes attendance is mandatory but if anything understand regret it take him
5.0,M,very engaging and presents the material very clearly however caravanos always explicit with his expectations on assignments and is a slow grader he really made everyone become more about the environment however you need to ask questions for clarification in terms of what looking for
1.0,M,kept talking about his mother i know what got to do with mixing slip but there it is more interested in landscaping than teaching some folks should just not have tenure
4.0,W,dr kahan is an extremely intelligent very caring professor the class is difficult but she is very clear about what she expects from you so if you do the work it difficult to do well cognitive is probably the most interesting topic for this requirement i would definitely recommend taking the class
2.5,W,she is a good person but i feel that she asks for too much as an undergrad who never plans on going to grad school for psyc she always wants more there is no way to avoid her put it this way i would rather take human neuropsychology than take a class with her
4.0,W,the readings too tough or very long that coupled with the fact that she reviews the readings in class makes it easy to be prepared for her tests the class was interesting content-wise and she just made it that much better goofy and her dream journal assignment was fun her grading policy is simple but strict do what she asks
5.0,W,this is the best math teacher you want to pass take class is extremely easy and she is a cool teacher
5.0,W,she is the bestestestest teacher ever i love her so much she does not understand how much she helped me in math this semester taken this course once before and failed because i did not like professor toussaint looks exactly like a frog but she helped me earn wonderful grades on test and homework if u do not like make this is who you need
3.0,M,this class is difficult he is not always easy to understand and sometimes him and not the topic however passionate about what he teaches willing and available to help you never condescending or mean when you understand patient he listens and he will help you he respects commitment to quality
2.0,W,this was the worst class i have ever taken at fit a nice woman and she knows about the industry but she does not know how to effectively teach i had to teach myself the whole semester using the textbook because her methods were terrible i suggest dropping this class
3.0,W,i aced her class but her exams are hard why she words the problems differently than the hw and quizzes to do well review the exam with her after you take it you will probably get a c to an f go to her office ask for your exam and question every problem on the exam understand her wording and be fine go forward
2.5,W,i think a nice lady but not the best teacher i took two of her courses so far and both of them were so slow and boring
5.0,M,awesome teacher his study guides are literally the test impossible not to receive an a in this have to be a moron no attendance is taken
1.0,M,if you wanna class that you take very little noted cant understand the teacher and you learn nothing in class then this is the teacher for you he talks bout his life more than anything you do need to stay with the schedule or you will fail map tests are easy and chapter tests are easy and you can retake them but i wouldnt pick his class to tak
2.5,M,the first day he seems hard to understand but you get used to it his class as a whole is simple do the study guides and homework he gives you attendance is not necessary as long as you keep up with the work if you ask him a question though he tends to turn it around and ask you the exact question you just asked him so not helpful in that sense
2.0,W,it is an easy class however she has her obvious favorites you could do an incredible job on your speech but if she like you or your topic you will get a c just be very politically correct and you will do fine
2.0,W,she screamed at the top of her lungs at my class on a regular basis it matter if you have a great speech unless you do absolutely everything her way and she has her obvious favorites
5.0,W,her class is a lot of fun work hard and you will get a good grade
5.0,W,her class is a lot of fun just follow her lead have a good attitude and put forth good effort students from years gone by stay in touch with her she will go outnof her way to help you
5.0,M,prof muckell is an amazing professor those who say his is a hypocrite or his life is a lie need to see the real world and get their bubble popped his work is challenging but you will learn if you do the work
4.5,M,mr kinder may come off as serious but i believe he wants you to be serious about your training and skills you learn he is very knowledgable and i loved the class so worth it for the cost everyone should take self-defense i would take it second time
5.0,M,professor patierno is easily one of the best professors ever had helpful kind polite and extremely knowledgeable all of his tests are made up directly from his notes so as long as you show up to class every day and study your notes get an a i highly recommend taking one of his classes have fun and learn a lot
5.0,M,i had him my first year of college and he made it so interesting he is honestly a great professor he gives and answers your question no matter how dumb it may be he gives types of test a vocab and notes and he drops the lowest test grade read the texbook and thats it easy take his again if i could
5.0,M,the best professor you will ever have in every way just do all assignments and study the notes he gives you for his multiple tests and you will get an a
5.0,M,this professor really knows how to conduct a online class he is a awseome professor who makes the subject very fun
4.5,M,great professor he gives all your work in advance all his work is clear only bad thing is he does not respond to emails and the exams are extremely confusing and hard
5.0,M,he is a really cool guy and will help you out if you need anything he has five exams but if you miss any you can take the exam on a make up day for any reason in class its good to go but not mandatory he gives really good examples mainly read the book for the exams and you will do fine
4.0,M,really really funny guy i was interested in almost all his lectures very knowledgable lots of homework and quizzes but easy grade boosters loved this class
5.0,M,dr reardon is an amazing teacher who is very passionate about his work and the success of his students strongly encouraged classroom participation get your work done on time he allow late credit

4.5,M,very funny and easy teacher was willing to work with you on problems quizzes are easy even if you read the book beforehand restrict project ideas he let a guy make an add for a wife remote and lots about guns and explosives very helpful and knows what he is talking about
4.5,W,i love this woman she is so was very surprised be fooled on the first day when she acts tough and says that she is not your friend she is one of the sweetest funniest teachers that i have ever had she makes class very interesting and tells hilarious stories about her personal experiences
2.5,M,he is a really nice guy and is really for bio he hasnt been the best posts important lectures online without explaining them and goes into a lot of depth on lectures that that boring videos youre not tested on pointless and wastes class have his priorities guy
1.0,M,this professor should not teach he does not actually care about whether or not his students fail he does not give instruction but rather is a grader and when he does give feedback not productive he just tells you what you did wrong there is no helpful criticism he is just out for an ego boost
5.0,W,she made it easy to give speeches in class loved how she made us do warmups on speech day
5.0,W,freaking awesome super enthusiastic so never a dull moment she seems to really care about her students i really enjoy her class and would recommend her to anyone
5.0,W,very sweet lady she is caring and wants to help you the class itself is fun only thing i would change is to not have pop quizzes but its college so kind of silly
3.0,W,is a easy professor is you do all of the online work rude when you try to approach her outside of class her power points very helpful and her lectures do not help at all her directions when writing papers are very clear but it is still difficult to receive a good score on them the work is all online quizzes and essays
3.0,W,is an easy professor if you already know how to write a paper and able to commit your whole life to her class her in-class powerpoints and lecture does not match causing you to choose between what she is saying and her slide to take notes however its an easy a because its all online i never went to class and ended with a a
2.0,W,this professor seems to think that students can and should read her mind trying to write a paper for her is like trying to hit an invisible target her directions are vague yet her expectations when grading are very specific and annoyingly subjective she is also unnecessarily loud made a habit of wearing earplugs to class
5.0,M,really smart and a good teacher he gives a lot of extra credit for showing up to review sessions and open labs and will explain things you have problems with my favorite prof had so far
5.0,M,professor kent is extremely smart and makes it clear he wants his students to succeed and understand the material he is teaching he gives you all the tools you need in order to pass his test he gives you so much material and lets you know exactly what is on the exam i would take him again
5.0,M,dr kent is awesome his lecture and labs are the most difficult ever had but also the best i graduated the rad program years ago and his classes helped a ton in the long run my advice worry less about the textbook and a lot more about what he says and writes on the board if you what he wrote on the board fail
3.0,W,she a bad teacher but not someone i would recommend to anyone else she makes you read a lot of books which great but as long as you an english major be fine we were supposed to have five papers and we only did three and she cancelled class like four times
5.0,M,professor cherry was a great professor although he was hard of hearing he consistently did his best to get everyone involved in class it is unfortunate that he is retiring to become a surf instructor in california as he will be missed by the entire villanova community
1.0,M,this is a terrible professor who does not care about his students his homework assignment instructions are vague and if you write a wrong code but has the same output he will show no mercy he does not explain things well but expects you to retain the information anyway i do not know how he is still a professor here at sjsu worst experience
3.0,M,hes alright but the hype is really unjustified his rating should be around lectures are out of the book and homework problems are obviously way different than the generic book examples weekly quizzes on the unit circle got old after awhile when one little mistake could cause a not a bad guy though
5.0,M,best professor i loved math class with mr moliassa he explains the curriculum pretty well and always available if you need help especially if you show him you care about doing well in the course he will do his best to help you be prepared to work though you regret taking math class with him
1.0,W,run far away i repeat do not take it she was aware her entire class was full of nursing majors and were forced to take this class for our core classes and made sure she made it as difficult as possible her lectures are dragged on and she talks about the same topic for minutes also the power points do not help they are literally slides
1.0,W,professor griffin is very rude she missed class at least three times for personal reasons which is fine life happens but lets hope it doesnt happen to you because she will give you an f for missed assignments no late turn ins she is unreasonable rude and unhappy i worked extremely hard and still for a d her grading is bias
5.0,W,i took english and with ms griffin during my freshman year her classes are not easy but if interested in learning or are up for a challenge and ready to receive a lot of constructive criticism this is it i made a c in b in but after that i made nothing less than a in every paper i wrote throughout college
1.0,W,the absolute worst professor i have ever taken i have had lots of professors i am a hard working student who cares about my grades she is and worst care at all about the student and just likes to give bad grades just for the fun of it also no structure in the classroom had to go to her boss just to fix my grade
1.0,W,i was a first time freshman in college taking ms griffin and she was okay to start off but over time she became very annoying and rude she was out spoken and spoke to me like i was a child most of the time she steps out of her place a lot jokingly or not i wouldnt recommend to anyone
3.0,M,overall just fine he seems to push his political stance on students every chance he gets and argues with students when they agree with him after a while i stopped attending class and still got if you turn your papers in he will give you the credit and probably not even read them its more graded on completion than anything else
5.0,M,david is awesome and funny he might be retiring soon so he is slacking off on harsh of assignments he uses many ways of teaching videos lectures acting something out etc its a history class so expect it to be kinda boring
4.0,M,professor smith will make you work for an a but it is achievable stay ahead with your papers writing a paper the night before will not cut it the worst thing you can do to yourself is skip his class pop quizzes are frequent but easy if you take notes when he lectures and review them put in the work you will do great
1.0,M,difficult an inaccessible teacher he is one of the teachers that care about students mean and inconsiderate very boring lectures stupid quizzes find another teacher if you can
1.0,M,to save yourself do not take this class max is like a robot and his lectures are boring he gives pop quizzes which stinks and he only grades your grammar and punctuation he also does not give good feedback and is unorganized if he mixes up your papers with another class you will get an f on that paper for your own good do not take him
5.0,M,ian is a wonderful professor thoughtful understanding and he loves a good class discussion no quizzes no test just two writing assignments and a presentation he gives great feedback on everything he sometimes shares food with the class ask about his walnut paté but he never shares the recipes no matter how often you ask
5.0,M,whether or not you like him will depend on your style dr b gives a lot of hw and tests frequently this is actually helpful because you get a lot of opportunities to make corrections to your grade or tests total of which are in class with a group he talks a lot and often finish lecture so prepare to spend time in the ta help lab
5.0,M,physics is a really hard course because of the department i usually rate my professors but even though this class was so hard for me cuz no physics major he really is one of the greatest professors he cares about his students brillant definitely worth taking the class from put in extra time outside of lecture
4.0,W,dr ochshorn is such a sweet lady the class is based around essays which are easy as long as you put in a little effort then there are readings due every class with pop quizzes that are easy if you read drops lowest quiz grade lectures can be a bit boring but she always lets you out of class early sweet lady would recommend
2.0,M,he is probably one of the worst professors had horrible at explaining what will be on the test spends the entire class period just doing examples but never fully explains the subject this class should have been easy and all of my friends who have a different professor are doing good but because a bad teacher not doing well
1.0,M,prof abert is definitely a prof i will never take again nor will i recommend him to anyone i ended up catching the flu and missed the first test and he never responded to any of my emails and when i returned and asked to make up the test he said no and walked away the test i did take had questions also be prepared for nonstop homework
5.0,W,very real professor who gives no bs she tells you the way it is and what the history really was like she gives her opinion which tend to be very strong but hears other peoples opinions and respects them learned so many great things from this class and professor highly recommend
4.0,M,a cool professor who cares about his students sometimes really hard to reach outside of class lectures felt very long sometimes because he tends to talk a lot sometimes but makes them more interesting with visual aids a lot of reading that we did but he breaks it up so if you keep up be fine looking forward to part
4.0,M,o-chem is a difficult class focuses more on the mechanism of the reactions and few problems here and there although this may not be efficient for most students he really wants you to succeed he makes it possible to earn on at least one of the exams we got lucky for this is huge he wants you to try you slack you fail
4.0,M,ochem is a difficult class focuses more on the mechanism of the reactions and few problems here and there although this may not be efficient for most students he really wants you to succeed he makes it possible to earn on at least one of the exams we got lucky for this is huge he wants to do you to try you slack you fail
5.0,M,an awesome professor if you pay attention and copy all his class notes you can easily get an a in his class we had a quiz every friday about questions and tests in total he does assign homework but just so you can get extra practice and he even grade it i will definitely take him again
5.0,M,craig is such an awesome teacher the content isnt easy to begin with but he makes it better he cares about his students that is for sure kind of nerdy but in the best way take him you wont regret it
5.0,M,i love craig his zoology class was really interesting and so adorable in a sweet nerdy way honestly my favorite teacher ever had i just love his personality however his class was extremely hard for me i ended up getting a c and they was a miracle the tests where you had to identify species by their scientific names were horrid
5.0,M,professor stettner has a wide variety of knowledge about species from fish plants animals etc he takes the time to explain important concepts and is approachable by office hours or email if you have issues if you are not the best at science or not a good student there is more than enough extra credit to keep your grade in good standing
4.0,M,craig is amazing at first find him quirky and different but he grows on you i made the mistake of missing lecture a lot and that really affected my grade because each lecture he grades and gives points for participation he does offer a lot of extra credit and his discussions are outdoor and super hands on we did a lot good experience
5.0,M,he is by far my favorite teacher at this school he may seem cold at first but he is so caring and understanding with each student as long as you put in the effort you can pass with an easy a
5.0,W,one of the most enriching classes i have taken during my undergrad dr siegfried cares not only about her students but about their academic achievement and challenges you to become a better writer thinker and human her expectations are incredibly high and getting an a is a challenge so get ready to read and write but the work is well worth it
5.0,M,great lectures and articulates the concepts very well course materials are very well organized he provides slides that are fill-in-the-blank so you pay attention and not hard to with this teacher he also records his lectures along with the slides which is a big bonus
5.0,M,kraay was great lectures were amazing and he used so many examples if you understand the concepts if you go to lecture then you do well i use the textbook much but it would have helped good class
5.0,M,the course itself is really hard but if anyone was to teach it right him clear taught this course for a while because he is so good at explaining concepts that are really tough it takes time to understand but he makes it a lot easier and cares about his students get the textbook its worth it
4.0,M,the lectures were clear concise and they made sense prof kraay was well spoken and always knew what he was talking about he could answer any question the students asked him about the material
5.0,M,i freakin love this man best professor i have ever had his lectures are so clear and concise he knows exactly how to speak so that everyone paying attention really understands he also records his lectures and posts them so that students who miss class can easily catch up his tests are very fair and true to the content i loved him and his work
1.0,M,tests are way too hard for a first year mandatory class almost failing by second quiz so unnecessary to make this course so hard ya he cares but doesnt make it easy so whats the point
5.0,M,pretty easy as long as u have him just write what he emphasizes in class and you are golden dont ever try to write in ur own words just write down to highest degree what he says in class and lecture notes
2.0,M,nice guy and cares about his students but really tough course for first year and really hard tests ridiculously hard must go to class
2.0,M,exams are based on things discussed in lecture so you need to go to class papers are graded exceptionally tough he bell curve but the average always tended around a c even if you make the improvements based on his comments it mean get a better grade because of how subjectively he marks
5.0,M,this class is an easy a kraay makes the content easy to grasp with tons of examples and his lectures are great would take his course again
3.0,W,profesor hafeez is an okay math professor she knows the material pretty well the only reason you need to attend class is because of the poppers if you get something you can always ask her questions
2.0,W,not a very good teacher lectures are long and you walk away learning nothing take her i respect her origins but she has a heavy accent and quite hard to understand her sometimes also she is bad at math makes many mistakes and often confuses the entire class stay away from her if taking her in a big lecture
4.0,W,her class was an easy a the only thing you really need to do is just study her test and good she sometimes messes up but overall a great professor
2.0,W,took this class for winter mini i recommend her in terms of her notes since her notes are disorganize and lectures are pointless to attend if you plan on taking mini be prepare to work hard since this class test is like the practice exam so do it try your best to do well on the first exams since exams get harder there was no final
4.0,W,i had some health issues this semesters and she was very caring and willing to help class was a little boring mostly just grading your grammar worksheets together i almost wish it had been a little bit more challenging careful though she was a much tougher grader than i expected for the big projects
5.0,W,professor shelton was by far the best english professor i have ever had she works with each student personally in order for them to be as successful as possible she also has you work on one subject all semester long so all of the work you do is helping you develop your final paper she is super compassionate and loving to all
5.0,W,professor shelton was one of the best had my entire academic career she helps you understand the why behind the papers she gives she is very clear on her expectations and is very enthusiastic on what she teaches she uses the book pretty exclusively so google will not save you
5.0,W,i loved linda she was so fun even though there was a lot of homework she made it worth it because she would help you through it we did a lot of group assignments and group talking i would take her class again
5.0,W,she is like the little grandma that everyone wishes they had she wants her students to pass and will help them make that possible if she sees your effort she will work with you the whole semester was spent on writing the final paper by building it piece by piece funny and really helpful
1.0,W,she allows you to use notes on the tests but her questions on the tests are so out of the blue she has you read and write down questions regarding the text before almost every class and if thorough it could take around two hours her lectures are not posted online and they mostly consist of confusing charts or pointless stock photos worst
1.0,W,dr hall is a professor that you should avoid i went to her for help and constantly wanted to improve in her class but she care and help me she is very smart but not so good at getting the info across take someone else trust me
2.0,W,dr gubacs uses her class to present her work to up and coming teachers the class has no purpose she is very unorganized and the class was a hybrid and assignments are unclear she cares more about her outside stuff then her class i was extremely disappointed with the course she also loves to talk about how great she is
1.0,W,she will unleash the beast if she catches you with any technology in your hand most difficult class i have ever experienced professor seems as though she hates her life and likes to take it out on innocent students lecture slides are irrelevant and she talks too quick to catch anything drop this class asap
2.0,W,awful would not recommend unless you are in running start and have a job she says she goes over homework so you can have the right answer when you turn it in not true runs through class so fast and expect you to pick it up and repeat it back but unless u already have somewhat of a solid foundation in spanish you will be left behind
1.0,W,if you have any other time commitments or have a good foundation of spanish already then you are in for the worst class of your life i spent about hours a night just on homework alone that we went over and it never helped because by the time you fixed a mistake in question she was on question
4.0,W,hays is definitely set in her ways but shes fair her rules are simple i dont know why its hard for people to follow them dont be on your phone come to class prepared and dont disrupt class she wants the answers on tests in a specific way but she gives you exactly what you need to study word for word so its not hard
1.0,W,this class is a complete waste of time the entire class time is spent filling out worksheets with no explanation on how to actually teach the material to children her tests are mostly fill in the answer and are information from the book that has nothing to do with what is gone over in class
5.0,W,hays is really sweet and nice if you use your phone she will call you out as long as you pay attention and do your work you wont have a problem with her her test reviews are really helpful when it comes to the test so do them make sure you go to class in order to to edmodo big part of grade
5.0,W,professor maguire is a smart and kind person she goes above and beyond her everyday teaching responsibilities to make sure every student is successful during the semester but she is not a pushover
1.0,W,her lectures were long and boring talks wayyyyyyy too much class is optional but be there for labs to pass test were online but we probably ruined that for future classes be prepare to spend on the book for homework finally be prepare for lengthy homework which includes readings and multiple choice questions
3.0,W,julia is a very smart professor who knows what talking about however she know how to explain concepts properly especially for harder accounting classes afa she goes really quickly through the course materials which leads you to major confusion and she really show you how to write good cases but expects you to be good
5.0,W,tied for best professor after credits of classes she will never have you read anything that extremely useful ask for much but always challenges you can be abrasiveprepare for tough lovebut you will grow very experienced pass her classes up if you want to learn to write better this is my class with her
5.0,W,wonderful professor generous with her time cares about students gives honest helpful feedback knows her stuff one of my favorite classes at ou
5.0,W,i had prof gilson for a workshop-style class being a published author herself she understands how to balance supporting the work while still pushing them outside of their comfort zone to help find their inner voice if you are serious about your writing want honest feedback in a creative setting prof class is ideal
1.0,M,hes very rude and talks nonsense to the whole class he gives out answers but changes the subject too much i feel like i am not getting the proper learning i should be getting hes worse by far i dont understand how hes an easy class of does not teach but talk useless information i am trying to get a career here
3.0,M,he gives bonus points every test plus extra credit constantly you have to show up but if you do youll get the extra credit constantly tells nutty stories
5.0,W,will tell you exactly how to do well in her class and will never set any traps the lectures are clear and she gladly answers your questions she may look stern to some people but she is actually pretty approachable and has great sense of humor go to class if you need to do the homework and her practice exams and you will do well
1.0,W,she gave me depression
4.0,M,in my opinion this class was not difficult at all as long as you actually studied and prepared well for his iclicker quizzes his test questions are very direct and fair you need to buy his textbook just his lecture book so that you can write notes in it yes he does have strict rules but very funny and makes lectures entertaining
4.0,M,his lectures will either bore you out of your mind or have you laughing every minutes quite entertaining and really funny during lectures however very strict he has a very strict policy about cell phones or any electronics for that matter and i suggest not even thinking twice about using it during lectures
2.0,M,go to class random quizzes for attendances class is grades by points no phones follow his rules and you will be fine dont buy the textbook his notes are online test are the notes he uses clickers he sends emails thing that you need to read print them them to class they might be for extra credit
3.0,M,i had dr brooks for bsc and he is very knowledgeable in what he teaches on the exams his word choices are very tricky so when studying for the exams make sure you are very certain in what studying otherwise the wording could potentially trick you he gives unannounced quizzes so study before each lecture
2.0,M,brooks is not a good professor he lectures very heavy and if you pay attention you pass tends to make fun of students and can be funny at times but other times he takes his jokes too far to the point where he is very disrespectful he will not change the way he teaches the course so bother taking him for biodiversity
5.0,M,very funny during lectures keeps you engaged for the most part and makes everything easy to understand took him for both bio principles and bio diversity and glad i did go to the lectures everything he says during lecture is fair game for the exams which are a bit difficult but if you pay attention and do what he asks have no problem
4.0,M,professor brooks is a character i had him for both bio-principals and biodiversity attend every lecture read the lecture notebook before class and do fine his exams too difficult and in my opinion were pretty direct his lectures are enjoyable but beware very strict no phones no laptops no technology whatsoever
4.0,M,if you want to study and i mean really study for the tests do not take him you will not pass funny and makes lectures atleast interesting but he is very strict and class is mandatory want to go anyways not a class you learn on your own you will need iclicker for random quizes that need to prestudy for solid choice
5.0,M,super intimidating at first and then you see he really tries to make the entire lecture time engaging be late talk during his lecture and turn off electronics for real tests are fair lots of pop quizzes so make sure you read topics ahead of time or regret it and he offers many extra credit opportunities
4.0,M,seems intimidating at first but just jokes around a lot he tries his best to make boring topics interesting so you fall asleep read ahead before class because he likes giving pop quizzes and a lot of the time the same questions come back on exams
5.0,M,this legend was the highlight of my first semester loud funny and likes to pick on his students out of mutual fun he literally says going to be on the tests this class was extremely easy just occasionally review i crammed the exams and still got on all of them dr frazier is just too boring just avoid her
5.0,W,this legend was the highlight of my first semester loud funny and likes to pick on his students out of mutual fun he literally says going to be on the tests this class was extremely easy just occasionally review i crammed the exams and still got on all of them dr frazier is just too boring just avoid her
5.0,M,one of the best professors ever had his lectures are so entertaining that even when mind-numbingly topics like botany present themselves he manages to grasp your attention i recommend him to anyone that wants to have an incredibly clear understanding of biology while laughing the entire time
4.0,M,this is one of the best professors i have had at this school his lectures are very straight forward and if you take good notes and study there is no reason you pass it is also an added bonus that he is extremely funny and really engages the class his exams are fair and a lot of times he will hint at questions he will ask during lecture
4.0,M,brooks has been my favorite professor at fau so far i am a biology major so this class is important to me but he made the class enjoyable even though the tests were rough just need to study well and do fine
5.0,M,i took psych comm society w prof milburn online the material he provides is very interesting and i really enjoyed the class he is extremely responsive if you ask him anything which is great the class is very straight-forward and what is expected of you is laid out clearly the work load is fair if you do the work you will do well
5.0,W,professor top is amazing she gives lectures that are super easy to understand and keeps your attention with fun stories and jokes she is good about giving memory aids which make information incredibly easy to memorize tests are incredibly easy if you takes notes in class she covers a lot of info in each class so miss if you can help it
5.0,W,carol topping is one of the best professors that i have had she is very interesting and knows what she is talking about just do the work and turn it in on time and you will pass
5.0,W,she was so understanding i tore my acl and had to miss a ton of class and i still made it out with an a
1.0,M,do not take this class if you want to waste your time spending minutes out of a minute class writing on the whiteboard saying nothing while writing is a waste of everyones time learning everything from si and just causes more trouble he grade anything only the do
5.0,M,dr betts is a wonderful teacher he is always willing to help if you need any clarification on anything really knows his stuff he makes you work for your grade but fair and clear on what looking for
5.0,M,professor damen is one of the most enthusiastic professors you will have you can tell he loves what he is lecturing about and it makes the class bearable he is clear on what he expects papers to look like and what the test material will be on if you need to take a history credit take this one
2.0,M,professor damen is a really kind and energetic professor however his grading criteria is so hard to understand he use canvas and your grade is basically unknown to you until a few weeks before the semester tests are all fill in the blank but good luck because hard lots of papers with very specific formatting and writing style
5.0,M,dr karpinski is by far one of the best professors at depaul university every time i left his class he helped me look at the world from a completely different perspective he is extremely understanding and is always there to help out simply put every professor should be like him you will miss out if you take this class
1.0,W,avoid i was so excited to take a feminism class she absolutely ruined it for me kept calling cisgender women born women and brushed me off when i brought it up class discussion felt forced and inorganic readings were excessive and unnecessary mandatory participation is a major drawback since she absolutely care what you have to say
5.0,W,great teacher if you pay attention and come to class you will do fine very understanding and always there to help she will reward those who try and comes to class would defiantly take again
4.0,W,if you at least attempt all of the homework do fine in dr class the start of each class will be spent going over homework and this is where most of the learning takes place imo as a teacher she was fair respectful and very accessible to all of us my only complaint is that we ran out of time near the end and had to rush
5.0,W,had her for two psychology classes and she is an amazing teacher and she knows what doing she also does her best to help her students and goes over the lecture thoroughly i recommend any of you to have her if you can
1.0,W,her teaching is elementary she literally sat us down during one class and showed us a video of a man showing the process of how a first grader learned to draw a butterfly to a bunch of other first graders very rude take the time to have conversations with students and if you question any part of her teaching she snaps at you
1.0,M,his lectures usually have nothing to do with the lesson nor do they relate to the textbook tests are all or nothing meaning you either get points in a question or points one little mistake in code and you lose all points i wish i was exaggerating your best bet is to hope his old tests make sense
5.0,M,dr g is a fun professor who loves sociology and helping students learn to love it as well he really cares about his job and it shows i would recommend taking him if you have the chance we had exams all online and pretty easy if you do the readings and go to class
1.0,W,unless you are going into a class that she teaches knowing all the material like you have your phd in the subject expect to struggle lots of grades which is helpful but grading based on its what she wants to answer to be in her opinion ta is just like her very rude and makes you feel dumb
3.0,M,i understand why people love him but i have some reservations sometimes aggressively pick on the kid in our class ask too many questions fair enough but i think the kid had some social issues and although i appreciated he was honest he might have done more to discourage than encourage brilliant professor though teaches very well
5.0,M,dr lombrana is the best teacher i have ever had he actually cares about his students and wants them to not only do well in his class but in their future careers he does make you work for that grade though
1.0,W,she goes off topic a lot one time in class we were discussing about literature and then all of a sudden we were talking about cinderella
1.0,M,face inadequate tests that will give you a lot of stress no canvas so be guessing what is your grade until the end of the quarter i will never recommend his classes to my friends
5.0,M,bob baugher is an amazing teacher he goes through and explains his lecture i really enjoy taking his class its definitely a good class to take if someone close to you has died
3.0,W,professor lectures are convoluted and structure she gives nearly no opportunities for student involvement that said she is truly passionate about her work and her students and it shows in the lengthy and helpful feedback she gives on the four essays she assigns the readings are amazing just too bad we get to discuss them
5.0,W,wendy ho is definitely a professor who cares about her students she is accessible approachable hilarious passionate and truly a one of a kind professor she takes the time to get to know her students and is encouraging yes her assigned readings and essays are challenging but she teaches so much and is a great resource i loved this class
1.0,W,she went through whole lectures too fast because her concentrating group was who already studied in high school or worked in accounting field i prepared for the first class with reading the first chapter but it was totally useless there were quite a lot of who already know everything and the professor taught them not us
5.0,W,i learned a lot just from talking with her very inspirational she is one of my fave teachers and i recommend her for computer classes she was super caring and would answer any questions you had i passed this class with an a just do the work and you will pass no doubt i loved her though super sweet
1.0,W,the instructor focused more on criticising students than helping them to learn and succeed thus i was not at all satisfied with her approach to treating students particularly those who did not speak english as their mother tongue and or those who did not have a background in learning english especially with resect to writing
2.0,M,what a funny guy yet such a horrible professor all he does is draw little figures and mumble tests and final are take home teach all he care about is project project project worst part is he teaches major classes and he is only professor for both of them
1.0,M,my high school football coach could teach better than this man attendance is taken through clicker quizzes that have huge effect on grades he is extremely rude on and belittles students no formula sheet so good luck memorizing all the equations for the final i guess studying hrs for the final good enough to pass averages rip
2.0,M,bakker is rude and condescending but his class too hard he moves fast and thoroughly explain everything but the book does and his tests overly complicated he does lots of clicker quizzes which can be stressful at times
3.0,M,martin is very difficult so if not taking this for future classes beware probably the best out of all profs but you need to do so many extra practice probs to pass study week before the test no matter what he can be rude but you need to put it the work he is the best balance so if you need future chem do it
3.0,M,i had him for both and if taking as an elective or as an engineering major do not take him if premed or chemistry related major power through and you will learn a ton which helps in later courses tests are hard but if you put in the work and do a lot of practice problems doable
5.0,M,great teacher kind of rude at points but you will definitely know chemistry by the end he is hard but fair and makes you work for your grade you get formula sheets for the test but with enough practice fairly easy to remember take this guy if you can
5.0,M,dr bakker is very prepared for lectures and is great about answering questions in class and outside of class he loves to see his students putting in effort so go to office hours when you have questions and attend as many recitations as possible his quizzes there help a lot too use all extra problems he gives and it will help for the tests
4.0,W,her class is amazing i love her lectures and she is very helpful and easy accessible her test are easy if you study i am going to miss her class
1.0,W,she did not put any grades in the system the entire semester i see how i was doing until the final grade went in and even then i see what i did wrong
5.0,M,dr baker really cares about his students the homework in this class was optional and there were tests and that may seem daunting but the tests were not difficult at all if you looked at the material did the homework this class could have been very hard but dr b went out of his way to make it easier for us while we still learned a lot
5.0,M,good prof and a funny guy his lectures can run a bit long but his sense of humor and tangents keeps them interesting of what you do in class translates exactly to the tests he also makes accommodations for the way the online hw works so getting the grade there too hard just makes sure you underestimate his tests and do well
1.0,M,i tried liking him i really did i really wanted to this class was awful it was the same content as section but he managed to drive it into the ground and not teach anything whatsoever for the love of all that is well in the world do not take this man for dynamic systems mahmoodi will not actively try to ruin your life
3.0,M,professor williams give fair tests but requires a lot out of his students computer assignments mandatory grade of c or higher to pass take very long to complete hours and are only worth of the final grade lectures can often be off topic and hard to follow as he moves fast with preparation and studying this class can be an a however
3.0,M,not the best in lecture be sure to pay attention during his review classes before exams as they always give the exact problem types that will be on exams typically curves the overall grade at the end of the semester as most students do poorly
1.0,M,do not take sharif for dynamics or anything for that matter he stands up at the front working examples with horrible handwriting and speaks incomprehensibly to make it worse he uses online tests and quizzes with ridiculously low tolerances and made us write down work but give partial credit for it would just take off points
1.0,M,i listen when i was told not to take sharif for dynamics and i wish i taken his class the material difficult but he only uses online grading and it makes it really hard to do well in the class even if you understand the material he also has a really thick accent and bad handwriting lectures are difficult to understand
1.0,M,the class consists of him standing at the front working out examples he never explains what he is doing or why and it is super confusing combine this with a large lecture hall his horrible handwriting thick accent and the lecture is incomprehensible the grade you receive is based on online pop quizzes online test during lecture period
1.0,M,paul was a nice guy but he was a ridiculously hard grader he had no grace with any grades over the top and should not be teaching he is too smart to be teaching college kids if you dont talk in class you dont get any participation points i would never take him again im telling you save your self
1.0,M,nice guys awful teacher just writes unintelligible graphs on the board and expects you to know what he is talking about even use the book at all only has tests and a quiz and a cumulative final this guy is way too smart to teach people who econ geniuses would take a different professor
5.0,M,i am an international student dr pecorino is the most responsible professor i met in ua his class is easy to understand so that i rarely read textbook after class the class and homework is much helpful for tests he is a very kind person i really appreciate for his help
1.0,W,seems like a caring lady but her teaching methods are awful she except late work even with a note does not reply to emails and is difficult to speak to i constantly felt like i was being judged by her when i participated in class because she is very opinionated i have all as except this class stay away
1.0,W,professor lee rants in class about her life when she does talk about the course reading she summarizes it sometimes inaccurately makes broad claims about it and introduces irrelevant ideas she expects students to agree with her for grades she tells students what her criteria is and says that she grades according to it but doesnt do so
1.0,W,do not take any class this woman teaches all she does constantly is rant and talk about her life she makes students read a course reader she created and do outline off it but she even cover them in class or outright lies about the info sher grading for everything makes no sense and what she wants from you any better
4.0,W,she opens your eyes to asian american women issues but make sure to do your outlines asap there is few hw and barely any quizzes so try to work hard on them midterm and final were essays a tough grader but you just need to understand and write in her pov visit her during office hours and sit in different parts of the classroom trust me
5.0,M,rick is such a great prof i feel like i can just sit back and learn in his class no homework or reading chapters assigned but not mandatory i dont see why anyone would object amazing lectures and easy a only downside is that he has cancelled class without email swears a lot very knowledgeable about worldly issues which is refreshing
4.0,M,pros this class is what he really likes doing so he gets pretty exited about it fun projects if you have time for them cons projects can be really hard if you have no experience in computer forensics reads off slides overall amidst the dry lectures and hard projects the class was really cool and the professor was helpful too
5.0,M,brett is a really nice and fun professor he cares a lot about this subject forensics and lectures were always really interesting to me his class consists of just projects and a final the projects are challenging and can be time consuming but they are overall fair he does a good job of helping you out if you need it
5.0,M,talhammmmm my man what a gem of a professor i had him for inorganic chemistry and it was one of my favorite classes sure inorganic chemistry can be hard but this man made it worth reading the textbook looking over his notes and studying for the exams he truly made this class enjoyable his exams are very fair so worth it
2.0,W,it was very difficult to earn a good grade she will write on the board notes that are verbatim to the book and explain it well at all if she can she sometimes refers to students for answers the programs had me sitting in tutoring for hours on end the review guides given are decent but very vague overall avoid this prof if possible
1.0,M,he pretty much expects you to go to class as he often covers important concepts at the beginning of class which he forgets to record his test questions are written in a very convoluted way which makes his test questions harder his explanations in class are often garbage so you will need often learn things on your own outside of class
5.0,M,just wow i wish that i could take his class for the rest of my college career we explored campus talked about everything and you really get to bond with everyone in class if you show up you get an a he wants to inspire you to get what you want out of the class which makes most people actually care about the assignments take this class
1.0,M,good as person but not as teacher very very hard if you are looking for an a you will never get it in this class do it in the essay i got after that he gave us revision essay so i improved my essay as per his suggestions and he gave me are you kidding me you have to be book author to receive an a in the essay hell no
4.0,W,this was an online class but she did a very good job of keeping instructions clear i liked her and would take her again
5.0,W,if everyone is quiet when she asks questions there will be a surprise quiz read even if you understand because if you ask questions she will keep explaining in differnet ways until you get it do not skip the review day before a test if you do well go to office hours and ask questions nice if she sees you trying
5.0,M,i understand why some people like him his lecture is very logic and helpful to understand materials his test is not bad at all as long as you study

5.0,W,susan is a great professor and offers a ton of extra credit it is extremely hard to not get above an a in this class no attendance is taken however there are quizzes throughout the semester most of the time you can use your notes she provides you the answer or gives you points for trying this is a very easy class for a up
3.0,M,weekly discussion posts that had to be done had to read the online textbook ta posts notes on bb that were helpful for the tests tests were somewhat easy answers are all in the textbook or in the lecture ppts for a freshman level class it required some more work than i liked read syllabus carefully he required us to send a welcome email
1.0,W,laura is one of the worst english professors on campus she is moody aggressive and tries so hard to be liked by her students that she comes off very annoying i took her for ewrt on campus and she was very unorganized and confusing she have a set calendar and her canvas page was a mess and she was very rude if you asked for clarity
5.0,M,i took his native american history class for credit and enjoyed it so much that i came back for us hist dr boucher is an awesome teacher and i genuinely learned a lot from him
4.0,M,great teacher and is straight foward i have had several math professors at parkland and he is the best i have had good amounts of homework but not strenous quizzes and tests are very clear and are similar to what you are actually studying in class
5.0,M,great professor if you do the work and post on the discussion boards you will do just fine he outlines clearly what is expected in papers and if you follow what he tells you to do not only will you get good grades but the papers are easy to write
5.0,M,iv taken two online classes with thom and have nothing but success in both of these classes he is very understanding and flexibility on late work although i was in condensed classes over the summer i feel rushed

5.0,M,ddht was the best class ever taken i enjoyed him in as well
1.0,W,the worst professor i have ever had arrogant and disrespectful to students have a question bother asking she will tell you to just rewatch her video lesson her quiz questions feel like just trying to trick you and make you second guess yourself organization of assignments in blackboard yeah forget that avoid her if possible
5.0,M,chaney was an absolute ray of sunshine his film class is fun and chill i had him for an and every morning he made waking up for that class a little bit easier we only had two projects and spent a lot of time talking about and watching films he loves when people talk in his class and he is very excited about what he does
5.0,M,absolutely loved prof chaney super hilarious and he knows what talking about within the film industry do your work and you will get an a two film individual projects midterm and final so not bad he loves when people participate and talk in the class though not many talked in our class maybe because it was an am
5.0,M,chaney is amazing had him for an on a monday and he made it totally bearable he is hilarious and gives you a lot of creative freedom take him
5.0,M,my favorite professor at eku in years hard grader but really rewards improvement writing assignments are short and easy he tells really great stories take the class for the stories alone
1.0,W,monica is by far the worst employee at uvic she is rude unclear and makes these labs as hard as she possibly can i get why to weed out the weak students who be furthering their degree in chemistry but she makes it miserable to want to pursue even if a student is capable enough i received an a in and am taking
1.0,M,he is awful his instructions are confusing he gives very long exam reviews and then not of it is on the actual exam you get a minute to answer each question on exams and they are the majority of your grade
5.0,W,amazing teacher ms phillips has great lectures miss them she gives practice tests do them the semester project was time consuming but you learn a lot labs are fun laid back and fairly easy lab reports follow rubric and you do fine one of the best teachers at tcc five stars
5.0,W,i loved prof p her assignments were not difficult film summary labs were fun tests are open book for the most part if you run into any life issues as she calls them email her she really cares about you definitely best instructor had online responds to emails did you know you feed your cat milk would take again if i could
5.0,W,prof phillips is a great teacher definitely one of my favorites at tcc she really cares i learned a lot but i had to work hard tests are fair usually there is a practice test start your semester project early i loved this class and wish she taught other classes
4.0,W,professor phillips loves her job and has so much to teach sit close listen be on time its a lot of work but also a lot to learn she is such a caring teacher and wants you to pass you find many professors like her so miss this
5.0,M,i really enjoy the amount of attention he puts into trying to understand where his students are coming from he is obviously passionate about his subject and has great practical knowledge which brings the philosophical concepts we study down to a workable level for undergrads
5.0,M,he is an amazing professor his tests hard at all he does have web assignments due every week but easy he is hilarious he makes jokes all the time but i genuinely laugh awesome class very interesting material i would recommend him times
4.0,M,dr ballard is a very interesting person he plays advocate with you a lot the hea class too hard with him he seems to become self-absorbed in his own ideals in lecture at times the tests are multiple choice and short answer usually making flash cards over content is fine for studying you have to work but not too hard
5.0,M,this course was engaging and prof hoyt is very well prepared for class make sure to read everything he tells you to read it will help you with the pop quizzes as long as you stay on top of things you will do great in this course prof hoyt is also very understanding and cares about your opinions and thoughts
5.0,M,what a nice man he cares about his students and is so helpful with assignments he is very approachable and wants to help you when you adk questions or need inspiration i was out sick for a while and he was so nice about it definitely take him
5.0,M,course itself is pretty difficult but lectures are the best thing to listen to he is loud and speaks his mind during class so as long as you can get pass that a amazing instructor to have
3.0,M,lectures well structured so a lot of self learning in this course exam questions come from assignments the textbook and a test bank his use of mcqs can be good and bad good because you can guess bad because you get part marks difficult to do well in this course but also difficult to fail
3.0,M,his exams are fair half multiple choice and half long answer and he gives partial credit even if you mess up i do a whole lot of work and i still almost got a b so try and an easy course
3.0,M,ok prof he likes to talk about concepts instead of solving lots of problems in class which helps with understanding but all the tests are only on the questions you have to attend dgds for that but all past tests can be found online with answers and he seems to reuse the same questions every year so its not too hard to do well on his exams
4.0,M,overall a good professor with all the bonus marks and gift marks he makes it pretty hard to fail his class he does extra review sessions before midterms and the final exam and really useful to attend them a great lecturer but be prepared to do a great amount of work in his class or you get a good grade
3.0,M,probably the funniest prof i had last semester he is a fair guy and gives you lots of opportunities to do well in the course he tosses free bonus marks go to there are quizzes that can result in bonus marks for or he provides you with all of his course notes which has everything you need for the course find old exams
5.0,M,very fair at marking and is really really funny his classes were the highlight of my semester wait for phy
5.0,M,professor rooney never missed one class meeting throughout the semester you must get the book for class the semester in all was quizzes midterm and a final and extra credit was available no homework everything for the tests are in his lecture miss his class if you want an a i missed classes and was able to get a b good class
5.0,M,dr snider was an awesome professor i had him for my freshman year first semester of chem dr snider has meaningful lectures and describes the material very well in regards to asking questions anything you get he will make sure you understand what he is talking about by the end of the class his office hours are open and helpful
4.0,M,snider is very caring and uses humor to keep your attention he wants to help you but you need to ask his tests are hard but as long as you study you will do fine
5.0,M,dr snider is amazing true his tests are very difficult and his lectures are in depth but he makes you want to do well in his class very easy to get help outside of class and makes it worth your while to go talk to him he is also great for lab
1.0,W,if you have an amazing photographic memory you will do well in this course you better be able to type wpm otherwise you miss the slides on the overhead and you need every word for tests and exams she is very unreasonable and finicky the way she marks tests so memorize if you take this course be prepared to study
1.0,W,amazed at the students who praise her and can only conclude those were students she decided were good enough to favor as she does this a lot she covers way too much material at an insane pace i type faster than average and could not keep up you better be taking only this course or have an amazing memory
5.0,M,this was a very difficult course but he always took the time to make sure you understood the material homework was optional but i highly recommend it since his quizzes are based off the assignments overall if you work hard and seek help this class going to be too bad
5.0,M,he is great explains things in multiple ways and can answer the questions asked in different ways until you understand homework is optional but is closely related to the weekly quizzes and exams he is silly and engaging which encourages class participation do the homework and ask questions in class and you will do great with the professor
5.0,W,shannon is probably the best psych prof at bu however my and choices are right behind her she always tries to make examples relatable so you are able to remember them better she also tries so very hard to be available to you and correspond to your needs if you have a chance to take a class with shannon do it
1.0,W,she is a very unreasonable tough grader attendance is mandatory although you are allowed to miss four class days she will not respond to your emails about missed work she hardly teaches so be prepared to read and seek tutoring if you have educational questions about a lesson she will embarrass you and ignore you as well
3.0,W,this teacher is very nice but she is very hard to understand the whole class felt like a huge waste of time i can truly say i didnt learn one thing knew from her the class really felt like she let students teach more then she did lots of test with very little extra points also lots of random papers online you have to do i would never pick her
1.0,W,dont take her she is extremely unprofessional talks about personal life in class a lot yet still expects you to somehow learn materials and take tests on them basically a huge waste of time and money tests are confusing and unclear will tell you wrong when you question her have to teach yourself basically
4.0,M,this class was really easy everything that was on the exam was somewhere in his lecture notes that he has for you on canvas if you read those and do the assignments then you should be fine
5.0,M,lian laoshi is an amazing professor he will say whatever is on his mind is very funny and genuinely cares about the progress of his students in class he explains things very well and will take a concept slowly if you do not understand in addition to class time he is willing to meet outside of class if you need extra help
5.0,W,professor malitsky is an excellent teacher for trigonometry the way she teaches is easy to follow and is and i am able to follow up with the lecture easily in the textbook she does not take short cuts in demonstrating problems which i like because the little math errors are easy to miss with shortcuts
5.0,W,a very empathetic instructor she pays attention to questions and feedback she wants you to succeed do your best and be fine
4.0,W,this professor was amazing at explaining how to derive the equations she was teaching us she not only explained why we needed to learn the material but applied it to real life if ever had officer hours with her find she truly wants you to learn the material and will help you in any way she can
2.0,W,professor malitsky was helpful with homework classes during lectures but her lectures were verbatim from the textbook so when i attended lectures i did not need to read from the textbook i did the minimum work for the class and scored the highest score on the final the material hard but the teacher is a little boring but she is nice
5.0,W,dilek sanver-wang is one of the dopest teachers in the game some would argue she is the goat in biology i suck at bio an english major but i got on the first midterms cuz her lectures are thorough if you look her up on the coc website a pic of her with an owl on her hand lookin like a straight g post again at the end
5.0,W,honestly it all depends on the student not good at biology at all but reading the book actually helped a lot because i grasp anything while i was in lecture there are midterms which are way better than just the one because be chapters at a time rather than chapters for only big accumulative midterm take her
3.0,M,professor reed is a great professor but if you are a conservative he may offend you in many ways he speaks greatly about bernieites but as soon as he brings up president trump nothing but garbage besides his harsh opinion in lecture the material he gives you helps you with the exams si sessions are a must if you want a good grade
5.0,M,if you enjoy history professor reed is probably the best you can get i found his lectures on point and enjoyable and he clearly has a vast knowledge of american history he provides many real world and personal examples that are useful and make the class more enjoyable he finds modern day things to compare history to to help you understand
5.0,M,john is an amazing lecturer his tangents are hilarious and usually relate back to the point this class was actually super interesting if you care about business in the slightest learning about its history in america is pretty tight ta was trash but the class was awesome it was graded on two essays but the prompts are given months ahead
5.0,M,attendance is mandatory but he makes that clear on the first day seriously why is it so hard for peeps to go to class easy quizzes online discussions a final exam and a final page paper incredibly organized textbooks and lectures are dense but informative great polysci professor
5.0,W,about to graduate and classes remain the most memorable if you are passionate and interested in the topic she is teaching you will learn more than you intended to the one thing that helped me earn an a in every class of hers was contacting her she wants to help her students i had phone meetings with her before every paper ewa is amazing
3.0,M,he makes some difficult concepts accessible and you can definitely learn a lot from his lectures which are engaging however he tends to take a very particular view of a lot of contractual issues and principles and is quite hard on students if they get exactly the answer he is looking for--this makes exams more difficult to do well on
2.0,M,prof critelli is clearly a clever person but i do not enjoy his reasoning i believe he is an old school conservative professor and that is toi obvious in his way of thinking he is not neutral in his thoughts and would take a class with him
5.0,M,he is a very sweet professor and does a great job to make sure we pass while understanding all of the concepts i loved his class
5.0,M,his assignments were all discussion posts which have many parameters he assigns a book that is a great read it hardly feels like work if you do the work then you will get the grade be sure to request for your article that is due at the end of the class you will know what i am talking about but be sure to request for them in advance
2.0,M,exams are open-notes and open-internet projects are relatively straightforward but small mistakes will lose majority credit however resubmissions are allowed if you want a chance at an a you need to go to him with well thoughout questions so you dont need to resubmit use his example code as the starting point for all projects
2.0,M,cares about his students but the projects are disgusting projects as said elsewhere or even with resubmissions the criteria for design points are subjective not written anywhere and missing any means a loss of of a project grade lectures were okay but finished early almost every day tests bad
1.0,M,the worst professor i have ever had i learned nothing of substance he nitpicks on quite literally every single possible thing you can nitpick on and his grading scheme is there to the detriment of students i read these reviews while picking classes last semester but think it was going to be this bad
1.0,M,not a great professor for so many reasons he teaches pretty clearly and seems like a nice guy until it comes to academics his grading is tough and almost no one feels prepared for his tests worst thing by far he calculates your grade different ways and takes the lowest why does he want people to fail
4.0,M,he knows the material been teaching it forever if interested in lower-level things and some hardware love the class otherwise still a pretty simple class start assignments early read the book before lecture try to find exams from previous years as he gives no hints about what will be on them the final was difficult
5.0,M,professor unno is a top-quality educator his passion for the subject is apparent in the way through which he presents the material incredibly knowledgeable and entertaining i do recommend that you keep up with the reading but if you get a little behind professor unno will cover the material thoroughly in class highly recommended
4.0,M,professor unno gives amazing lectures but at times they can be confusing or he gets off track he has a clear grading criteria but is picky in how he wants things done overall he is a kind professor who genuinely cares about his students and what he is talking about he is very knowledgeable and i would recommend him
5.0,M,amazing i looked forward to every class he is extremely smart and one of the leading ucc scholars if you listen to him you will realize he is hilarious and a true gem to pass do the readings and go to class he is always willing to talk to students after class on the bricks so participate in that when you can
3.0,W,make sure to go to class and write down how to do her problems if you go to her office hours she tries so hard to help you even though sometimes her explanations arent the best you can easily get a b even if you fail the final
5.0,W,professor chase is passionate about physics which can be seen by her marked enthusiasm during lecture she does a great job of explaining different concepts as someone who has always dreaded physics since high school professor lectures made physics bearable and in some cases even fun
3.0,M,his language courses are extremely tough and i have seen students cry during the oral exams he is very caring with those he believes to be making an effort but he is harsh on others take his class if you want to focus on your core courses hardest course taken and i may fail it
5.0,W,her class is a lot of work but it as hard as i thought it would be show up start early study for tests and ask questions if you need to there are pop quizzes but only points each you get to take them with your group and she checks them over before accepting them no reason not to get full credit
1.0,M,i would not suggest taking this professor he is incredibly difficult and the exams are impossible
5.0,M,he makes you work for the grade but he does give good feedback on how to improve also if you participate it can really help your grade
5.0,M,not a major but always loved music and dr d reawakened my love for choir he really cares about his singers just be ready for quartets and remember not the end of the world if you have to go in for re-sings
5.0,M,brother zenger is a fantastic teacher and he really cares about his students even if you like insects you should take his general entomology class it will change your life
5.0,W,cynthia was a great teacher she always answered your questions without making you feel like an most teachers she was so understanding and caring she is also funny which is a plus apply yourself and you have one problem
1.0,W,worst professor ever i have never had anything below an a in english and i have a d i have never been so dissappointed in a professor in my life she is terrible and she is very mean and often comes off as rude she calls people out and she tears them apart shes like a vicious dragon she skipped class more than i did and were way behind
5.0,W,i miss dr nina so much i am so honored to have sung under her
2.0,M,he was alright some of the lectures all that clear and sometimes he seemed a little unenthusiastic but not bad
5.0,M,wonderful professor truly cared that you learn and his efforts show it
3.0,M,his lectures were very clear and often simplified the material for us his midterm exam was much easier compared to other sections all in all he was a good teacher in class and kept the class entertaining with his slides however on the downside he would sometimes seem annoyed or bothered to answer questions outside of class or at office hours
1.0,M,a smart guy but cant teach at all he does meaningless confusing proofs the whole class the two comments below are tripping if you do get stuck with him just watch professor leonard on youtube he teaches the same material i strictly watched his videos and took notes and finished the class with a solid a
5.0,M,such a passionate professor and i loved taking his class clear that he loves his area of expertise and enjoys teaching people about the holocaust the books and readings assigned are very interesting and most often a pretty easy read i loved this professor
5.0,M,he is so funny and so kind his class is so much fun even if science interest you his lectures are never boring and as long as you come to class and pay attention the exams are really easy great guy
2.0,W,you can tell that she definitely knows what she is talking about but lecture is ridiculously long and boring she goes off on random tangents and many lectures she only goes over or slides because she is so long winded tests are hard but they prepare you for nclex i thought the paper was the toughest as she is an apa format freak
5.0,M,he has you discover the chemistry this has you understand why the rules are the way the rules are and understand why things work the way they do
5.0,W,i love this professor she is passionate about the subject and tries her best to get you interested as well tests are easy quizes everyweek but you can use your notes there is alot of homework but they count alot for your grade take her you wont regret it the sweetest prof at chaffey
5.0,W,really enjoyed her online class you know what is expected of you each week and you have opportunities to work ahead the course material was very interesting and overall i am glad i got her as a professor
5.0,M,dr tjandra is a very smart professor he definatley provides you the recourses to well in his class practice the hw problems as many times as possible and focus on the material he emphasizes in lecture dont fall behind because it will punch you in the face the deeper you get into the course he drops lowest test and has weekly quizzes
1.0,W,the modules due each week take at least an hour or more to complete we have online group work in which she expected us to email each other our work back and forth there is a page term paper at the end which is essentially your final and oh yeah she wrote the book so if you word for word repeat the book your answer wrong
4.0,M,professor spears is not the easiest marker and i will not be receiving an extremely high mark in his class but he is caring passionate and insightful he loves the material he teaches and loves to discuss it the essay was super fun to write the class needs a lot of time devoted to readings though overall would take again
5.0,M,prof spears is by far the best i have had in my entire university experience he was always so excited to start the lecture and actually cares about what he is teaching students taken two classes with him already and plan on taking any more that i can in my last year highly recommend taking any class he teaches
2.0,M,did not enjoy the lectures they were clear but i feel that he spent too much time on every idea thus we ran out of time occasionally and it could get boring he can call on students at random so be aware of being put on the spot instructions for our essay were very open-ended and this made it much more difficult he is a nice guy though for sure
5.0,M,he is a very tough prof probably the toughest i have ever had but he is by far my favorite he is a hard marker for essays and has high expectations but it makes you a better student he is great to just chat with about issues in class overall amazing guy totally possible to get if you hustle all year
5.0,M,one of the best professors truly an educator he makes your standards of other go higher he cares for your learning success intelligent funny approachable and he makes you think not for lazy people obviously welcome to university one of those that changes people lives for the better take his courses
5.0,W,took as a gen ed requirement she is very nice the lectures gets a little boring and she asks that you dont take notes in her class the midterm and exam are easy her study guide has the actual answers on the test two papers that you write but shes an easy grader would recommend for those who have to take as a gen ed
4.0,M,honestly i just go to class to look at him
1.0,W,the reviews are most definitely correct about her she is very defensive and wont let you get a point across she is very funny but rude at time the class is a easy grade tho the book is not really needed buy an online book for cheap
2.0,W,she is rude rude rude if you do not agree with her ask questions on assignments or try to take notes she will get defensive tell you off in front of the class or just give you a bad grade for that particular assignment just because she can this is by far the worst prof had since attending this school be mindful of the reviews
4.0,M,a nice guy with a dry and sarcastic sense of humor which i liked he gives you the questions to the quizzes and tests beforehand so you can just do them on your own time with the textbook and then copy them down in class from your notes make sure you keep up with the journal questions if you understan your grade helpful if you ask
3.0,W,the content covered is very interesting but the way that she tests you over it is not instead of testing over the themes of literature and the impact they had on history you are expected to be able to identify direct quotes there were only grades for the whole semester and one of those was a group project
5.0,W,took the online us literature i course very well organized had the entire semester laid out by the first day which made it easy to plan ahead her weekly outlines were a lot of help as she helped break down the assigned readings i did enjoy being able to pick my own topics for the two essays that were assigned dr lape is great
1.0,M,was pretty psyched to take a class on comics and although the material was cool and interesting the experience overall was destroyed by the arrogance he needs to turn down the bravado big time and come down to earth with the rest of us--he is such a turn off omg
1.0,M,found this professor to be pretty mediocre lectures were a sleep fest consisting mostly of the prof ranting about irrelevant things watch out if you disagree with his opinions cause it will cost you
1.0,M,really disengaged prof got high regard for his own ideas but little time and patience for anyone who disagrees with him shows very little interest in student success and does not make himself or his accessible for any kind of assistance outside of lecture acts like he want to be there and really care less
1.0,M,awful professor he uses his lectures as a soapbox for his political views which have nothing to do with the course his expectations on are very unclear and he offers no help whatsoever his essay questions are impossibly hard and when you ask for help he rolls his eyes at you like he be bothered worst prof ever
1.0,M,prof lesk is the most uncaring arrogant prof i have ever encountered he always thinks he is right and will give you a bad grade if you disagree with his opinions on no matter how well supported his lectures are banal and insights shallow his classes are a waste of time and money
2.0,M,very very specific about what he wants out of your assignments needs you to pander to his own views to do well in the class leaving not much room for originality and outside perspectives
1.0,W,this course is a self-discovery course so you would imagine for it to involve some degree of creativity she claims to encourage creativity but the truth is that she puts countless restrictions to what you can do in your work during lecture she says the same thing about ten times over and she leaves little room for actual artistic work so ugh
5.0,W,best chem professor for easily tests are harder than the other professors but such a good lecturer that it offsets it she also provides the opportunity for a point bonus each test that helps a lot you have to work but she makes it worth it
2.0,W,mcgill is a nice person but her lectures help you at all for the tests brace yourself for a lot of self-learning and self-studying you will have to do the tests will wreck you but aleks learning catalytics attendance and participation will really boost your grade at the end of the semester so good luck
3.0,W,mcgill is going to be a hit or miss for all of her students her style was very much pose a question and watch students struggle even if they were going in the wrong direction before explaining the right answer aka very roundabout in her teaching if you take her i highly recommend getting notes from students who have already taken the class
3.0,W,excellent lecturer gets you engaged and makes sure you leave class having learned something attendance is mandatory but you have to participate unfortunately she has ridiculously difficult exams and a luck-based bonus system which drags down your gpa other professors for the same course will have easier exams
5.0,M,dr stecker might be the best philosopher on campus but note that that entail he has the best pedagogy i recommend visiting him during office hours give feedback on papers and often willing to have discussions he seems to want his students to be the best philosophers they can be
5.0,M,dr thielen was extremely intelligent and provided us with all the materials required to pass the class his lectures were also thought provoking and entertaining
3.0,W,okay material is really boring and she help making it any better she loves to talk hour and fifteen minute class and she talks the whole time tell you a million times her husband is a pilot and loves to boast herself and talk about all her research but the class is pretty easy if you just study the power points
5.0,M,lee grenci taught me well his classes were interesting valuable for those who want to use the knowledge in their daily life this information helped me during my career with traveling picking places to live dealing with climate and understanding changes in climate and how the weather patterns affect us all i am grateful to this man
5.0,M,math you have to work on it daily if you want to understand the concepts this professor also created and posted videos of him teaching each lesson watch them and take notes and you will do fine he is actually quite hilarious in the videos and makes learning less intimidating there is extra credit and he helps anyone just ask
5.0,M,the best math teacher ever very understanding he loves teaching and it matters because when a teacher loves to teach students will actually understand better
5.0,M,prof leatham teaches in a way in which you learn or you from the very beginning he makes it known you control your own grade lots to read but most readings are interesting his style is relaxed honest invigorating and most definitely a giver pays close attention to detail and is forgiving of fault hands down def one of the best
4.0,M,professor leatham is a very unique professor i enjoyed his class very much a lot of reading lectures were always interesting and very good he baby anyone and gets you ready for the real world he tries to get you to really use your mind he breaks the paradigm of professor in a great way too many complainers in his class
4.0,M,really enjoyed this class his lectures are messy but be an adult and organize the information to how it makes sense to you go to office hours for any extra help he is really a sweet man and very excited to teach
5.0,M,best prof for econ knows his stuff well and interesting lectures
1.0,M,his lectures were not helpful and the final exam was ridiculously hard other profs provided slides with detailed information to their students while bruce hammond only put a few graphs on his slides my friend is currently retaking and you know what most of the people from that class were from bruce class last semester
4.0,M,before the tests i just studied the text book and i never got less than a on any of them because he gives you a free text book on the first day of class you do not need to take notes all the material he covers is right in the book this spring semester of is his last semester ever so npvc will lose one of their greatest professors
1.0,W,i did not enjoy her really bizarre book choices at all a ton of work to do for her class and way too much reading to do outside of class also if shy be weary because she really wants a lot of class participation
3.0,W,she does care about her students i can give her that the only problem is she goes way too fast with lectures and a difficult time trying to understand the problems when she immediately moves on to the next how are we supposed to learn from that every other week she gives a quiz and i think we should go over the problems more before
5.0,W,amazing professor fin is a difficult class but she explains everything so well you barely need to go over it in the textbook she is very accessible outside of class and will see you at any time you need tests are difficult but she scales them and she gives you extra credit she takes pride when you do well in her class
5.0,W,i took photography class in she was excellent at motivating individuals with photographic art i the best photographer but i did enjoy the projects and they surprisingly came out well i always admired my classmates and their creativity with her projects she was excellent thanks kathy
5.0,M,professor potter is the best sociology instructor he genuinely cares if understanding the material and is more than willing to help lectures were quick and informative his one-line jokes are an added bonus definitely take professor potter if you have the chance
5.0,M,he is the best professor ever he is by far the best sociology professor love him he is very flexible with his schedule he always asks students if they need help with their essay questions
5.0,M,love this guy great professor to take for sociology the winter course is very condensed though making studying for tests hard wish i had taken him during a full semester lectures were great you can record too and he is very nice about getting you a free online book so that you can use it for the course also hump days on wednesdays
4.0,M,pretty easy doesnt post grades at all though he doesnt believe in using much technology no homework really except studying and the workbooks which he helps out with
4.0,W,this one of those classes you can cruise through with minimal effort be ready to show up for class and to put in some real effort the tests are tough but you soon catch on to what she is looking for lots of specifics i thought she was an interesting lecturer and used plenty of real-world examples to make the material relevant
3.0,W,dr dogru was a good professor in my opinion she gave very tough tests but was always fair the class consists mostly of her handing out packets of the material and were expected to work on it with a group she walks around and if you got stuck she could explain it many different ways she is a very smart woman and rather challenging
5.0,W,amazing lecturer and fair grader absolutely love her
4.0,W,great lecturer and overall great professor she knows her materials and explains the process of nursing rather than reading straight from the powerpoint however like any other nursing classes be ready to read the text only so much time to cover all the materials
3.0,W,she teaches really good her exams were based off everything she teaches i did not understand math and she made it so simple my only issue is class attendance i missed class once and was not able to make up her work even though i had an injury five points from an a skip class you pass also beware of group work
4.0,W,professor españa is great im terrible in math and passed the class with decent grade if you participate in class she gives extra points on the tests tests cumulative test if you havent done good on the others easy class highly reccomend
4.0,W,this was the easiest class ever she is the sweetest and she is soooooo nice
5.0,M,professor allen is a very good teacher i had a hour class with him and he keeps it entertaining an easy grader he genuinely cares and will teach you how to do certain things before you do an assignment i would take him again in a heartbeat if i can
5.0,M,amazing professor has a bit of ocd when it comes to papers and how he likes it done but a lot very easy very lenient and gives you opportunities to make up your assignments
5.0,M,great professor his class is really easy to pass his work and essay topics are essay make sure to turn in work on time and pass my favorite thing about allen is how he grades he is not a tough grader at all i write so good and all my essays have been higher than a b his classes boring so time goes by fast
5.0,M,professor allen is very inspirational if you like to write you will like them he makes class entretaining and is very caring
5.0,W,nike is a real gem and she cares very much about her students she is sometimes a bit difficult to communicate with during classes but absolutely hilarious and a little patience goes a long a way
4.0,M,very funny professor of his lecture is him telling stories he gives out extra credit questions when attendance is low exams are really tricky a lot of stuff is on them that was never covered in class also is slow to respond to emails and to grade
1.0,M,youll wonder why you even bother to show up to class which consists of personal stories and repremanding you for not having a commanding knowledge of material he never covered
4.0,M,he literally gives you everything you need to get an a technically he even gives you the quizzes and exams just fill them out and study them and youre all good
5.0,M,its true that dr gordon is always it is also true that he quite possibly one of the most unorganized professors i have ever had he probably will never give your paper back or any feedback but having said that he is probably the best professor i have ever had he even try and i have learned so much in his classes
5.0,M,i took my first class with him the summer before my freshman year it was in and my first college course and i loved him i took another course later with him and loved him also then it has been many years but his teaching still impacts my life he was one of the reasons why i eventually changed my major to sociology
1.0,M,his class was unbearable
3.0,M,he is an okay professor he knows what he is talking about but he is pretty difficult he grades speeches on the harsher side it is not really easy for many people to speak in front of others and i feel like he forgets that he always uses the way he speaks as an example but has been doing it for so long hes a pro while were still adjusting to it
5.0,M,good guy and good teacher have to attend to pass some stupid rules he has but that big of a deal necessarily have to pay attention but have to read the book and do problems in workbook tests are very straight forward some questions directly out of the work book very easy a
1.0,M,avoid his class under all circumstances
1.0,W,the organization of her class is very hard to understand a tough grader the organization on her blackboard is tough to understand so make sure to double check everything to not miss an assignment if you miss an assignment your grade will suffer badly if you can avoid her class take her
5.0,M,super sweet laid-back professor is willing to meet with you outside of class if you missed the material one day and explain anything you understand also answers emails relatively quickly he really cares about the students and wants you to succeed in post-grad life
2.0,M,lectures are very i just read the book know the answers to his own questions assigned us a whole project that was not in the syllabus days before the first part of it was due very vague in what he expects of you and if you ask questions he just rephrases them and makes you feel dumb for asking in the first place
4.0,M,the good the weekly readings topics varied among articles chapters out of books good stories and interpreting rap cyphers keeping the topics engaging is important because like i said weekly papers sometimes say he told us something that i recall him saying i told you guys a million times do this and that when lol
4.0,M,great professor he is always willing to help no matter what he is definitely one of the best english professors that tcc has to offer
5.0,M,mr potter is very good teacher you do have to study but he cares he knows the material and will give you extra help if you want
5.0,M,he is a great and knowledgeable professor all the bad comments are from students who are just lazy and are trying to get a good grade without putting any effort
5.0,M,he is very smart very knowledgeable and easy with the homework and he was generous when it came down to curving test grades
5.0,M,not sure why he has a when he deserves a a wonderful professor and as long as you do the work
5.0,M,you would not waste your time on his class i wanted to become a better writer i learned a lot from his class
5.0,M,he is very funny i would take him again
5.0,M,i really appreciate him opening the new door for me i think it was decent amount of homework i learned a lot from him it was a little hard to catch up in his class and the assignments at first but his always makes sense and logical he spared a lot of his time every time i asked questions i would take his class again
3.0,M,prof richardson teaches this global health class from his personal perspective of opening a health clinic in africa he has a lot of experience and makes it super cool to listen to you will know more about neglected diseases than you ever wanted to but love it he really cares about the students and wants you to do well hard but worth it
