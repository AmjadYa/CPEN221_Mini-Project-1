I started serving College Students lunches and waffle suppers in a small way in my parlor and selling homemade candy. My business became very popular with the College Students and I was obliged to extend my facilities. So I had three rooms arched and made in one large room and decorated very prettily. The room seated 104 students very comfortably and was very popular among the students and their friends as it was one of the most attractive Tea Rooms established for College Women.

Buy those that have been boiled but a few hours. The heaviest whether large or small are best. In opening them care must be taken to remove the poisonous part. This lies in the head, all of which must be thrown away, as well as the vein which passes from it through the body. All the other parts are good. Break the shell with hammer and cut open the body on the under side with a sharp knife. Carefully examine the tormelly or green part to see that there is none of the poison vein in it. If you are going to make salad put it on a platter, the meat from the body in the centre and that of the large claws at each end of the dish, arrange some of the small claws around the edge. Garnish with lettuce and serve with a boiled dressing. Deviled Lobsters. Cold boiled lobster taken from the shells, cut up in small pieces and equal amount of bread crumbs mixed in milk, a very little red pepper, salt, a good deal of butter and if liked a little mustard ready mixed is added, after washing the shells replace the mixture and bake in a quick oven. This mixture can be made into balls, dipped into beaten egg and rolled in cracker and makes delicious croquettes if fried. Oyster Stew.

Rub this under the skin of the knuckle and sprinkle a little powdered sage into the rind where it is cut and rub it over with pepper and salt and place it in a hot oven. 8 lbs. will require about 3 hrs. to roast it a light brown.

POULTRY AND GAME CAUTION:--To roast fowls the fire must be quick and clear. Baste frequently and if you don’t use a double roaster, keep white paper pinned on the breast till it is nearly done. Take the turkey, draw it and wash it clean and dry with a clean towel. Turkey Dressing. Take 1 loaf of stale bread, free of crust cut into inch cubes and pour over it 1 pint of hot milk, stir it all soft and smooth, then beat an egg light and add to the mixture, season with pepper and salt and poultry seasoning, 1 table spoon of melted butter. Then stuff your turkey with this mixture. Then sew it up and draw legs back close to the body and the wings back against the side so that the breast will stand out prominently. Dust the turkey with salt and pepper and drawn butter, then lay on a grate in the roast pan with down. This permits the juice to run down into the breast and makes it tender and juicy. The oven should be very hot when the turkey is first put in and the heat slightly reduced after the first ¹⁄₂ hour. Cook in the original position for the first hour then turn it over on its back and cook until a light brown, allowing for cooking 15 minutes to a lb. Roast Duck. After drawing the duck, wiping out with a clean towel, do not wash them, cut off wings to the second joint. Roast in a very hot oven from 15 to 20 minutes in a baking pan containing a little water, any one of the dressings may be chosen for the filling but I use just the plain dressing and always serve apple sauce with duck. Chestnut Dressing. Take 1 pint of chestnut, prepare the nut by making a cut in each with a sharp knife. Then put them in a kettle, cover with cold water, bring to a boil and boil exactly 2 minutes. Remove from the water, drain, turn in a pan with a little butter and shake over fire, after this the shells and skins may be removed together. Chop the nuts, add a large cupful of grated bread crumb, 4 tablespoonful of butter, melted, 1 tablespoonful of shredded parsley, ¹⁄₂ teaspoonful of ground poultry seasoning salt and pepper to taste. This gives rather a dry dressing and sufficient hot water to mix to a paste may be added if a moist dressing is preferred. Oyster Dressing. 1 quart of oysters will be required for an ordinary sized turkey. Grate into a mixing bowl 4 large cupfuls of bread crumbs, add a teaspoonful of chopped celery, drain the oysters either chop or leave them whole, 1 salt spoonful of white pepper, 1 tablespoonful of chopped parsley, and 1 tablespoon of melted butter, and add the cup of oyster liquid. ¹⁄₂ cup of sherry may be added. Fricassee Chicken. Singe, draw the chicken and disjoint it, put a ¹⁄₄ lb. of bacon in a sauce pan and let the fat fry out slowly. When the bacon is crisp lift it out and put it aside. Flour the pieces of chicken, drop them in the hot bacon fat, shake and turn them until brown then draw them to one side of the saucepan. Add to the fat 3 level tablespoonfuls of flour, mix and add 1 pint of boiling water, stir until boiling, add a level teaspoonful of salt, cover and simmer gently until the chicken is done (1 hr.).

Cook for 1 hour and ¹⁄₂ until brown and tender. Creamed Chicken. Prepare it the same as for fricassee chicken, put in a kettle, cover it with water and let it cook till tender, before removing from the kettle season with salt and pepper, then remove from the kettle when cool, remove it from the bones and thicken the gravy with 2 tablespoonsful of flour in a little cold water to dissolve the flour, then add 1 cup of milk and cream and serve with hot waffles. Waffles With Creamed Chicken. 3 eggs beaten separate, then add 1 pt. of milk, 1 large tablespoonful of melted butter, 1 even teaspoonful of salt and flour enough to thicken the same as for pan cakes. Stir all together with 2 tablespoonsful of Baking Powder and the whites of the eggs beaten stiff the last thing. Have waffle iron hot and bake until a light brown. This will serve 6 people. Broiled Chicken. Prepare the same as Fricassee chicken then split open through the back.

BREAD Three things must be exactly right in order to have good bread, the quality of the yeast, the lightness or fermentation of the dough and the heat of the oven. It requires careful attention and good judgement to decide when all are right, no precise rules can be given. Good Bread (White) Scald 1 qt of milk when cool add 1 Fleischmann yeast cake dissolved in luke warm water. 2 tablespoons of sugar, 2 tablespoons of lard or butter melted, 1 tablespoon of salt, stir in 6 qts of sifted flour or more, enough to make a stiff dough, then put in a bread pan or deep bowl to rise over night. In the morning knead and put in pans. Let rise to the top of the pan. Put in hot oven, bake 45 minutes. Grandmother’s Old Fashioned Yeast. Wash pare and boil 6 large potatoes until soft. If the water boils away very much, add enough more to make about 3 pints. After removing the potatoes from the kettle, add to the water in which they were boiled a very small pinch of hops. The water should be but slightly colored. Let the water boil hard for 10 minutes, now take a large pitcher or earthen crock which will hold 2 to 3 quarts. Put the potatoes in the pitcher and mash them smooth. Then add ¹⁄₂ cup of flour, the same of sugar and a tablespoon of salt, being sure to rub out all the lumps. Place a fine strainer in the top of pitcher and as the hop water boils, add 1 or 2 cups of water and stir again until all is smooth. Then add the rest of the water. There should be about 2 quarts of yeast. When just warm add ¹⁄₂ cake of magic yeast. 1 cup will raise a sponge for 5 or 6 loaves. This yeast should be as thick as thin cream and about the color. This yeast will rise very quickly and when it begins to foam, stir 2 or 3 times. Do not bottle yeast but keep in the pitcher and place a saucer over the top. Keep in a cool place in winter and in the refrigerator in summer. It will keep sweet for two or three weeks. Whole Wheat Bread. Take 1 Fleischmann yeast cake, dissolved in 1¹⁄₂ cups of lukewarm water. 1¹⁄₂ cups of milk, scald and cool. Then add 2 tablespoons of lard or butter melted. 3 tablespoons of sugar, 1¹⁄₂ teaspoons of salt, 7¹⁄₂ cups of whole wheat flour, stir until a stiff dough. Then place in a deep bowl to rise over night and in the morning mould out in tins let rise again. Then put in the oven to bake 1 hour, bake slower than white bread. Steamed Brown Bread. 1 cup of Indian meal, 1 cup of molasses, 1 cup of rye flour, 2 cups Graham flour, 1¹⁄₂ pints of sour milk, 1 teaspoon of soda, 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 egg. Mix the dry ingredients together, dissolve the soda in two tablespoons of boiling water, add it to the milk, molasses stir well and pour in the other ingredients, beat the egg and add it. Mix thoroughly and pour into well buttered tin pan that holds 2 quarts. Steam 4 hours and then put in the oven for ¹⁄₂ hour.

Take 2 cups of milk, scald and cool, then add ³⁄₄ cup of sugar, 2 tablespoons lard or butter, ³⁄₄ cup raisin, 1 teaspoon of salt, 6 cups of sifted flour, then add the yeast cake. Mix a stiff dough and put to rise in a greased bowl to rise overnight. In the morning knead out in loaves and put in greased pan to get light, then bake in a hot oven. Nut Bread. Dissolve yeast in a little warm water, take 2 cups of milk scalded and cooled, then add 1 large tablespoon of lard or butter ¹⁄₂ cup of sugar, 1 cup of chopped walnut, 1 teaspoon of salt, add 6 cups of flour or more, to make a stiff dough and set to rise over night, in the morning when light, knead and put in pans to rise again and when light bake in a hot oven.

Then set to rise overnight and in the morning knead the bread and put in greased pan to rise until light. Then bake in hot oven 45 minutes. Wheat Muffins. 2 eggs well beaten, add 1 large tablespoon of lard or butter, 1 large tablespoon of sugar, 1 level teaspoon of salt, beat this all together, then add 1 cup and ³⁄₄ of milk and flour enough to make a stiff batter to drop from the spoon, lastly 2 teaspoon of baking powder, place in hot greased muffin tins and bake a light brown. Whole Wheat Muffins. May be made in the same way as the above receipt using whole wheat instead of white flour or corn meal, graham all made the same. Rice Bread. Allow half a pint of ground rice to a qt. of milk, or milk and water, put the milk and water over the fire to boil, reserve enough to wet the rice. Stir out the lumps add a large teaspoon of salt and when the milk and water boil, stir in the rice, exactly as when you make gruel. Boil it up two or three minutes, stirring it repeatedly, then pour it out into your bread pan and immediately stir in as much flour as you can with a spoon. After it is cool enough and of this be very sure, as scalding the yeast will make heavy, sour bread, full of holes, add a gill of yeast and let it stand until morning. Then knead in more flour until the dough ceases to stick to the hands. It is necessary to make this kind of bread a little stiffer than that in which no rice is used, else there will be a heavy streak through the loaf. It is an elegant bread, keeps moist several days and is particularly good toasted. English Muffins. 3 eggs beaten light, 2 cups of milk, 1 large tablespoon of melted butter, 1 teaspoon of salt, ¹⁄₂ compressed yeast cake dissolved in lukewarm water.

Rub the marks gently with a little piece of glycerine, then rinse it in lukewarm water, lay cloth over the damp part on the wrong side and press with a cool iron until dry. To remove Scorch. To remove scorch from linen cut an onion in half and rub the scorched part with it and then soak it in cold water. The mark will disappear. To Keep Out Moths. First shake each garment then brush or beat it and hang it out of doors if possible. Spray the box or trunk which is to hold the woolen with turpentine and line it well with newspapers. Fill the trunk or box with garments laying them smoothly and with newspapers between them and over the top. If moths should be seen during the warm months just sprinkle the top papers lightly with turpentine or kerosene as the odor will disappear very quickly. To Clean Furs. To clean white furs buy 5 cents worth of plaster of paris and sprinkle the article to be cleaned, rubbing lightly with the fingers or a soft brush, dust and if not clean repeat. It will clean much better then corn meal, requiring but a few minutes and the article looks like new. Transcriber’s Notes The transcriber advises caution in actually replicating the recipes, which often seem to be missing ingredients or instructions or have seemingly very odd proportions.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life. Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS. The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate. International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff. Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support. Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition. Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: www.gutenberg.org This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
